     Statement of Senator Barack Obama on International Human Rights Day Monday  December 10  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  DC    The following statement was submitted by U  S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  in the Congressional Record today on International Human Rights Day      Mr  President  today is Human Rights Day  Fifty nine years ago today  thanks in large measure to the tireless leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt  the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights      The principles encompassed in the Declaration are uniquely rooted in the American tradition  beginning with our founding documents  Yet the Declaration also wove together a remarkable variety of political  religious  and cultural perspectives and traditions  The United States and the United Kingdom championed civil liberties  The French representative on the committee helped devise the structure of the Declaration  India added the prohibition on discrimination  China stressed the importance of family and reminded UN delegates that every right carried with it companion duties  Today should be a day of celebration  a day when we hail the universality of these core principles  which are both beacons to guide us and the foundations for building a more just and stable world        The Universal Declaration was a radical document in its time  and its passage required courageous leadership from political leaders  Even though no country could have been said to be in full compliance with its provisions  including the United States where Jim Crow still prevailed  all UN member states committed themselves to promoting  protecting  and respecting fundamental human rights  Although Franklin Delano Roosevelt did not live to see the enactment of the historic Declaration  it enshrined his    four freedoms       freedom from want  freedom of speech  freedom of religion  and freedom from fear  Individuals in the United States and everywhere else were entitled  simply by virtue of being human  to physical and economic security  The Declaration was born of the recognition  in the words of one human rights scholar  that    what is pain and humiliation for you is pain and humiliation for me           Anniversaries are a good time to examine how faithful we have been to our own aspirations     to ask ourselves how well we are measuring up  to assess whether our practice lives up to our promise  We in the United States enjoy tremendous freedoms  but we also carry a special responsibility     the responsibility of being the country so many people in the world look to  just as they did in Mrs  Roosevelt   s day  for human rights leadership        Today  on this anniversary  we must acknowledge both bad news and good news  The bad news is that for nearly seven years  President Bush has ignored Franklin Roosevelt s wise counsel about the corrosive effects of fear  Indeed  instead of urging us to reject fear  he has stoked false fear and undermined our values        Wounded by a horrific terrorist attack  we were warned that Saddam Hussein     a man who had nothing to do with that attack     could unleash mushroom clouds from nuclear bombs  We were told that waterboarding was effective  We were assured that shipping men off to countries that tortured was good for national security  We were led to believe that our military and civilian courts were inadequate  and so we established a network of unaccountable prisons  And the Administration launched secret wiretapping initiatives  scoffed at the rule of law  and flaunted the will of the Congress          Nonetheless  in his second inaugural  President Bush rightly proclaimed     America s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one     But  tragically  he has failed to heed his own words   We have not only vacated the perch of moral leader  we have also compounded the threat we face  spurring more people to take up arms against us       The further bad news is that other countries have not stepped up to fill the void left by our lack of moral leadership  The hundreds of thousands killed and two million displaced by the genocide in Darfur  the shell shocked Buddhist monks in Burma  the political opposition in Zimbabwe  the imprisoned independent journalists in Russia  the brave human rights lawyers and judges in Pakistan     they do not know where to turn internationally  Human rights abusers win seats on the UN Human Rights Council  the International Criminal Court issues war crimes indictments  but no country steps up to enforce them  the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations begs in vain for troops  helicopters and police to help stave off humanitarian catastrophes  For all these reasons  the world needs renewed  principled U S  leadership       There is another critical reason why America must again provide moral leadership on human rights  the fate of women around the world  Whether it is in creating wealth  access to capital  and property rights  or receiving quality education  health care  and social services  women still lag far behind men   And of course the lack of full reproductive rights can be a matter of life and death for too many women  Inequality means insecurity for women  especially those who comprise 70 percent of the world   s poorest  There is a clear link between discrimination and violence against women  equality and empowerment of women is the most effective approach to ending violence against women  Today  violent acts against women  in the words of UNICEF     are the most pervasive violation of human rights in the world today           Women   s inequality and the persistent prevalence of honor killings  trafficking  repression  and sexual assault nearly six decades after the Universal Declaration shame us all  One need only look to Saudi Arabia  where a 19 year old woman  who was raped  instead of receiving treatment and support  was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison for riding in a car with a non related male   In the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Darfur  rape is routinely used as a weapon of war by militia and government forces   In northern Uganda  young girls are given as    prizes    to older male soldiers to reward performance        In Pakistan  international observers report that one of the largest challenges facing its next election is guaranteeing women enough security so they can leave their homes to vote  In Iraq the militarization and rise of radical Islam has eroded women   s rights  In Afghanistan  while nothing can compare to the day when the Taliban ruled the entire country  women throughout that country complain that their freedoms have been woefully curtailed  The United States alone cannot solve the problem of women s suffering and gender inequality around the world  but with new  principled leadership  the United States can elevate women s economic  political and social development to the top of our international agenda and ensure that women around the world know that they have a reliable friend and partner in America      Let me close by saying that the very depth of the anti Americanism felt around the world today is a testament not to hatred but to disappointment  acute disappointment  The global public expects more from America  They expect our government to embody what they have seen in our people  industriousness  humanity  generosity  and a commitment to equality  We can become that country again                                   Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be

      Obama  Green Applaud House Passage of Bill to Aid Homeless Veterans Thursday  July 10  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                          CONTACT  Samantha Burch  Green  or Michael Ortiz  Obama                          WASHINGTON  DC   The U S  House of Representatives today passed H R  3329  the Homes for Heroes Act  which will provide shelter for homeless veterans and their families and help prevent very low income veteran families from falling into homelessness   Rep  Al Green  TX 09  worked with Veterans  Affairs Health Subcommittee Chairman Michael Michaud  ME 02  to introduce the Homes for Heroes Act in the House in August 2007   This afternoon  the White House issued a  Statement of Administration Policy  stating that the Davis Bacon Act s prevailing wage requirements included in the bill will make H R  3329 subject to a veto by the President    The bill was introduced in the U S  Senate by Sen  Barack Obama  D IL  in April 2007   Today  the House took an important step in honoring our military men and women by passing this critical legislation that will help eliminate homelessness and provide affordable housing opportunities for our nation s heroes   This is the least a grateful nation can do   Rep  Green said    As the House sponsor of the Homes for Heroes Act  I especially thank Senator Barack Obama for championing this bill in the Senate and commend my colleagues in the House for voting to provide those who have sacrificed for our country with the assistance they deserve  I urge the President to reconsider his threat to veto a bill that will ensure a brighter future for all of our veterans    Our veterans have made incredible sacrifices for our country  and we must do everything we can to provide these heroes with housing and job opportunities when they return home   said Senator Obama    Unfortunately  far too many of these brave men and women are living on the streets  and that is unacceptable   I am proud to support this legislation  which will go a long way in meeting our commitment to our veterans   I commend Congressman Al Green for his leadership in moving this widely supported legislation through the House   I urge my Senate colleagues to pass this bill as soon as possible  and I call on the President to sign it into law   On any given night in this country  800 000 persons experience homelessness and  according to the U S  Department of Veterans Affairs  VA   nearly 200 000 of these homeless Americans are adult veterans who live on the streets  in shelters or in community based organizations   Nearly 400 000 veterans may experience homelessness at some point during the course of a year   Of these    47 percent of homeless veterans are Vietnam veterans Half have mental illness Two thirds suffer from alcohol or other substance abuse problems 56 percent of all homeless veterans are African American or Latino   This bill not only brings to light the plight of up to 400 000 homeless veterans  it brings them one step closer to being able to say they have achieved the American dream of a home to call their own   Providing our veterans with affordable housing and supportive services is the least we can do for those who fight for us   Rep  Michaud said  The Homes for Heroes Act will   Establish a  200 million assistance program for supportive housing and services for low income veterans  Expand the highly successful Department of Housing and Urban Development   Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing  HUD VASH  Program  authorizing 20 000 vouchers annually and making the program permanent  Authorize  1 million in HUD grants to assist housing and service providers with the execution of their housing projects for veterans assisted by HUD  fulfilling the planning and application process  and assisting veterans in obtaining permanent housing or homeless assistance   Establish the position of Special Assistant for Veterans Affairs within HUD to coordinate services to homeless veterans and serve as a liaison to the Department of Veterans Affairs  state and local officials  and nonprofit service organizations  and Require HUD to submit a comprehensive annual report to Congress on the housing needs of homeless veterans and the steps HUD has taken under the programs provided for in the bill                                Pursuant to

Law  Thursday  July 10  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                 CONTACT     Brian Fallon  Schumer   Adrianne Marsh  McCaskill   or Michael Ortiz  Obama  DOJ Has Not Consistently Enforced Federal Law Requiring Disclosure of Foreign Influences on U S  Policy Democratic Senators Urge Inspector General to Examine DOJ Decision Making Behind Enforcement of Lobbying Regulations Senators Have Also Proposed Bill To Close Loophole Exempting Lobbyists For Foreign Corporations From Reporting Requirements WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer  D NY   Claire McCaskill  D MO   and Barack Obama  D IL   today called on the internal watchdog at the U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  to investigate the agency s spotty enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act  FARA   a federal law requiring disclosure of all lobbying contacts made on behalf of foreign entities such as governments and political parties  The senators believe that there have been severe lapses in the enforcement of FARA  allowing certain foreign agents to operate without the sunlight of disclosure  Disclosure is important in order for the American public to know who is influencing U S  policy from abroad  the senators said   Too many lobbyists are skirting the law and operating in the shadows  and in too many cases  the Justice Department is standing at the light switch  refusing to turn it on  We want answers   Schumer said   The public has a right to know when our government is being lobbied by foreign interests and the Department of Justice has a responsibility to uphold and enforce the law in all circumstances    In a place where we need more transparency  not less  lapses in enforcement of lobbying disclosure laws should not be taken lightly   McCaskill said   This is serious matter  and I expect the Inspector General to address it head on to assure the enforcers are truly enforcing the law    It is unacceptable that lobbyists can exploit loopholes to hide their lobbying contacts on behalf of foreign businesses and governments   said Senator Obama    The American people have a right to know who these individuals are representing and which American officials they re lobbying   Abusing the law to hide access and special treatment is exactly the kind of Washington culture that I ve been fighting against   I am proud to stand with Senators Schumer and McCaskill to close these loopholes  and I call on the Justice Department to immediately investigate this abuse of the law   The intent of FARA  passed by Congress in 1938  was to bring transparency to the work of lobbyists representing foreign clients by requiring the lobbyists to register with the Department of Justice  But in recent months  multiple cases have surfaced where lobbyists acting as foreign agents have either registered with the DOJ late or not at all  Violations of the disclosure law that go unpunished can undermine U S  policy and pose national security risks to the American people   Furthermore  any specter of uneven or lax enforcement can render a very important statute toothless   Senators Schumer  McCaskill and Obama today asked the DOJ Inspector General for a report on the Department s enforcement record on FARA  including an analysis of all the considerations taken into account when the Department determines whether or how to enforce the law  The Senators have also called on the Inspector General to take appropriate steps within the Department to look at the causes of uneven or lax enforcement and provide the Attorney General with suggestions as to how to fix any enforcement problems immediately  In June  Senators Schumer  McCaskill  and Obama unveiled legislation that would close two loopholes allowing U S  lobbyists to influence government officials on behalf of foreign clients without having to disclose their activities  The Closing the Foreign Lobbying Loophole Act  S  3123  would require all lobbyists representing foreign clients to register under FARA  even if they have already registered under Lobbying Disclosure Act  LDA   Under current law  lobbyists registered under LDA are exempt from also registering under the more rigorous FARA  The bill would also require that any lobbying contacts with U S  officials on behalf of foreign clients be disclosed even when they occur outside of the United States  Currently  the law only covers contacts that occur  within the United States    A copy of the Senators  letter to DOJ Inspector General Glenn Fine is below     July 9  2008 Mr  Glenn A  Fine  United States Department of Justice  950 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington  D C  20530 Dear Mr  Fine  It has come to our attention that there have been severe lapses in the enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act  FARA    We would like to know more about the decision making process behind FARA enforcement and whether or not enforcement has been uneven or lax over time   As you are well aware  FARA was passed in 1938 and requires disclosure of all lobbying contacts made on behalf of foreign governments  individuals  political parties  and corporations   Disclosure is important in order for the American public to know who is influencing U S  policy from abroad   Recently  we introduced the Closing the Foreign Lobbying Loophole Act  S  3123  in order to close two loopholes in the law that allow certain foreign agents to operate without the sunlight of disclosure  We believe that the requirements under FARA are clear and should be enforced in all circumstances   Violations of the disclosure law that go unpunished can undermine U S  policy and pose national security risks to the American people   Furthermore  any specter of uneven or lax enforcement can render a very important statute toothless  We know that you share our commitment to maintaining the public s trust in government   We believe that allowing individuals to break the law and operate in the dark on behalf of foreign entities will erode this trust we hold so dear   Therefore  we request an examination of the Department s enforcement record on FARA  including an analysis of all the considerations taken into account when the Department determines whether or how to enforce the law    We hope that you take appropriate steps within your Department to look into the causes of uneven or lax enforcement and provide the Attorney General or his appropriate subordinate with suggestions on how to fix any enforcement problems immediately  We also request that you transmit to us  and the appropriate congressional committees of jurisdiction  a report on your findings  We look forward to hearing from you on this matter     Charles E  Schumer    United States Senator                                                      Claire

                                  Durbin  Murray  Obama Introduce Bill to Update Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury for Military Thursday  May 10  2007   WASHINGTON  D C       U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  introduced legislation  yesterday evening  to improve the care of veterans and service members suffering from traumatic brain injuries  TBI    The bipartisan Military and Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Act would establish a program within the Departments of Defense  DOD  and Veteran Affairs  VA  that would provide individualized services  improve coordination between the two agencies  require routine brain injury screening tests for military personnel  increase TBI patient benefits  improve case oversight and expand TBI research in the Defense Department and the VA      Too many of our brave service men and women are coming home from war with serious injuries that may be overlooked because they don   t bear any visible wounds or scars     Durbin said     We owe them the best treatment and support  while learning more about these injuries and their treatment   With that knowledge  we can moderate the impact TBI has on the lives of our veterans and their families       Last year  Senator Durbin introduced an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization bill that allocated an additional  12 million to the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center  providing the center a total of  19 million for Fiscal Year 2007  That authorization was included in the Omnibus Appropriations bill this January  at Senator Durbin   s urging  That amendment as well as this bill has been endorsed by Veterans for America    Joining Durbin as cosponsors of the bill are Senators John Warner  R VA   Patty Murray  D WA   Lindsey Graham  R SC   Barack Obama  D IL   James Webb  D VA  and Maria Cantwell  D WA    Senator Patty Murray  D WA   an original cosponsor of the bill said    TBI has clearly emerged as the signature injury of the War in Iraq  Unfortunately  the response to treating and understanding it has lagged  leaving our veterans and their families searching for answers  This bill makes TBI research  benefits  and coordination top priorities at the DOD and VA  It also requires routine screening   a critical step toward ensuring that service members with TBI don   t slip through the cracks          Troubling recent reports have made clear that a high percentage of service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from mental health problems and traumatic brain injuries  to say nothing of those who are going undiagnosed and falling through the cracks     said Senator Obama      As we prepare our nation to assist the generation of service members returning home from war  we must implement comprehensive reforms that provide early detection  treatment and counseling for those with traumatic brain injuries   Providing the best treatment for our service members is one thing about this war we can still get right     Durbin   s bill addresses the following issues  Standard of Care   The act will establish a Traumatic Brain Injury Program  run by DOD and the VA  to provide treatment and rehabilitation to service members and veterans who have suffered a service connected traumatic brain injury   It will provide a clear standard ensuring that every service member and veteran suffering a traumatic brain injury will receive the services that best meet their individual needs   Screening   DOD will be required to develop and administer a standardized cognitive pre test to be administered to all military personnel prior to deployment and upon return from deployment to determine if possible brain injury exists   The act will also require DOD and the VA to conduct outreach to advise service members and veterans about the TBI Program  their rights and responsibilities  treatment and rehabilitation options and the availability of screening   Case Management and Health Care Services   Inefficiencies in case management as well as the complex nature of care required by TBI patients has led to patient and family confusion  contradictory guidance and treatment  and a number of instances in which patients did not receive proper care   This act directs DOD and the VA to assign each patient a lead case manager to ease the stress on patient and family  facilitate navigation through the DoD and VA systems  ensure adequate care is being provided  prevent duplication of efforts  and avoid contradictory guidance   Additionally  DOD and the VA must assign each patient a lead primary care physician to coordinate and oversee the care provided to the participant  including all treatment  rehabilitation  and medications   Overlap of Benefits   To ensure members receive the best care and rehabilitation available  all participants enrolled in the program shall  for the first two years  receive any of the benefits available to veterans and to active duty members  regardless of their active duty status   Patients    Rights     DOD and the VA must also make available an appeals process to challenge any failure to provide the standard of care required in the TBI Program  They must also provide a referral to a medical professional outside of the DOD and VA when requested by a TBI patient   Traumatic brain injury is the signature injury of the Iraq war  The widespread use of improvised explosive devices  IED   s  has created thousands of TBI victims  sometimes with no other visible signs of injury  The concussions from IED explosion cause sudden  violent head movements which often lead to a TBI  With symptoms similar to that of shaken baby syndrome  TBI   s are difficult to diagnose  Injured service members may suffer from headaches  confusion  dizziness and lightheadedness in mild cases  to mood changes  loss of memory  convulsions  weakness or numbness in the extremities  and loss of coordination in more severe cases

  Senators Introduce Bill to Provide Housing for Homeless Veterans   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senators Introduce Bill to Provide Housing for Homeless Veterans Tuesday  April 10  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt Homes for Heroes Act would provide support to nation   s 200 000 veterans in need WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  was today joined by Senators Charles Schumer  D NY   Robert Menendez  D NJ   and Sherrod Brown  D OH  in introducing the Homes for Heroes Act  a bill that would expand housing and rental assistance for homeless veterans   The Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  estimates that approximately 200 000 adult veterans live on the streets or in shelters on any given day  and nearly twice as many are homeless at some point during the year       As we work to end the war in Iraq  we must also prepare to deal with the generation of service members returning home from war     said Senator Obama      As long as there are veterans or veteran family members searching for shelter on the streets  and as long as there are wounded service members receiving substandard medical care  we have failed in our duty to honor the commitment of the brave men and women who chose to serve   We must provide our returning heroes and their families with every resource they need to rebuild their lives          As we   ve seen at Walter Reed and elsewhere  our veterans returning from war have not received the help and resources they deserve     said Senator Schumer      The thousands of homeless veterans are just another stark example of how the Administration has let our veterans down  This bill will right this wrong by providing the men and women who have served our country with housing assistance   Too many veterans need a roof over their heads and it   s time we provide it now      Senator Robert Menendez said     A grateful nation should work to ensure that the men and women who risked their lives serving their country are not left stranded when they fall on hard times back home  Just as we have acted to improve health care for injured veterans  we should act to make sure veterans can put a roof over their heads          There are more than 2 000 homeless veterans in Ohio  They fought for us  We should fight for them  That s what this bill is about  and I am proud to support it     Senator Brown said   The    Homes for Heroes Act    will address these concerns by   I  Establishing Permanent Housing and Services for Low Income Veterans   Families The bill would expand the supply of permanent affordable housing for low income veteran families  This would not only provide shelter for homeless veteran families  but also help prevent low income families from falling into homelessness   The bill establishes a  225 million assistance program for community and nonprofit organizations to purchase  build or rehabilitate housing for low income veterans    The organizations would also coordinate with the VA and HUD to provide supportive services including substance abuse and mental health counseling  vocational and employment training  transportation  child care and other services to help veterans live independently   Tenants would pay a certain percentage of their income as rent   II  Expanding Rental Assistance The legislation would expand the highly successful HUD Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing  HUD VASH  Program  authorizing 20 000 vouchers annually and making the program permanent   The current authorization expires at the end of 2011 and only provides a small fraction of the vouchers needed to meet demand  currently  only 2 500 are authorized in FY 2011    This program provides permanent housing subsidies and case management services to homeless veterans with mental and addictive disorders   The VA and HUD coordinate to screen and provide services for recipients  III  Focusing Government Resources on Homeless Veterans The bill would establish the position of Special Assistant for Veterans Affairs within the Department of Housing and Urban Development to coordinate services to homeless veterans and serve as a liaison to the Department of Veterans Affairs  state and local officials and nonprofit service organizations  The bill also places additional priority on veterans by requiring all local public housing agencies to come up with plans to address the needs of homeless veterans as part of their five year comprehensive housing affordability strategy submitted to HUD    The bill also calls for comprehensive reports to Congress on the housing needs of homeless veterans and the steps the government is taking to address them   IV  Exclusion of Veterans Benefits from Rent Considerations The bill would prohibit benefits received by any member of a family from the VA from being included as income for the purposes of determining the amount of rent paid by a family for occupancy of a dwelling unit assisted under a federally assisted housing program  or in housing assisted under a federally assisted housing program  V  Assistance to Housing Service Providers The bill authorizes  1 million in grants for assistance to service providers during the application process and to assist with the execution of their projects  Senator Obama has also sponsored the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act  S  713  and the Lane Evans Mental Health Veterans Health and Benefits Improvement Act  S  117  to reform medical treatment for soldiers and veterans                                    ,Obama

have introduced the Global Poverty Act  S 2433   which requires the President to develop and implement a comprehensive policy to cut extreme global poverty in half by 2015 through aid  trade  debt relief  and coordination with the international community  businesses and NGOs   Representatives Adam Smith  D WA  and Spencer Bachus  R AL  sponsored the House version of the bill  H R  1302   which passed the House in September       Eliminating global poverty remains one of the greatest challenges we face  with billions of people around the world forced to live on just dollars a day     said Senator Obama      We can     and must     make it a priority of our foreign policy to commit to eliminating extreme poverty and ensuring every child has food  shelter  and clean drinking water   As we strive to rebuild America   s standing in the world  this legislation will not only commit to reducing global poverty  but will also demonstrate our promise and support to those in the developing world   Our commitment to the global economy has to extend beyond trade agreements that are more about increasing corporate profits than about helping workers and small farmers everywhere        Poverty  hunger  and disease will be among the most serious challenges confronting the world in the 21st century     Senator Hagel said      This legislation provides the President of the United States the framework and resources to help implement a comprehensive policy to reduce global poverty   It is the human condition that has always driven the great events of history   This is a responsibility of all citizens of the world      America needs to do more to help the 1 1 billion men  women and children throughout the world living on less than  1 a day by helping promote sustainable economic growth and development   said Senator Cantwell   We need to do more to save lives in the poorest countries  The U S  needs to implement a real plan to combat poverty on a global scale while also addressing the national security risks extreme poverty creates      Arguably no greater problem faces the world than global poverty  Nearly 2 7 billion people live on less than  2 a day and close to a billion people live on less than  1 a day   We have a moral obligation to craft an overall U S  strategy to decrease global poverty and eliminate extreme global poverty   After introducing this measure in the House for the past several years  I was pleased to see it pass this year with overwhelming bipartisan support   This bill   s Senate introduction is a significant step toward it becoming law     Representative Adam Smith said  For years  America has committed to improving the lives of the world   s poorest people   In 2000  the U S  joined more than 180 countries at the United Nations Millennium Summit and vowed to reduce global poverty by 2015   We are halfway towards this deadline  and it is time the United States makes it a priority of our foreign policy to meet this goal and help those who are struggling day to day   The Global Poverty Act  Declares it official U S  policy to promote the reduction of global poverty  the elimination of extreme global poverty  and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal of cutting extreme global poverty in half by 2015  Requires the President to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to carry out that policy   Includes guidelines for what the strategy should include   from aid  trade  and debt relief  to working with the international community  businesses and NGOs  to ensuring environmental sustainability   Requires that the President   s strategy include specific and measurable goals  efforts to be undertaken  benchmarks  and timetables   Requires the President to report back to Congress on progress made in the implementation of the global poverty strategy  This legislation is supported by a broad range of groups  including Bread for the World  CARE  Oxfam America  Habitat

         WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today wrote to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressing his concerns about the growing number of systematic sexual assaults against women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  DRC  since armed conflicts erupted again there six weeks ago  Obama asked Secretary Rice to answer a series of questions about the situation in the DRC and what the United States government is doing to help curb this violence against women  In December of 2005  Obama introduced The Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief  Security and Democracy Promotion Act  which identifies such systematic sexual violence as a particular threat in Congo  The legislation was signed into law on December 22  2006    Below is a copy of the letter  October 10  2007    The Honorable Condoleezza Rice   Secretary of State  Department of State  Washington  D C  20520   Dear Secretary Rice     I am writing to express my concern about the escalation of sexual violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo  DRC  since armed conflicts erupted again there six weeks ago      The violence has been marked  in particular  by systematic sexual assaults against women   In 2004  Amnesty International estimated that at least 40 000 women and girls were systematically raped and tortured in the DRC since 1998   In 2006  the United Nations reported 27 000 sexual assaults against women and girls in South Kivu province alone   Human Rights Watch has documented cases of rape victims as young as three years old   The New York Times recently reported that  in one town in the DRC  70 percent of Congolese women reported being sexually brutalized   The perpetrators     including disgruntled government soldiers  homegrown militia groups  and former Hutu militiamen who fled into Congo s forests after participating in the 1994 Rwandan genocide     have sustained their armed conflicts by exploiting the country s natural resources  raiding villages and committing violent atrocities    The Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief  Security and Democracy Promotion Act  which I introduced in December 2005 and which was signed into law by President Bush on December 22  2006  identifies such systematic sexual violence as a particular threat in Congo   That law states  in part  that U S  policy shall be to     urge the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to recognize and act upon its responsibilities to immediately bring discipline to its security forces  hold those individuals responsible for atrocities and other human rights violations  particularly the rape of women and girls as an act of war  accountable and bring such individuals to justice        help halt the high prevalence of sexual abuse and violence perpetrated against women and children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and mitigate the detrimental effects from acts of this type of violence by undertaking a number of health  education  and psycho social support programs        work aggressively on a bilateral basis to urge governments of countries contributing troops to the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  MONUC  to enact and enforce laws on trafficking in persons and sexual abuse that meet international standards  promote codes of conduct for troops serving as part of United Nations peacekeeping missions  and immediately investigate and punish citizens who are responsible for abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo       In that regard  I ask that you provide responses to the following questions     1     Do you have reason to believe that any DRC armed forces have been involved in mass rapes in the eastern DRC during the recent violence      2     What mechanisms exist to investigate and report on allegations of such violence     3     What  if any  investigations have been undertaken  and what have been the results of such investigations      4     To date  have any individuals been held accountable for such violence     5     What is the nature of U S  support for efforts to build the new Congolese armed forces and what elements of that support  if any  raise awareness about the importance of this issue of sexual violence      6     Is any U S  support contingent on the DRC government taking steps to address this issue     7     What steps  if any  is the U S  taking diplomatically to develop a consensus position among all donors contributing to the rebuilding of the Congolese armed force about the importance of addressing sexual violence     8     What resources has the United States government dedicated to victims of sexual violence over the course of the last six years     9     How is the U S  ensuring that the UN  and all countries that contribute troops to MONUC  are abiding by codes of conduct for the prevention of sexual abuse and trafficking     I thank you in advance for the consideration of these questions  and I look forward to your prompt reply    Sincerely     Barack Obama   United States Senator                                  ,Obama

               Obama Calls for Investigation into Violations by Private Medicare Insurers Wednesday  October 10  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511  Requests additional oversight  answers from GAO   WASHINGTON  DC     Today  U S  Senator Barack Obama called on the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to open an investigation into Medicare Advantage programs    Recent reports have exposed cases of private insurers exploiting America s seniors by denying access to needed health care services and medications  improperly denying claims  engaging in deceptive sales practices  and providing poor customer service    Below is the text of Senator Obama s letter    October 8  2007   The Honorable David M  Walker   Comptroller General  U S  Government Accountability Office   441 G Street  NW  Washington  DC 20548    Dear Mr  Walker    I am writing to request that the Government Accountability Office  GAO  immediately open an investigation into the exploitation of senior citizens by private insurers participating in the Medicare Advantage program     According to an analysis by the New York Times  tens of thousands of Medicare recipients have been the victims of deceptive sales practices by these private insurance companies  had claims improperly denied or denied without explanation  and received poor customer service in trying to get their questions answered   In some cases  the practices of these companies were found to have affected the health of patients by delaying access to urgently needed health care services and medications      Medicare has been a successful program for four decades  in part because it has been free of such practices   And if this is the price of introducing private insurers into the system  the cost for America and our senior citizens is too high    Among the examples of problems identified by these audits were    UnitedHealth and Humana denied claims without giving any explanation to beneficiaries   WellPoint had a backlog of 354 000 claims  its call center required an average of 27 minutes to answer phone calls from beneficiaries and 16 minutes to answer calls from providers  and more than half of the callers hung up without speaking to a customer service representative   Sierra Health Services stopped drug coverage for 2 300 beneficiaries with HIV AIDS when the company mistakenly thought that the beneficiaries had not paid their premiums   and  Humana had so many complaints about its marketing practices that it could not investigate all of them     Other news stories in recent months have detailed how insurance companies aggressively market private Medicare plans to seniors   in some cases even forging their signatures and providing false information   What is particularly egregious is that these private plans receive higher subsidies for services than under traditional Medicare   The Medicare Payment Admission Commission recently reported that on average the government pays 12 percent more to private Medicare plans than it costs to treat comparable beneficiaries through traditional Medicare   These excessive subsidies cost the government billions of dollars every year    Given the popularity of Medicare Advantage plans     enrollment has increased to 8 7 million from 5 3 million in 2003     it is important to ensure these companies are providing the services for which they are reimbursed   This year  the federal government will pay private insurers  76 3 billion for participating in the Medicare Advantage program   I am pleased that GAO has already started this oversight process as evidenced by a July 2007 report finding that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services was not complying with a requirement that it audit the financial records of one third of participating companies      However  I believe that GAO needs to conduct additional oversight into how America  s senior citizens are treated by these private companies   Specifically  I believe that GAO should open an investigation into the following    The extent of deceptive practices in the marketing of Medicare Advantage programs   Whether beneficiaries are wrongly being denied needed health care services and medications   Whether the claims of beneficiaries are being improperly denied or denied without sufficient explanation  The speed with which appeals of claims denials are considered   Whether customer service representatives are responsive to the questions and concerns of beneficiaries  and  Whether additional safeguards are necessary to protect beneficiaries     Given the seriousness of this issue and its effect on America  s senior citizens  I appreciate your prompt attention to this request   Thank you    Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator                                  ,Obama

  WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urging her to consider  in light of the State Department   s support for France   s extradition request for Manuel Noriega  to publicly request that the Government of France extradite Hans Peterson  an American citizen who reportedly confessed to the 2006 murder of Dr  David Cornbleet in Chicago     In today   s letter  the Senators note that     The State Department has publicly expressed support for France   s request for former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to be extradited from the United States to France to face money laundering charges   While there are certainly compelling reasons for Noriega to face justice in France  there are also compelling reasons for Hans Peterson to face justice in the United States  We therefore ask that the State Department immediately make a direct appeal to the Government of France to extradite Hans Peterson to face charges in Cook County  Illinois for the murder of Dr  Cornbleet          Earlier this month  Peterson turned himself in to French authorities in St  Martin and reportedly confessed to the brutal murder of Dr  Cornbleet  a Chicago dermatologist   Peterson is currently in French custody in Guadeloupe   According to reports  Peterson  whose mother is French  fled to French territory after committing the murder in an effort to avoid criminal prosecution in the United States   The U S  Department of Justice Office of International Affairs has issued a formal request to the Government of France for Peterson   s extradition     On August 23  France announced its decision not to extradite Peterson  While the extradition treaty between the United States and France says that there is    no obligation upon the requested state to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the requested state     this treaty does not preclude France from exercising its discretion to extradite one of its nationals to the U S       Last week  Durbin met with the newly appointed French Ambassador  Pierre Vimont  and the French Charg   d   Affaires  Fran  ois Rivasseau  to urge France to reconsider its decision not to extradite Hans Peterson   On August 27  Durbin and Senator Obama sent a letter to the French Foreign Minister  Bernard Kouchner  urging France to reconsider its decision    On August 20  Durbin and Obama sent a letter to Charg   d   Affaires Rivasseau at the French Embassy in Washington  DC  urging the Government of France to agree to the United States    request for Peterson   s extradition to face criminal prosecution for Dr  Cornbleet   s murder   The Illinois Senators also sent a letter on August 20 to Secretary of State Rice  requesting that she immediately urge her French counterparts to examine the extradition request and to advise the U S  Embassy in Paris of the importance of this case    text of the letter is below    September 11  2007 Dr  Condoleezza Rice  Secretary of State  U S  Department of State  2201 C Street NW  Washington  DC 20520 Madam Secretary   We write to seek your urgent assistance with regard to the pending extradition request in the case of murdered Illinois doctor David Cornbleet   This letter follows up on our letter to you of August 20  to which we have not yet received a response   In light of the time  sensitive nature of this matter  we request that you respond to this letter as soon as possible and no later than one week from today      Dr  Cornbleet  a respected and beloved doctor from Chicago  was brutally stabbed to death on October 24  2006   In August 2007  Hans Peterson  an American citizen with dual French nationality  turned himself in to French authorities in the French West Indies and confessed to Dr  Cornbleet   s murder   Peterson is currently in French custody in Guadeloupe   The United States Department of Justice Office of International Affairs has issued a formal request to the Government of France for the extradition of Peterson to face criminal prosecution for Dr  Cornbleet s murder  and we have contacted you and the French government to express our strong support for that request    However  the French government has said that France will not extradite Peterson  and that Peterson will be tried under the French justice system    We note that the State Department has publicly expressed support for France   s request for former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to be extradited from the United States to France to face money laundering charges   While there are certainly compelling reasons for Noriega to face justice in France  there are also compelling reasons for Hans Peterson to face justice in the United States   We therefore ask that the State Department immediately make a direct appeal to the Government of France to extradite Hans Peterson to face charges in Cook County  Illinois for the murder of Dr  Cornbleet    We believe the specific facts of this case justify Peterson   s extradition to the United States   Dr  Cornbleet s murder was unspeakable in its brutality  and Dr  Cornbleet s family  the people of Illinois  and the United States criminal justice system have a strong and compelling interest in seeing Dr  Cornbleet   s confessed murderer face trial in the United States   Hans Peterson was born in Oregon in 1978  and for the first 28 years of his life he lived in the United States and availed himself of the rights and privileges of U S  citizenship   Only after allegedly committing a heinous crime did Peterson flee the United States for French territory and seek the rights and privileges of French nationality in an attempt to escape criminal prosecution in the United States   There is legitimate concern that Peterson  if found guilty of murder in France  would serve a lesser sentence than he might be expected to serve if tried and convicted in the United States       The French ambassador has verbally indicated to us that Peterson cannot be extradited because French law prohibits the extradition of its nationals   However  Article 3 of the recent Extradition Treaty between the United States and France does not preclude France from extraditing one of its nationals to the United States   Moreover  the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France states that it was concluded in order    to provide for more effective cooperation between the two States in the suppression of crime and to facilitate relations between the two States in the area of extradition         That cooperation appears imminent in the case of Manuel Noriega  and would also be appropriate in the case of Hans Peterson   We have asked the Government of France to provide us with a written analysis reconciling its legal position with the plain language of the Extradition Treaty   To date  we have not received that written analysis    To the extent the Government of France has any discretion available under French law and international treaties to extradite Hans Peterson to the United States  we ask that the Government of the United States  through the State Department  urge the French government to exercise that discretion in favor of extradition    We thank you in advance for the consideration of this request  and we again request that you reply to this letter as soon as possible  and in no case later than September 18     Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin                                                            United States Senator

Renews Support for Embryonic Stem Cell Research Wednesday  April 11  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt  Says proposed alternatives are not substitutes WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama today released the following statement during the debate on the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  I stand in full support of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act as I did when this bill was introduced and sent to the President   s desk in the 109th Congress   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill   I am frustrated by the opposition this bill has generated and saddened that we are preventing the advancement of important science that could potentially impact millions of suffering Americans   The study of stem cells holds enormous promise for the treatment of debilitating and life threatening diseases   However  in order to reach this level of medical achievement  much more research is necessary to understand  and eventually harness  the amazing potential of stem cells   Instead of creating roadblocks  we must all work together to expand federal funding of stem cell research and continue moving forward in our fight against disease by advancing our knowledge through science and medicine   Each year  100 000 Americans will develop Alzheimer   s disease  with impaired memory  ability to understand  and judgment    Over 1 million adults will be diagnosed with diabetes this year  and risk complications that include blindness  damaged nerves and loss of kidney function   We all know or have met individuals with spinal cord injuries  including national celebrities  local war heroes and loved ones from our own families and circles of friends  who are struggling to maintain mobility and independence   For most of our history  medicine has offered little hope of recovery to the 100 million individuals affected by these and other devastating illnesses and injuries   Until now   Recent developments in stem cell research may hold the key to improved treatments  if not cures  for those affected by Alzheimer s disease  diabetes  spinal cord injury and countless other conditions   Many men  women  and children who are cancer survivors are already familiar with the life saving applications of adult stem cell research   Patients with leukemia or lymphoma often undergo bone marrow transplants  a type of stem cell transplant  which can significantly prolong life  or permanently get rid of the cancer   This therapy has been used successfully for decades  and is saving lives everyday   Yet this breakthrough has its serious limitations  Adult stem cells  such as those used in bone marrow transplants  can only be collected in small quantities  may not be a match for the patient  which can lead to rejection  and have limited ability to differentiate  or transform into specialized cells   Similarly  the promising advances of stem cell use from a patient   s own cord blood  as illustrated by the success stories of Dr  Joanne Kurtzberg from Duke University  also have their limitations   If  for example  a young cord blood recipient   s condition should deteriorate after his or her initial treatment  or should develop another illness  there simply are not enough cord blood cells left for a second use    The few remaining cells would have to be cloned to get enough cells for future treatment  or stem cells would have to be obtained from another source   Two of my constituents  Mary Schneider and her son Ryan  are well aware of the potential of cord blood treatments   Her son  diagnosed with cerebral palsy at 2 years of age  has made what appears to be a full recovery after treatment with his own cord blood   Despite the compelling results witnessed by the Schneider family  they also firmly believe and support expanded research of embryonic stem cells to combat disease   A recent scientific paper about stem cells derived from amniotic fluid has drawn much attention   While this offers an exciting alternative to regenerative medicine therapies  the author of that report  Dr  Anthony Atala  has himself urged that his work on amniotic stem cells will not replace the continued need for investigation into treatments with stem cells derived from embryos   All of these alternative treatments are just that  alternatives  and are not substitutes for embryonic stem cell research   Embryonic stem cells can be obtained from a number of sources  including in vitro fertilization   At this very moment  there are over 400 000 embryos being stored in over 400 facilities throughout the United States  The majority of these are reserved for infertile couples  However  many of these embryos will go unused  destined for permanent storage in a freezer or disposal    We should expand and accelerate research using these embryos  just as we should continue to explore the viability of adult stem cell use  cord blood use  and amniotic fluid use   The promise of embryonic stem cells has come to light in a recent achievement by researchers at Johns Hopkins   They were able to repair damaged nerves and restore mobility in paralyzed rats through embryonic stem cells   One can   t help but wonder when  not if  this research will be translated into techniques that will help human patients who have lost the ability to walk   Of course any work in this area must have appropriate oversight  Embryonic stem cell research demands comprehensive  thoughtful and carefully crafted ethical and scientific guidelines  We must not only look to guidance from the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration but also to our reason  our morals and our compassion   The President   s veto of the stem cell bill proposed in the last Congress prevents government funding beyond 78 previously established stem cell lines   However  recent estimates on the number of viable cell lines bring the numbers down closer to 20   Clearly  we are moving backwards in our efforts with these current restrictions   Stymieing embryonic stem cell research is a step in the wrong direction   It closes the door on many Americans awaiting new treatments that could potentially provide a better quality of life  or  perhaps  even save their life   My hope  and the hope of so many in this country  is to provide our researchers with the means to explore the uses of embryonic stem cells so that we can begin to turn the tide on the devastating diseases affecting our nation and the world                                   ,Obama

Review for Poor Performance  WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Tom Harkin  D IA   Edward Kennedy  D MA   and Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent the following letter to Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt  calling on him to immediately release a list of 128 nursing homes that are being scrutinized for providing poor care   According to press accounts  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  identified these facilities because of their history of consistent violations of health and safety regulations  such as improper medical care  preventable falls and accidents  serious neglect  and physical abuse   To date  the Department has identified only 54 of these facilities  refusing to disclose the names of the other 74 facilities  thereby potentially endangering the health and safety of thousands of our most vulnerable citizens   Senators Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Joseph Lieberman  ID CT   Evan Bayh  D IN   Bernard Sanders  I VT   Ron Wyden  D OR  also signed the letter    In the letter  the nine senators also called on Leavitt to provide clear guidance to state nursing home inspection agencies as to whether they are permitted to release such information to the public   Last week  Obama sent a similar letter to Leavitt  vowing to pursue legislative action if this information is not released  Obama has not yet received a response to that letter  The text of the letter is below  Dear Secretary Leavitt  We are writing to express our serious objections to the withholding of critical information about nursing home conditions from America   s senior citizens  An estimated 1 5 million residents live in approximately 16 000 nursing homes in the United States   This year  federal  state  and local governments will spend  82 billion on nursing home care  of which  56 5 billion will come from the federal government through Medicare and Medicaid   All nursing homes that receive federal funding are subject to federal regulation and annual inspections   Under federal law  these inspections are a matter of public record and are made available to nursing home residents and their family members  and summaries of the inspection reports are posted on your department   s Nursing Home Compare website  www medicare gov NHCompare   These federal inspection and public disclosure requirements ensure that nursing home residents are receiving the high quality of care that they deserve   Given the importance of protecting one of our nation   s most vulnerable populations  we were disturbed to learn that your department is withholding information about some of the worst performing nursing homes in the country    According to press accounts  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  has compiled a list of 128    special focus facilities    that are among the worst performing nursing homes in the country   These facilities are ones that have consistently been cited for serious violations of health and safety regulations     violations such as improper medical care  preventable falls and accidents  pressure sores  serious neglect  and physical abuse   If these violations are not corrected  the facility could be subject to penalties and termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs    However  of the 128 worst performing facilities  only 54 of these nursing homes have been publicly identified   The remaining 74 facilities have not been disclosed to the public  even though this information would be invaluable not only to current residents of those facilities but also to potential residents and their family members   It is incomprehensible why the complete list of 128 facilities     which is determined on the basis of publicly available inspection reports     would not be made public  Although the names of the 128    special focus facilities    have not been made available to the public  press accounts suggest that the complete list has been provided to the American Health Care Association  the main lobbying organization for the nursing home industry   Providing information about poorly performing nursing homes to the lobbyists who represent those facilities  and not to the senior citizens who would most benefit from this information  is outrageous  There is also some uncertainty among state inspection agencies as to whether states have the right to release the names of the previously undisclosed    special focus facilities      Following recent press stories  the Iowa inspection agency released the names of the five Iowa facilities on the list  yet Texas officials have said they cannot release this information without permission from CMS    Accordingly  we call on you to immediately release the names of all 128    special focus facilities    or at the very least  provide clear guidance to state nursing home inspection agencies that they are permitted to release such information to the public   Thank you  Sincerely  Barack

 Ben LaBolt  WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved his funding requests for strengthening Illinois    transportation infrastructure and expanding community center services       Illinois is one step closer to the funding it needs to fix our roads  fight congestion  and restore hiking and biking trails across the state     said Senator Obama      Metra is the largest commuter rail system in the country  and this will help to make up for the funding shortfalls which have threatened to limit service around Chicago   This bill will also fund a frontline health care program that will bring treatment directly to children in underserved communities who suffer from asthma   I am also pleased to have secured funding to modernize Rock Island   s Martin Luther King Jr  Community Center to expand peer counseling and educational programs  which will give children in the Quad Cities an extra boost on their

the Grand Avenue Underpass allows for the constant flow of traffic under the new combined rail line    3 000 000 to the Illinois Department of Transportation to improve trails across Illinois   Senator Obama worked with Senator Durbin to provide  3 000 000 to the Illinois Department of Transportation to improve trails across the state of Illinois   This funding will be used to improve bike and pedestrian friendly trails across the state of Illinois   These trails will benefit our communities and individuals by reducing harmful emissions  reducing congestion  reducing petroleum

improve service  Metra is the largest commuter rail system in the country in terms of number of lines  total track miles  and numbers of cars and locomotives  Funding will support environmental assessments and preliminary engineering which will establish a key rail connection throughout the northwest  west  and southwest suburbs and also offer the basis for expanded suburban rail service in the future and provide new service and stations for Chicago s south suburbs  Senator Obama secured these funds with Senator Durbin    300 000 to the Mobile C A R E  Foundation in Chicago  for the acquisition and operation of Asthma Vans  Mobile C A R E  provides free and comprehensive asthma care and health education to children in Chicago s underserved communities via mobile medical clinics  the Asthma Vans  Asthma is a growing burden on Chicago  A recent study by the University of Illinois at Chicago reports that 16  of non Hispanic Black children and 20  of Puerto Rican children in

                                                                     Obama  Bond  Boxer  McCaskill  Murray  Lieberman Introduce Amendment to Temporarily Cease Military Personality Disorder Discharges Thursday  July 12  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      CONTACT  Ben LaBolt      Legislation calls for moratorium until comprehensive review of personality disorder discharge procedures WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Christopher Bond  R MO   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Joseph Lieberman  I CT   Claire McCaskill  D MO   and Patty Murray  D WA  today introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would temporarily suspend the Pentagon   s use of personality disorder discharges for those service members who have served in combat until there is a comprehensive review of the current procedures and an establishment of an independent discharge review board   Recent reports suggest the Department of Defense  DOD  has inappropriately and inconsistently used personality disorder discharges to swiftly discharge members of the armed forces with service connected injuries such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  and Traumatic Brain Injuries  TBIs     Such discharges can result in the loss of needed healthcare benefits from the VA as well as the repayment of enlistment bonuses  which can send injured service members and their families into debilitating debt     Given the thousands of American service members currently suffering from service connected psychological injuries  reports that the Department of Defense may be improperly diagnosing service members with personality disorders are deeply troubling     said Senator Obama      Given the lasting consequences of a personality disorder discharge  even one misdiagnosis is one too many   This amendment will force the Department of Defense to suspend its use of this discharge procedure until Secretary Gates can conduct a comprehensive review of these policies and establish a review board to ensure our service members have recourse when their cases are in doubt   It is our moral obligation to ensure that our service members receive the treatment  care  and benefits they deserve   That   s one thing about this war we can still get right         Abuse of personality disorder discharges is inexcusable   This amendment will put a stop to these discharges until we can fix the system     said Senator Bond      The men and women who put their lives on the line to defend our freedom have earned a debt of gratitude from all Americans that we will never be able to pay in full   The very least we can do is take care of their battle wounds  whether physical or mental  and ensure they receive the treatment and benefits they deserve     Senator Boxer said   It is unconscionable that some of our brave servicemen and women  including those suffering from PTSD and other mental health problems  may be receiving improper discharges for personality disorders and  in turn  denied disability benefits and guaranteed care from the Department of Veterans Affairs   This amendment halts these discharges until measures are put in place to ensure they are handled properly   We owe our brave service men and women nothing less      We have no greater obligation to those who serve our country in the Armed Services than to ensure they get the care they   ve been promised     McCaskill said     We cannot stand tall and proud as Americans if we allow one single service member to go without the benefits they deserve due to a misdiagnosis  Far too many combat troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan are returning with mental health injuries that bear the potential for misdiagnosis  and we need to do all we can to prevent that from occurring        We need to take a    time out    on these discharges and get the facts  We need ensure these discharges are medically accurate and that service members are not being denied the treatment or benefits they deserve     Senator Murray said  This amendment mandates a temporary moratorium on personality disorder discharges until the Department of Defense conducts a proper review and revision of its current policies and procedures related to this diagnosis   It also gives the DOD flexibility by granting an exception to the moratorium in those cases in which a service member provides false or misleading information  or omits information about past criminal behavior during the recruitment or enlistment process   The moratorium would be lifted after the DOD reviews its current policies  ensures it is following standard clinical diagnostic practices  and has established an independent review board to ensure that service members who have received this diagnosis may seek a review  On June 21  2007  Senators Bond  Boxer  Obama  Lieberman  McCaskill  Murray  and twenty five other Democratic and Republican senators wrote to Secretary Gates to express concern over continuing reports that personality disorder discharges were being implemented improperly  Over the last six years  Defense Department records indicate that over 22 500 personality disorder discharges have been processed  or on average 10 service members have been discharged per day  every day in that time                                   ,Obama

Papas Call on Indiana Governor  US EPA  and Regional EPA to work with US Steel to protect Lake Michigan  WASHINGTON  D C      Continuing their effort to fight for the environmental health and protection of Lake Michigan  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Congressman Rahm Emanuel  D IL  today  along with Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and members of the Chicago delegation  sent a letter to U S  Steel Corporation  calling for a meeting with the Chairman and CEO to discuss Indiana Department of Environmental Management   s  IDEM  proposal to give U S  Steel Corporation   s Gary Works facility in Gary  Indiana a wastewater permit that would allow them to operate for five more years without complying with current clean water standards      Durbin and Emanuel also sent letters to both the EPA Administrator  and the Region 5 EPA office commending them for coming out in opposition to the permit and asking them to work with IDEM and U S  Steel to right the situation   They sent a fourth letter to the Governor of Indiana asking for his cooperation    In today s letter to U S  Steel the members wrote     Lake Michigan is our Grand Canyon  our Yellowstone  and we hope that you will join us in working to protect the lake   It is our understanding that US Steel has been working to come into compliance with clean water requirements at the Gary  Indiana facility for over a decade   We strongly oppose any efforts that might lead to an increase in the pollutants the Gary Works discharges into the Grand Calumet River  which feeds into Lake Michigan      According to an article in today   s Chicago Tribune  Gary Works  located about 15 miles southeast of Chicago  is the largest source of water pollution in the Lake Michigan basin  dumping more than 1 7 million pounds in 2005   The facility has been operating under an expired permit that has been extended by state officials since 1994   The proposed permit would allow Gary Works to increase its discharge of pollutants  including oil lead  arsenic  benzene  and nitrates  into the Grand Calumet River  which flows directly into Lake Michigan   Additionally  the permit would grant U S  Steel an additional 5 years to meet federal standards for several other pollutants  most notably ammonia and mercury  Senator Durbin and Congressman Emanuel sent four letters regarding the proposed IDEM permit   In a letter to the EPA Administrator  Stephen Johnson  both Illinois members applauded EPA for rejecting the proposed IDEM permit and urged them to review all proposed permits in order to ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act   Further  in their letter to the EPA Region 5 Administrator  Mary Gade  Durbin and Emanuel questioned U S  Steel   s compliance with the Clean Water Act  In their letter to the Governor of Indiana  Mitch Daniels  Durbin and Emanuel stressed that economic development and protecting the Great Lakes can and should go hand in hand   Finally  in a letter to the Chairman and

express our strong concern and request a meeting with you to discuss the potential effects of this permit on the health of Lake Michigan and all of the Great Lakes  The Great Lakes account for 95  of

concerned local citizens  BP reconsidered their decision to increase their permitted discharge levels and is now working to expand their Whiting refinery without discharging more ammonia and other pollutants into Lake Michigan   We urge you to reconsider your company   s decision to seek a permit that threatens water quality in Lake Michigan and invite you to meet with us to discuss this

makes significant strides towards minimizing pollutants      Following this latest news about IDEM   s proposed U S  Steel permit and the recent controversy over BP   s NPDES permit for their Whiting

1200 Pennsylvania Ave NW  Washington  DC 20460  Dear Administrator Johnson   We are writing to express our strong concern over the Indiana Department of Environmental Management   s proposed wastewater permit for U S  Steel Corporation   s Gary Works facility in Gary  Indiana   According to many experts  the permit would allow the Gary Works to increase the pollutants they discharge into the Grand Calumet River  including oil lead  arsenic  benzene  nitrates and more    Additionally  the permit would grant U S  Steel an additional five years to meet federal standards for several other pollutants  most notably ammonia and mercury  As such  we are relieved to hear that the EPA has formally objected to this permit  particularly with regard to the discharge limits and five year compliance schedules   A mere three months ago  we wrote to express our concern regarding IDEM   s permit for BP   s Whiting  Indiana facility   There are still unanswered questions regarding that permit and EPA   s oversight of its issuance  and we hope that the EPA will work with Indiana to make sure that permits issued by IDEM do not threaten the health of the Great Lakes   We all want to work together to protect Lake Michigan    It has come to our attention that there may be additional permits being reviewed by IDEM and we urge you to undertake a detailed review of all proposed permits to ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act and the standards of the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative  GLI    It   s time to improve rather than threaten the health of Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes  As you are well aware  President Bush issued an executive order in May of 2004 to establish a Great Lakes Interagency Task Force in order to promote a regional collaboration for the Great Lakes   In the executive order  the President stated that it    is the policy of the Federal Government to support local and regional efforts to address environmental challenges and to encourage local citizen and community stewardship      We agree with the President that the Great Lakes are among our nation   s greatest treasures  and we need to take action to protect them   We thank you for objecting to the proposed permit allowing U S  Steel to increase the pollutants they discharge into the Grand Calumet River and hope that we can work with you as you revise the permit with the state of Indiana to draft a permit consistent with the Clean Water Act  the GLI  and the goal of improving the health of the Great Lakes   Sincerely    Rahm Emanuel

Honorable Mitch Daniels  Governor   Dear Governor Daniels  After reading this morning   s Chicago Tribune article regarding the proposed wastewater permit for US Steel   s Gary  Indiana  facility  we write to express our strong concern about the potential impact of this proposal and others like it on the health of Lake Michigan   President Bush issued an executive order in May of 2004 to establish a Great Lakes Interagency Task Force to promote a regional collaboration for the Great Lakes   In the executive order  the President stated that it    is the policy of the Federal Government to support local and regional efforts to address environmental challenges and to encourage local citizen and community stewardship      The permit currently under review by the State of Indiana appears to move in the opposite direction   You sit in a unique position  with the potential to make a positive  lasting impact on the Lake   The State of Indiana can and should work with industry in the state to encourage compliance with the Clean Water Act goals and to participate as stewards of Lake Michigan     We all know how important Lake Michigan is for our states and for the country   The Great Lakes account for 95 percent of the United States    surface freshwater and provide drinking water for more than 30 million Americans   Between the startling increases in fish consumption advisories  record numbers of beach closures  and studies indicating that over 90 percent of shoreline in the Great Lakes region is polluted  Lake Michigan and the other Great Lakes need greater environmental stewardship  not greater levels of pollution    We believe that economic infrastructure and protecting the Great Lakes can and should go hand in hand   U S  Steel   s Gary Works is one of the region   s biggest employers and contributes to the supply of domestic steel   Our hope is that as U S  Steel serves these functions for our region  it also will recognize its obligation to more aggressively mitigate pollutants discharged into the public waterways   We urge the State of Indiana to reevaluate this permit  and work with the EPA and U S  Steel to protect the Lake

VA Oversight Thursday  October 11  2007  For Immediate Release   Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Amy Brundage  Obama  Inadequate background check may have put veterans at risk WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to the Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs  Gordon Mansfield asking questions regarding the background check that was performed on Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez who has been linked to some extent to the recent spike in deaths at the Marion VA Medical Center   A cursory check of publicly available information by staff members from both Senate offices uncovered questionable information that should have raised red flags and prompted additional investigation by the VA      It appears the VA   s efforts to discover the truth about Dr  Veizaga Mendez  his past professional history  and the circumstances surrounding his license forfeiture were far from adequate and may have put the veterans seeking care at Marion in danger     the Illinois Senators wrote      This is an extremely alarming revelation that calls into question the adequacy of the oversight exercised by the VA as it evaluates and monitors those who provide care to our veterans      On September 14  the Department of Veterans Affairs suspended all inpatient surgeries at the medical center due to an unusual increase in deaths   Four top hospital officials have been reassigned until an Inspector General investigation is completed   During the investigations  questions have arose about a surgeon  Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez  who was allowed to practice medicine at the facility until August 2007 despite having to surrender his license in Massachusetts after numerous cases of malpractice  In an October 3 meeting with Senator Durbin  Dr  Michael Kussman  Under Secretary of VA for Health and Dr  Gerald Cross  Principal Deputy Under Secretary insisted that the VA could not have known that Dr  Veizaga Mendez had surrendered his license under circumstances that were more troubling than the non disciplinary and voluntary conditions he claimed     Both Senators Durbin and Obama have actively pressed the VA for information on the situation at the Marion VA Medical Center   Last month  they sent a letter to Jim Nicholson  who was serving as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  asking specific questions about the VA   s response to the increase in deaths at the center   They also asked why Dr  Veizaga Mendez  who had been barred from practicing in another state  continued to practice at the Marion VA Center until August    This followed a September 17 letter to Secretary Nicholson  sent by Durbin and Obama  asking for more information on the ongoing investigation   In the letter  they also sought assurances that the travel and scheduling needs of any veterans who must now be redirected to other facilities to receive their needed surgeries will be facilitated   text of letter below and attached October 11  2007 The Honorable Gordon Mansfield  Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs  Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Ave   NW  Washington  DC 20420 Dear Secretary Mansfield  We are writing to follow up on two previous letters we sent to Secretary Nicholson last month with regard to the situation at the Marion  IL  Veterans Administration Medical Center  VAMC  and specifically on the hiring and employment of Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez   Continued revelations about Dr  Veizaga Mendez   s record both before and during his employment at the Marion VAMC have raised serious concerns about the adequacy of the VA   s credentialing and quality control systems  In our letter to Secretary Nicholson of September 24  we asked him to explain the background check process that is conducted by the VA before hiring medical staff   Additionally  specific concerns regarding Dr  Veizaga Mendez   s employment were raised directly with Undersecretary Kussman and Deputy Undersecretary Cross in a meeting last week   Dr  Kussman and Dr  Cross both insisted that the VA had conducted due diligence when it became aware that Dr  Veizaga Mendez had surrendered his medical license in Massachusetts   They asserted that there was no way the VA could have known that Dr  Veizaga Mendez had surrendered his license under circumstances that were more troubling than the non disciplinary and voluntary conditions he claimed   However  a cursory check by our staff of publicly available information has cast doubt on the validity of that claim   Although our staff did not have access to the full range of information that hospitals and state medical boards have  we were still able to uncover questionable information about Dr  Veizaga Mendez of sufficient magnitude that it should have raised red flags and prompted additional investigation before the VA continued to entrust the lives of our veterans to his care  It appears the VA   s efforts to discover the truth about Dr  Veizaga Mendez  his past professional history  and the circumstances surrounding his license forfeiture were far from adequate and may have put the veterans seeking care at Marion in danger   This is an extremely alarming revelation that calls into question the adequacy of the oversight exercised by the VA as it evaluates and monitors those who provide care to our veterans   We have specific questions regarding the background check that was performed on Dr  Veizaga Mendez and on the oversight of care givers throughout the VA Medical System      1  An October 5  2007  Associated Press article cites Pete McBrady  acting director of the Marion VAMC  as saying that the VAMC    has a board consisting of a group of practicing physicians at the hospital who vet each candidate for hire    and that    there was no evidence that would set off any alarms about Veizaga Mendez with the Marion panel when they reviewed the doctor      Prior to hiring Dr  Veizaga Mendez  what inquiries did the VAMC make to public or private sources concerning his qualifications   What specific evidence did the VAMC obtain when it reviewed Dr  Veizaga Mendez prior to his hiring   2  Did the VAMC contact the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine  Massachusetts Board  regarding Dr  Veizaga Mendez   s qualifications prior to his hiring   3  We have been informed by the Massachusetts Board that the Board operates a publicly accessible internet site featuring profiles of physicians licensed in Massachusetts   We also have been informed that when he was hired by the Marion VAMC in January 2006  Dr  Veizaga Mendez had a profile on the Massachusetts Board   s internet site that would have disclosed  at minimum  that he had been the subject of a hospital disciplinary action in 2004  and that he made two medical malpractice payments  one in 2004 and one in 2005    Did the VAMC access the Massachusetts Board   s internet profile of Dr  Veizaga Mendez before hiring him   If so  what was the VA   s response to the information contained in the profile   4  Dr  Veizaga Mendez voluntarily surrendered his Massachusetts license in July 2006   How was the VA notified he had surrendered his license  What investigation was undertaken by the VA to determine the cause and circumstances   Was the VA informed about allegations of professional misconduct against Dr  Veizaga Mendez that were made by the Massachusetts Board   5  Did Dr  Veizaga Mendez provide any written representations regarding the surrender of his Massachusetts license   If so  what were those representations   6  We have been informed that Dr  Veizaga Mendez has filed an appeal before the Massachusetts Division of Administrative Law Appeals in response to allegations raised by the Massachusetts Board   Was the VA aware of any such appeal    7  According to regulations governing the Massachusetts Board  the VA is not explicitly included on a list of    designated agencies    that are entitled to request and view non public information from the Massachusetts Board   Why is the VA not included on this list   Are there other states in which the VA is not entitled to request and review non public information from state medical licensing boards   What steps  if any  has the VA taken to address this flaw in the VA   s access to information about physicians   8  What assurances can you provide us that there are not other cases of similar circumstances at the Marion VAMC and at other VA hospitals   9  What steps are you taking to ensure that troubling information about VA physicians is not overlooked in the future   Due to the seriousness of this issue  we would appreciate a prompt response    Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin

                                    Obama Addresses Foreign Relations Committee Hearing with General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker Tuesday  September 11  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511   WASHINGTON  D C      Today  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing with General David H  Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan C  Crocker  Below is Senator Obama   s statement as prepared for delivery     Mr  Chairman  thank you for holding this hearing and for giving us an opportunity to gather more information about the situation in Iraq   I also appreciate the willingness of General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker to provide an update on the situation from their perspectives  I look forward to their assessment of the situation on the ground in Iraq  a situation that can only be described as grave        We ve heard from the Administration and from many of our Senate colleagues this summer that we need to give the President s surge strategy more time before we can make a decision to redeploy our troops   However  two reports issued over the past week paint a bleak picture of the prospects of the current strategy   These reports reinforce the conclusion that there is no military solution in Iraq  that we need to get our troops out of the middle of Iraq s civil war  and that this war must be brought to a responsible conclusion      The U S  Government Accountability Office concluded that the Iraqi government has failed to meet 11 of its 18 benchmarks   Another 4 benchmarks have been only partially met    In particular  GAO cited the failure of the Iraqi government to enact legislation on de Baathification  oil revenue sharing  provincial elections  amnesty  and militia disarmament    Moreover  according to GAO  the Iraqi government has not eliminated militia control of local security  it has not eliminated political intervention in military operations  it has not ensured even handed enforcement of the law  and it has not increased the number of army units capable of independent operations   The effect of this failure to act has been a high level of sectarian violence that can only be seen as having abated when it is measured against the explosion of violence late last year and early this year        And last week  an independent commission chaired by General James Jones offered a similarly bleak assessment   The Jones Commission found that the Iraqi Security Forces will not be able to carry out their essential security responsibilities without assistance for at least 12 to 18 months    The Commission also found that the Iraqi Police Service is incapable of providing adequate security to protect Iraqis from insurgents and sectarian violence and that the National Police is so infiltrated by sectarian militias that it should be disbanded and reorganized      These independent assessments     and the stunningly bleak NIE released at the end of last month     make clear that there has been zero national political progress   The consensus from the NIE  GAO  and General Jones is that the Iraqi Security Forces have made little progress        Rather than identify the very limited tactical gains that have been made at great cost and using them to justify the maintenance of a failing strategy  I believe it is time to change course   Over 3 700 American servicemen and women have died in this war and over 27 000 have been seriously wounded   Each month  this misguided war costs us a staggering  10 billion  and when all is said and done  this will have cost us  1 trillion      Changing the definition of success to stay the course with the wrong policy is the wrong course for our troops and our national security   The time to end the surge and to start bringing our troops home is now     not six months from now   The Iraqi government is not achieving the political progress that was the stated purpose of the surge  and in key areas has gone backwards      Our military cannot sustain its current deployments without crippling our ability to respond to contingencies around the world   It s time for a change of direction that brings our troops home  applies real pressure on the Iraqis to act  surges our diplomacy  and addresses Iraq s urgent humanitarian crisis   I can only support a policy that begins an immediate removal of our troops from Iraq s civil war  and initiates a sustained drawdown of our military presence        It is long past time to turn the page in Iraq  where each day we see the consequences of fighting a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged    We in Congress must take action to change the President s failed policy                                        ,Obama

Obama  D IL   Chuck Hagel  R NE   and Maria Cantwell  D WA  and Congressman Adam Smith  D WA  today hailed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee s passage of the Global Poverty Act  S 2433   which requires the President to develop and implement a comprehensive policy to cut extreme global poverty in half by 2015 through aid  trade  debt relief  and coordination with the international community  businesses and NGOs  This legislation was introduced in December   Smith and Congressman Spencer Bachus  R AL  sponsored the House version of the bill  H R  1302   which passed the House last September    With billions of people living on just dollars a day around the world  global poverty remains one of the greatest challenges and tragedies the international community faces   said Senator Obama   It must be a priority of American foreign policy to commit to eliminating extreme poverty and ensuring every child has food  shelter  and clean drinking water  As we strive to rebuild America s standing in the world  this important bill will demonstrate our promise and commitment to those in the developing world   Our commitment to the global economy must extend beyond trade agreements that are more about increasing corporate profits than about helping workers and small farmers everywhere  I commend Chairman Biden and Ranking Member Lugar for supporting this bill and moving it forward quickly    Poverty  hunger  and disease will be among the most serious challenges confronting the world in the 21st century   Senator Hagel said    This legislation provides the President of the United States the framework and resources to help implement a comprehensive policy to reduce global poverty   It is the human condition that has always driven the great events of history   This is a responsibility of all citizens of the world    Global poverty directly impacts our national security  We must rally private sector and government resources to eliminate extreme global poverty and to fight global disease   said Senator Cantwell    With more than 1 1 billion men  women and children throughout the world living on less than  1 a day  it is of the utmost importance to make sure these people get the help they need and push for sustainable economic growth  We need to do more to save lives in the poorest countries and extend our hand to people in need      Global poverty is one of the greatest moral and security challenges facing the world today  Nearly 2 7 billion people live on less than  2 a day and close to a billion live on less than  1 a day   This bill represents a major advance in our effort to address global poverty   After introducing this measure in the House for the past several years  I am pleased to see the Senate Foreign Relations Committee take significant steps toward its final passage   Congressman Smith said   For years  America has committed to improving the lives of the world s poorest people  In 2000  the U S  joined more than 180 countries at the United Nations Millennium Summit and vowed to reduce global poverty by 2015  We are halfway towards this deadline  and it is time the United States makes it a priority of our foreign policy to meet this goal and help those who are struggling day to day   The Global Poverty Act   Declares it official U S  policy to promote the reduction of global poverty  the elimination of extreme global poverty  and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal of cutting extreme global poverty in half by 2015   Requires the President to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to carry out that policy   Includes guidelines for what the strategy should include   from aid  trade  and debt relief  to working with the international community  businesses and NGOs  to ensuring environmental sustainability   Requires that the President s strategy include specific and measurable goals  efforts to be undertaken  benchmarks  and timetables     Requires the President to report back to Congress on progress made in the implementation of the global poverty strategy    The legislation is supported by a broad range of groups  including Bread for the World  the United States Conference

2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACTS  Liz Richardson Kerry   Michael Ortiz Obama   Liz Farrar  Ellsworth   or Kathleen Connery  Emanuel   Reform Closes Offshore Tax Loopholes that Government Contractors Use To Dodge Social Security Taxes  WASHINGTON  DC   Sens  John Kerry  D Mass   and Barack Obama  D Ill   are introducing the  Fair Share Act of 2008   today with Reps  Brad Ellsworth  IN  and Rahm Emanuel  D Ill   The reform will close the loophole that recently has allowed the defense contractor KBR Inc  to fleece the American taxpayer by almost  100 million a year   It was discovered that KBR has avoided paying its fair share of Social Security and Medicare taxes by creating shell companies in the Cayman Islands  The Fair Share Act of 2008 will end the practice of U S  government contractors setting up sham companies in foreign jurisdictions to avoid payroll taxes   Setting up sham companies in the Cayman Islands to avoid paying Social Security taxes for workers turns the idea of patriotism on its head  No wonder Americans are disgusted with Washington when big corporations profit from no bid contracts for the war in Iraq  then hide money and costs offshore to avoid paying taxes while hard working Americans get stuck with the bill   said Sen  Kerry    KBR is abusing the public trust at the taxpayer s expense  and our reform will close the loophole that enables big corporations to take advantage of the American people     American companies have a responsibility to pay taxes  and guarantee that their employees will receive the Medicare and Social Security benefits they are entitled to through their employment   said Sen  Obama    It s unacceptable for Federal contractors to use foreign affiliates or tax shelters in order to avoid paying their share of payroll taxes and to shirk on their basic obligations to American workers   This critical legislation will increase accountability and transparency of our tax system  and ensure that Federal contractors who are working on behalf of the American taxpayer do not abuse the tax system    These government contractors have been receiving millions  sometimes billions  in taxpayer dollars  Yet they still have the audacity to circumvent our tax system and cheat their workers  the taxpayers  and our government   said Rep  Ellsworth   It s clear Congress cannot stand by and hope these companies will do the right thing  The Fair Share Act restores some needed accountability to the government contracting process  protecting American workers and ensuring all companies compete on an equal playing field    Honest middle class American taxpayers who pay their taxes deserve a tax system where companies cannot use every trick in the book to rig the system to avoid paying their fair share   said Rep  Emanuel   Known best this week as the company who gave our troops tainted water  KBR is taking advantage of a tax loophole that hurts Social Security and Medicare and prevents their own U S  employees working abroad from being able to qualify for these vital programs  And just like we did in 2004 when we closed the Bermuda loophole that allowed companies to lower their taxes by setting up a mailing address in Bermuda  we are going to shut down this egregious loophole   Summary of the Legislation The Fair Share Act of 2008 will end the practice of U S  government contractors setting up shell companies in foreign jurisdictions to avoid payroll taxes   The legislation amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Social Security Act to treat foreign subsidiaries of U S  companies performing services under contract with the United States government as American employers for the purpose of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes   The legislation will apply to foreign subsidiaries of a U S  parent   The degree of common ownership applied by the legislation is 50 percent  meaning that the U S  parent would have to at least own 50 percent of the subsidiary  In addition  the legislation addresses the situation in which a U S  subsidiary of a foreign corporation subcontracts with a foreign subsidiary to perform a contract with the U S government   In this situation  the legislation would apply to wages paid by the foreign subsidiary to its U S  employees  The legislation does not address the situation in which the foreign parent contracts directly with the U S  government   Present law will continue to apply to totalization agreements   Effective Date of Legislation  This legislation applies to services performed after the date of enactment

Suspicious Katrina Contracts Highlight Need for CFO Oversight   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  today issued the following statement in the wake of reports of waste  mismanagement and fraud in the handling Hurricane Katrina rebuilding effort    Just a few weeks into the most expensive rebuilding effort of all time  we re already hearing reports of overcharges  underperformance  and mismanagement   said Obama and Coburn    Finding out after the fact that we re spending taxpayer money on no bid contracts and sweetheart deals for cruise lines is no way to run a recovery effort   We re already seeing examples that highlight the need for an independent CFO who will be in charge of every penny that goes out the door  The American public and the people of the Gulf Coast deserve no less       The Senate Federal Financial Management Subcommittee s investigation into a six month  192 million FEMA contract with Carnival Cruise Lines has discovered that taxpayers are paying  per evacuee  four times the amount a vacation cruise passenger would have to pay   Three Carnival ships are only half full and mostly occupied by relief workers   Carnival s overhead costs in the FEMA operation are far lower than during normal cruises   The Carnival ships are docked   No fuel is being used and no entertainment is being provided to the relief workers   Yet  taxpayers are paying  2 550 per guest per week  which is four times the cost of a  599 per person  7 Day Western Caribbean  Cruise from Galveston  TX   When the federal government would actually save millions of dollars by forgoing the status quo and actually sending evacuees on a luxurious six month cruise it is time to rethink how we are conducting oversight   A short term temporary solution has turned into a long term  grossly overpriced sweetheart deal for a cruise line   Obama and Coburn said    The Coburn Obama bill would create a Chief Financial Officer  CFO  to oversee all expenditures associated with the Hurricane Katrina relief and reconstruction effort  The Hurricane Katrina CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  staffed with experts from relevant federal agencies  and would have management and oversight over any agency using federal funds for the recovery  The CFO would issue monthly financial reports to Congress  and the Government Accountability Office would issue quarterly reports to Congress reviewing the work of the CFO and recovery activities    Richard Skinner  the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security said that FEMA officials awarding contracts  took a lot of shortcuts that may have resulted in a lot of waste    said Obama and Coburn   We should appoint a CFO immediately to ensure that rebuilding and reconstruction money gets to the people who need it the most   SUMMARY OF COBURN OBAMA  OVERSEE ACT   A Chief Financial Officer  CFO  would be established and would be responsible for the efficient and effective use of federal funds in all activities relating to the recovery from Hurricane Katrina   Unlike an IG which audits money after it has been spent  the CFO would review expenditures before they are approved  This is a better way to protect against waste  fraud  and abuse   The CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  and located in the Executive Office of the President   The CFO office would be staffed with experts detailed from relevant federal agencies  would have management and oversight of each federal agency involved in the recovery effort  and would work in conjunction with the inspectors general in each of these agencies and the president   Every month  the CFO would issue financial reports to Congress on the use of federal funds  These reports would include information about the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to persons most in need  the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to companies that hire local workers  and the use of no bid and  cost plus  contracts   The Government Accountability Office  GAO  would issue quarterly reports reviewing the activities and expenses approved by the CFO  These reports would examine the accuracy of the CFO s reports and include information on the use of no bid or  cost plus  contracts  whether federal funds have been used for their intended purposes  and the extent to which federal funds have helped persons most in need and local workers                                     ,Obama

Obama and Coburn s letter       August 14  2006    The Honorable R  David Paulison  Director  Federal Emergency Management Agency  500 C Street S W   Washington  D C  20472 Dear Mr  Paulison  We are writing to express our grave concern about the contracting practices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  that were highlighted August 9th in the Washington Post   According to the Post  four no bid contracts awarded to house Hurricane Katrina evacuees have ballooned in value from  400 million to about  3 4 billion    In private meetings with us on December 15  2005 and May 17  2006  you expressed similar concerns about the use of no bid contracts and promised that FEMA would employ non competitive procedures rarely and only when absolutely necessary to avoid unacceptable disruption to critical services     You also have made similar public statements to our Senate colleagues   In testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on October 6  2005  you stated  I ve been a public servant for a long time  and I ve never been a fan of no bid contracts   Sometimes you have to do them because of the expediency of getting things done   And I can assure that you we are going to look at all of those contracts very carefully   All of those no bid contracts  we are going to go back and re bid  Given your strong statements in opposition to no bid contracts  we were greatly troubled to learn that FEMA is continuing to extend these contracts to the point that their value is now more than eight times the original contract value   Since we are nearing the one year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina  we question whether any emergency remains that would justify a continued reliance on no bid procedures  Indeed  just last week  we learned that the four contractors   Bechtel  CH2M Hill  Fluor  and Shaw   who received the original no bid contracts were awarded new contracts to provide temporary housing   Each of these new awards has a contract ceiling of  250 million   And while the congressional advisory announcing the awards indicates that these contracts were awarded  through a full and open process   concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the competitive process  We cannot express to you in strong enough terms how serious this issue is to us and our Senate colleagues   On four separate occasions over the past year  the Senate has unanimously approved amendments to limit the use of non competitive procedures in contracting  The American people deserve the benefits of competition in government contracts   Competition is good for American business  and it s good for the government   It helps to ensure high quality and low costs   Competition is what the American people have a right to expect  and that s what we intend to achieve   In order for us to assess whether additional Senate action is necessary  we request that you respond to the following questions by August 31  2006 What efforts  if any  have you made to stop the use of no bid procedures  What procedures were used for the latest  250 million contracts awarded to Bechtel  CH2M Hill  Fluor  and Shaw  What  if any  additional resources or authority do you need to stop the use of no bid procedures      Sincerely  Tom Coburn  M D   United States Senator Barack Obama

  Senators Concerned Service Members Suffering from Mental Illness are Not Receiving Impartial Reviews   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Senators Concerned Service Members Suffering from Mental Illness are Not Receiving Impartial Reviews Friday  December 14  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE              Contact  Natalie Ravitz  Boxer   Shana Marchio  Bond   Michael Ortiz  Obama   or Liz Richardson  Kerry   Case of Lt  Whiteside illustrates the need to review DoD policy Washington  D C    U S  Senators Barbara Boxer  D CA   Kit Bond  R MO   Barack Obama   D IL  and John Kerry  D MA  today sent the following letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates    December 14  2007 The Honorable Robert Gates   Secretary of Defense   1000 Defense Pentagon   Washington  DC 20301  Dear Secretary Gates   We are concerned over reports that members of our Armed Forces with underlying mental health conditions are not receiving balanced  fair  and impartial reviews when facing judicial punishment and administrative discharge for engaging in misconduct that could be related to their conditions   We understand and support the necessity of maintaining good order and discipline in the military  At the same time  we are concerned that the decision to prosecute a service member with serious mental health issues may  in some cases  be carried out without appropriate consideration of recommendations made by uniformed mental health providers  As such  we ask you to promptly review guidelines for the administrative handling of such complex cases    On December 2  2007  The Washington Post ran a story entitled    A Soldier   s Officer    that clearly illustrates our concerns  The piece details the ordeal of Army First Lieutenant Elizabeth Whiteside  who according to available reports  served honorably at both Water Reed Army Medical Center  WRAMC  and in Iraq before experiencing severe mental health symptoms and attempting suicide  During her apparent suicide attempt  Lt  Whiteside threatened a number of her fellow service members  and as a result  we understand the Army is currently deciding whether to pursue a court martial against her    What we find particularly troubling about this case is that military commanders with no medical training derided the documented medical opinions as to Lt  Whiteside   s mental condition and their bearing on the case  Colonel Terrence J  McKenrick  commander of the Warrior Transition Brigade at Walter Reed  charged that even though medical professionals had determined Lt  Whiteside had a    severe mental disease or defect  she knowingly assaulted and threatened others and injured herself     Another commander wrote that Lt  Whiteside   s    defense that she suffers from a mental disease excusing her actions is just that   an excuse  an excuse to distract from choices and decisions made by Lt  Whiteside     These statements are contrary to the apparent recommendations of Lt  Whiteside   s battalion commander in Iraq that disciplinary actions not be taken  and show a callous disregard for the diagnosis of qualified psychiatrists at WRAMC  who found that Lt  Whiteside suffered from a    severe major depressive disorder and a personality disorder    and    disassociation with reality      We believe that service members should be held accountable for their actions  and we recognize that the Manual for Courts Martial provides procedures for handling mental health issues in judicial proceedings  However  this case highlights the need for the Department to review its administrative procedures and training programs to ensure that commanders give full and fair consideration of the recommendations made by trained mental health providers before initiating disciplinary actions against soldiers suffering from mental diseases   Additionally  as Senators who have worked extensively to improve mental health care services for our armed forces  we find it unacceptable that officers with no medical training   who are required by law to protect the impartiality of the military justice process   would make dismissive statements regarding Lt  Whiteside   s mental health condition  These comments only undermine respect for the mental health profession and increase the stigma associated with seeking mental health care   According to the Congressionally mandated report of the Department of Defense Task Force on Mental Health     every military leader bears responsibility for addressing stigma  leaders who fail to do so reduce the effectiveness of the service members they lead     The Department is best served by ending policies that discriminate against service members who suffer from mental health problems and working to eliminate the stigma that prevents too many from seeking care  That is why we strongly urge you to ensure that the recommendations of qualified medical professionals play a clearly defined and important role in proceedings to discharge or punish any service member with an underlying mental health condition    Thank you for your consideration of this important request     Sincerely    Barbara Boxer                                             United States Senator                                    Christopher S  Bond  United States Senator

Friday  December 14  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Jesse Broder Van Dyke  Akaka   Michael Ortiz  Obama   or Aaron Murphy  Tester    Washington  DC     U S  Senators Daniel K  Akaka  D HI   Barack Obama  D IL   and Jon Tester  D MT  today sent letters to the Attorney General  and the Inspector Generals of the Defense and State Departments  seeking information about their apparent failure to investigate allegations made by former Halliburton KBR administrative assistant Jamie Leigh Jones that she was drugged and raped by several co workers while employed at Camp Hope in Baghdad  Iraq     The alleged assault occurred in July 2005  three days after KBR had transferred Ms  Jones to work in Iraq   Ms  Jones was treated at a U S  Army Hospital in Iraq after reporting that she was raped   According to recent news reports  no criminal charges have been filed in the matter and reporters have been unable to confirm that any federal agency is investigating       With tens of thousands of American contractors operating in Iraq  we will not tolerate abuse and misconduct  and these contractors must be held accountable to American criminal law     said Senator Obama      I first introduced legislation nearly 10 months ago to hold contractors accountable  and I will continue to work to develop a solution that closes the legal loopholes  protects our troops and civilians  and promotes America   s values     Senator Akaka said     It has been more than two years since Ms  Jones reported that she was drugged and raped   Ms  Jones    allegations are extremely disturbing  yet it seems that KBR  the Defense Department  and the State Department may have ignored the matter rather than seeking the truth   Some media accounts have suggested that security contractors have blanket legal immunity for what they do in Iraq   That is untrue   But the existing legal loopholes for U S  government contractors working abroad     and the widespread perception that these contractors operate completely free of legal constraints     must be addressed   Congress should make this an urgent priority     Akaka noted that jurisdiction for any future criminal charges brought in the case could come under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000 or section 804 of the USA PATRIOT Act      We must ensure that security contractors are subject to real oversight   I will push for a full  fair  and transparent investigation of Jamie Leigh Jones    allegations  and I will continue to support legislation to ensure that security contractors are held to high standards     Akaka stated       I don   t care if it   s in rural Montana  inner city Washington  or military bases in Baghdad   no one is above the law     Senator Tester said      We   ve got some serious questions about this case and it   s not acceptable to sit around waiting for answers     Senator Akaka is Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management  the Federal Workforce  and the District of Columbia  as well as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness   Senators Obama and Tester are

misconduct allegedly committed against Ms  Jamie Leigh Jones while working for Halliburton KBR in Baghdad  Iraq   As you may know  Ms  Jones has filed a civil complaint alleging that she was drugged

transported to the area U S  Army hospital where a rape kit was administered  and KBR informed the State Department of the incident  2    To date  the Justice Department has not filed any charges against anyone in connection with this incident    Please answer the following questions no later than Thursday  December 20  2007    1  When and by whom was your office informed of the alleged attack

   and Barack Obama  D Ill   asked Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin to delay a vote on media ownership until the FCC has followed the will of Congress and established a commission to look into minority and women media ownership  Kerry and Obama made clear that if Martin once again bucked the Congress  they would ask the Appropriations Committee to deny funding for implementation of the rule produced by the forced vote     This is a show down with an FCC Chairman who is letting the FCC do the bidding of big corporate conglomerates without giving smaller media outlets a chance to fight back     said Senator John Kerry     I want to thank Sen  Obama for joining with me to help hold the FCC accountable  and ensuring that it promotes a more diverse  independent media in America          We must ensure that we have an open media market that represents all of the voices in our diverse nation  and allows them to be heard     said Senator Obama      The FCC must meet its obligations to our country   s minority communities and not special interests by ensuring that broadcasters are doing right by the communities they operate in before it considers loosening media ownership regulations   I reiterate my call to the FCC to conduct its rules changes in a transparent and inclusive process  respect minority interests  and delay its upcoming vote until further evaluations are completed      Earlier this month  the Commerce Committee sent Chairman Martin a message with its unanimous approval of a bill that would require Chairman Martin to address the state of minority and women ownership as well as localism before acting on larger media ownership rules   By moving forward with Tuesday   s vote  Chairman Martin is directly contradicting the will of Congress     Senators Kerry and Obama sent a similar letter urging the FCC to act on this issue in July  2006  Earlier this month  the Commerce Committee sent Chairman Martin a message with its unanimous approval of a bill that would require Chairman Martin to address the state of minority and women ownership as well as localism before acting on larger media ownership rules   By moving forward with Tuesday   s vote  Chairman Martin is directly contradicting the will of Congress     Below is the text of the letter  December 14  2007 The Honorable Kevin J  Martin  Chairman  Federal Communications Commission  445 12th Street SW  Washington  DC 20554 Dear Chairman Martin  Your testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee on December 13  2007 restates your intention to move forward aggressively with a proposal that would relax media ownership rules with respect to the Newspaper Broadcast Cross Ownership Rule   We reiterate our call from July of last year and in various forums over the last two months for you to delay this vote for a period of time sufficient for the Commission to examine the status of minority and women media ownership in the United States  and to establish a policy to effectively address the need to promote greater diversity in media markets       With respect to this issue  the intent of the Senate Commerce Committee was made clear with its decision to unanimously report S  2332  the Media Ownership Act of 2007   Section 2 of this bill would require the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  to establish and convene an independent panel to make recommendations for specific rules to increase the representation of women and minorities in the ownership of broadcast media   The bill further states that the FCC must act on the panel s recommendations before voting on any changes to its broadcast and newspaper ownership rules  We recognize the widespread animosity aimed at the direction of the Commission regarding Tuesday   s scheduled vote   We understand that for a variety of reasons you are being asked to postpone the vote to permit more time for the Commission to fully understand how a relaxation in the Cross Ownership Rule will impact other important issues such as localism   It is our hope that the sum of these objections will convince you to delay this vote until a time following the Commission   s consideration of other pressing matters   Specifically  we believe that moving forward with this change will have a direct and detrimental impact on the state of media diversity   Should you decide to move forward with this vote against the expressed bipartisan  bicameral intent of Congress  we will approach Appropriations Chairman Byrd with a request that funds be denied for the implementation of this rule    Thank you for your consideration   Should you have any questions regarding this request  please do not hesitate to contact any of us at any time  Sincerely  Sen  John Kerry                                 Sen  Barack Obama  Kerry and Obama co sponsored a bill that would require the FCC to have a 90 day comment period on any proposed media ownership rule changes and to conduct a separate proceeding on localism with another 90 day comment period   The bill also requires the FCC to convene an independent panel to make recommendations regarding specific rules to increase women and minority ownership of broadcast media   The FCC would be required to act on the panel   s recommendations prior to voting on changes to broadcast ownership regulations   The bill was sponsored by

      Lugar and Obama Urge Destruction of Conventional Weapons Stockpiles Tuesday  August 30  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  August 30  2005  Lugar and Obama Urge Destruction of Conventional Weapons Stockpiles   DONETSK  Ukraine   U S  Senators Dick Lugar  R IN  and Barack Obama  D IL  called for the immediate destruction of 15 000 tons of ammunition  400 000 small arms and light weapons  and 1 000 man portable air defense systems  MANPADS  or shoulder missile launchers that are often sought by terrorists    Lugar and Obama toured the Donetsk State Chemical Production Plant  a conventional weapons destruction facility where the U S  has taken the lead in a three year NATO program to destroy the weapons   Another 117 000 tons of ammunition and 1 1 million small arms and light weapons are slated for destruction within 12 years    So far  the U S  has contributed  2 1 million to the project  and Austria  Bulgaria  Luxembourg  Lithuania  Netherlands  Norway  Slovakia  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom have contributed  1 2 million    While the destruction is ready to begin  the Ukrainian Rada  parliament  first must pass a law exempting the foreign assistance from taxation   Lugar and Obama discussed this issue with Rada Speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn  Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko and President Viktor Yushchenko in meetings yesterday   All three leaders indicated they would promote action before the March 2006 parliamentary elections     The visit underscores the importance of legislation Lugar and Obama have authored that would commit additional U S  resources and expand authorities in cooperative threat reduction of conventional weapons around the world   The bill is part of the Foreign Relations Authorization Bill that is pending in the Senate and will be introduced as a free standing bill by the senators this fall     We discussed MANPADS  landmines and other very highly dangerous explosives   Ukraine has huge stockpiles leftover from previous times that are dangerous to people of this country as well as the possibility for proliferation to other countries   Lugar said    We are working to obtain funds to secure and destroy these weapons in cooperative threat reduction   We are encouraging the U S  and Ukraine to work together and to obtain more funds   We came here to see the problem and the solution with our own eyes     By the late 1980 s  75 percent of all Ukraine s industrial capacity was used to produce Soviet weaponry  including strategic weapons   In June 1996  the Nunn Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program successfully achieved the removal of all 1 240 deployed SS 19 and SS 24 strategic nuclear warheads from Ukraine     Vast stocks of conventional munitions and military supplies have accumulated in Ukraine   Some of this stockpile dates from World War I and II  yet most dates from Cold War buildup and the stocks left behind by Soviet withdrawals from East Germany  the Czech Republic  Hungry and Poland   Obama said   We need to eliminate these stockpiles for the safety of the Ukrainian people and people around world  by keeping them out of conflicts around the world     Estimates by the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency suggest a significant proliferation and public safety threat from the 7 million small arms and light weapons and 2 million tons of conventional ammunition stored in more than 80 depots across Ukraine   These depots were never designed to hold such large stockpiles and remain vulnerable to those seeking such weapons or their components  or to spontaneous detonation in some of the older and larger ammunition stockpiles     In March  the Foreign Relations Committee added the Lugar Disarmament Initiative  LDI  to the Foreign Affairs Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2006 and 2007   The LDI is modeled on the original Nunn Lugar Act   Its purpose is to provide the Department of State with a focused response to the threat posed by vulnerable stockpiles of conventional weapons around the world  including tactical missiles and MANPADS   Such missile systems could be used by terrorists to attack commercial airliners  military installations and government facilities in the U S  and abroad   Reports suggest that Al Qaeda has attempted to acquire these kinds of weapons   In addition  unsecured conventional weapons stockpiles are a major obstacle to peace  reconstruction and economic development in regions suffering from instability     This bill declares it to be the policy of the United States to seek out surplus and unguarded stocks of conventional armaments  including small arms and light weapons  and tactical missile systems for elimination or safeguarding   It authorizes the Department of State to carry out an accelerated global effort to destroy such weapons and to cooperate with allies and international organizations when possible   The Secretary of State is charged with devising a strategy for prioritizing  on a country by country basis  the obligation of funds in a global program of conventional arms elimination   Lastly  the Secretary is required to unify program planning  coordination and implementation of the strategy into one office at the State Department and to request a budget commensurate with the risk posed by these weapons    During the trip  the senators have inspected a nuclear warhead storage facility and missile destruction facility in Russia and biological laboratories in Russia and Ukraine   On Thursday  they will review sea interdiction exercises on the Caspian Sea in Azerbaijan      In 1991  Senator Lugar  R IN  and former Senator Sam Nunn  D GA  authored the Nunn Lugar Act  which established the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program  This program has provided U S  funding and expertise to help the former Soviet Union safeguard and dismantle its enormous stockpiles of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons  related materials  and delivery systems  In 1997  Lugar and Nunn were joined by Senator Pete Domenici  R NM  in introducing the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act  which expanded Nunn Lugar authorities in the former Soviet Union and provided WMD expertise to first responders in American cities  In 2003  Congress adopted the Nunn Lugar Expansion Act  which authorized the Nunn Lugar program to operate outside the former Soviet Union to address proliferation threats  In October 2004  Nunn Lugar funds were used for the first time outside of the former Soviet Union to secure chemical weapons in Albania  under a Lugar led expansion of the program    The latest Nunn Lugar Scorecard shows that the program has deactivated or destroyed  6 760 nuclear warheads  587 ICBMs  483 ICBM silos  32 ICBM mobile missile launchers  150 bombers  789 nuclear air to surface missiles  436 submarine missile launchers  549 submarine launched missiles  28 nuclear submarines  and 194 nuclear test tunnels    Beyond the scorecard s nuclear elimination  the Nunn Lugar program secures and destroys chemical weapons  and works to reemploy scientists and facilities related to biological weapons in peaceful research initiatives  The International Science and Technology Centers  of which the United States is the leading sponsor  have engaged 58 000 former weapons scientists in peaceful work  The International Proliferation Prevention Program has funded 750 projects involving 14 000 former weapons scientists and created some 580 new peaceful high tech jobs  Ukraine  Belarus and Kazakhstan are nuclear weapons free as a result of cooperative efforts under the Nunn Lugar program  They otherwise would be the world s the third  forth and eighth largest nuclear weapons powers  respectively     For more information on the Nunn Lugar Program  visit     Lugar is Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Obama is a new member of the committee this year

  Obama Calls on FTC to Investigate Impact of BP Pipeline Closure on Consumers   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Calls on FTC to Investigate Impact of BP Pipeline Closure on Consumers Monday  August 14  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Tommy Vietor or Robert Gibbs   202  228 5511  Date  August 14  2006  Obama Calls on FTC to Investigate Impact of BP Pipeline Closure on Consumers   WASHINGTON   In a letter to Federal Trade Commission  FTC  Chairman Deborah Platt Majoras  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  Monday requested that the FTC investigate what impact BP s closure of the Prudhoe Bay pipelines along the North Slope of Alaska will have on consumers    It is clear that the closure of these pipelines   will have an effect on the economic well being of the State of Alaska and on gas prices for American consumers   Obama said   Nevertheless  last week  the President of BP America would not answer a direct question from a network reporter as to whether or not BP would pass along the costs of its mistakes to customers  despite the company recording profits of  22 6 billion last year     According to news accounts  BP did not anticipate in some cases that 20  and 30 year old pipes would require regular safety inspections using some of the latest available technology  A BP official reportedly admitted that a pipeline in operation since 1977 had never even been tested using an industry standard procedure known as  smart pigging   Had the appropriate tests been conducted  BP would likely have known that some areas of the pipes had corroded to the point of becoming  paper thin   It also appears that BP may have actually scaled back the use of costly but needed corrosion inhibitors in some of its pipelines     The news of this pipeline closure has already further increased record high gas prices for consumers across the country   said Obama   BP shouldn t make things worse by passing the cost of their mistake on to consumers     Below please find the full text of Obama s letter      August 14  2006   The Honorable Deborah Platt Majoras  Chairman  Federal Trade Commission  600 Pennsylvania Ave  NW  Washington  DC  20580   Dear Chairman Majoras    I am writing to request that the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  investigate the impact on consumers of BP s closure of the Prudhoe Bay pipelines along the North Slope of Alaska     The FTC is charged with protecting consumers from negligent business practices that can distort prices and harm consumers   Over the last several years  the FTC has conducted several studies on high oil prices   As recently as May 2006  the FTC issued a report that concluded that oil companies were not manipulating the market or fixing prices in the wake of Hurricane Katrina   A related issue is whether short sighted efforts by companies like BP to cut corners have resulted in unnecessary environmental degradation or unfair price increases to American consumers     According to news accounts  BP did not anticipate in some cases that 20  and 30 year old pipes would require regular safety inspections using some of the latest available technology   Indeed  a BP official reportedly admitted that a pipeline in operation since 1977 had never even been tested using an industry standard procedure known as  smart pigging    Had the appropriate tests been conducted  BP would likely have known that some areas of the pipes had corroded to the point of becoming  paper thin    It also appears that BP may have actually scaled back the use of costly but needed corrosion inhibitors in some of its pipelines    Only after some 267 000 gallons of crude oil spilled on Alaska s North Slope in March 2006 did BP finally take steps to expand its inspection regime and check for possible corrosion   At that point  however  it was too late to do anything but shut down the pipelines and replace the corroded segments   Had BP taken the proper precautions  it might have been able to prevent the environmental damage caused by the leak and last week s untimely shutdown of production     It is clear that the closure of these pipelines   despite the restoration of some production capacity in recent days   will have an effect on the economic well being of the State of Alaska and on gas prices for American consumers   Nevertheless  last week  the President of BP America would not answer a direct question from a network reporter as to whether or not BP would pass along the costs of its mistakes to customers  despite the company recording profits of  22 6 billion last year     I believe that companies like BP have an essential role to play in America s energy future   Large oil companies are too important and receive too many public benefits to shirk their public responsibility   The government must ensure that the appropriate environmental protections and consumer safeguards are in place and that these companies are properly balancing the interests of shareholders and consumers   Indeed  the guarantee that American consumers will be protected from negligent and shortsighted business practices serves as a linchpin to the smooth functioning of our markets     Accordingly  I ask that the FTC investigate the consumer impact caused by BP s disregard for environmental safety and sound business planning   It is important for the FTC to assess the harm done to consumers and determine what if any steps must be taken by BP  other energy companies  regulatory agencies or Congress in order to protect the American consumer from unnecessary disruptions and price increases in the future     Please let me know by August 31  2006  whether you will agree to open such an investigation   Thank you     Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator                                    ,Obama

Mattel today announced the recall of 253 000 lead contaminated toy jeeps WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to U S  Trade Representative  Ambassador Susan Schwab  about the large number of lead tainted toys manufactured in China that have been subject to federal government recalls   In the letter  Obama requests information as to whether the USTR has raised concerns about these toys with the Chinese government   Last week Obama called on the Toy Industry Association to provide insight as to how American companies are attempting to regulate foreign supply chains   And in July  he called on the Senate Commerce Committee to pass his Lead Free Toys Act of 2007  S  1306   which would protect our children from products containing lead  Obama originally introduced this legislation in November 2005  The text of the letter is below  Dear Ambassador Schwab  I am writing to urge the Office of the United States Trade Representative  USTR  to take aggressive action to protect America   s children from toys containing harmful levels of lead that are imported from China   This is a serious issue that compromises the health of children throughout the country  While lead paint has been banned in the United States since 1978  nearly half a million children continue to suffer from lead poisoning   Lead is a highly toxic substance that can produce a range of health problems in young children including IQ deficiencies  reading and learning disabilities  reduced attention spans  hyperactivity  and damage to the kidneys  brain and bone marrow   Though the most common source of lead exposure is from lead paint in older homes  children are exposed to lead in other ways  including through the toys they play with in their homes  playgrounds  and schools  As you are no doubt aware  in recent months  there have been a number of high profile recalls of children   s products manufactured in China  In March 2007  the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  announced three separate recalls of 108 600 units of children s necklaces and 128 700    Elite Operations    toy sets due to high lead paint content   In April  4 million    Groovy Grabber    bracelets and 396 000 metal key chains were recalled because of high lead content   In May  103 000 pieces of metal jewelry marketed in conjunction with    High School Musical    were recalled because of high lead content   In June  the RC2 Corporation recalled 1 5 million Thomas   Friends wooden toy railway sets that were coated with excessive levels of lead paint   Two weeks ago  Mattel announced the recall of 83 types of toys worldwide because the paint in the toys contained excessive amounts of lead   This worldwide recall involved almost 1 million plastic preschool toys  including the popular Big Bird  Elmo  Dora and Diego characters    And just today  Mattel announced the recall of 253 000 toy jeeps featuring the Sarge character from the movie    Cars       Since we first learned about the dangers of these products  the CPSC has taken steps to remove these toys from store shelves   But recent product recalls raise a larger question about whether our government should take proactive steps to prevent the importation of potentially dangerous children   s products  particularly toys manufactured in China  In 2006  China was the largest importer of toys  dolls  and games to the American marketplace   These imports total  14 6 billion and account for 86  of total U S  imports of toys  dolls  and games   Although most of these toys are safe  recent events suggest that a number of Chinese manufacturers are cutting corners and using cheap and illegal substitutes such as lead paint   The resulting lower prices of many foreign made toys are attractive  especially to low income families  who  along with the rest of our citizens  trust that products imported into the United States undergo a thorough inspection   Unfortunately  it appears that their trust may be misplaced  If we have an opportunity to protect our nation   s most vulnerable population     our children     from harmful toxins  we should do so  and a good place to start is safeguarding their toys   Since the USTR is responsible for developing and coordinating U S  international trade policy and overseeing negotiations with other countries  I am interested in learning the following    Given the large number of toys imported from China with high lead levels  has USTR raised concerns about this issue with the Chinese government   If so  what is the response of the Chinese government to these concerns  If these concerns have not been raised with the Chinese government  does USTR intend to raise this issue in the near future  I request that you respond to these questions by August 21  2007   Thank you  Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator                                    ,Obama

  Bayh  Obama Introduce Legislation To Reduce Barriers to Responsible Fatherhood   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Bayh  Obama Introduce Legislation To Reduce Barriers to Responsible Fatherhood Friday  June 15  2007  For Immediate Release  Contact  Eric Kleiman  Bayh  or Ben LaBolt  Obama    Senators say men must take responsibility for raising their children   Washington  D C      U S  Senators Evan Bayh  D IN  and Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced legislation to encourage more men to take responsibility for their children and to address the challenges faced by millions of American families as a result of the national epidemic of absentee fathers   In the last 40 years  the number of children without fathers in America has more than quadrupled  from 5 million in 1960 to more than 24 million today  An estimated 40 percent of the children who live in fatherless households have not seen their fathers in at least one year  Studies show that children without fathers in their lives are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime  nine times more likely to drop out of school  and 20 times more likely to end up in prison  They also are more likely to have behavioral problems  to run away from home  and to become teenage parents themselves   The Responsible Fatherhood and Healthy Families Act of 2007 removes government penalties on married families and offers support for fathers trying to do the right thing while cracking down on men who avoid their parental responsibilities  The bill would provide fathers with innovative job training services and other economic opportunities  while expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to help non custodial parents trying to support their families  It would also increase child support enforcement by helping governments collect a projected  13 billion in payments from those who don   t fulfill their parental responsibilities   The Bayh Obama legislation would help ensure that money paid for child support goes directly to children and their mothers and does not result in loss of food assistance for eligible families  It would also strengthen domestic violence prevention services       Conceiving a child doesn   t make you a man  but raising one responsibly does     Bayh said     Fatherlessness is an issue many politicians would prefer to avoid  but elected officials have a moral obligation not to sit idly by while communities crumble because of the epidemic of absentee fathers  I am not na  ve enough to believe that government alone can solve this problem  but together we can play a constructive role in crafting policies that attack the root causes of this epidemic  Fatherless children are more likely to do poorly in school and have emotional and behavioral problems  They are more likely to commit crimes  smoke cigarettes  and abuse drugs and alcohol  Many of our most pressing societal ills can be addressed by tackling the fatherhood crisis effectively          As fathers  we need to teach our boys what makes you a man is not just having a child  it   s having the courage to raise a child     Obama said     Congress can make it easier for those who make that responsible choice   and make it harder for those who avoid it  This legislation will provide support for fathers who are trying to do the right thing in making child support payments by providing them with job training and job opportunities and expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit  It stops penalizing marriage in the tax code and makes sure that children and families  not the government  receive every penny of child support  It would also crack down on those who avoid their responsibility by increasing child support enforcement  a measure that will collect nearly  13 billion in payments that can help raise  nurture  and educate children      In the U S  House of Representatives  companion legislation is being introduced by Congresswoman Julia Carson  D IN  and Congressman Danny Davis  D IL        This is good legislation for families across Indiana and America     Carson said     It sends a message to our men that  once you become a parent  you have a responsibility to that child and we   re going to hold you accountable  but we   re also going to provide you the tools for success   The role a father plays in the life of a child is invaluable  and it   s heartbreaking to consider that almost 25 million kids in this country grow up without a father in their lives   This legislation will take steps toward changing that          This bill is a key component of a fresh approach to family support  one which supports and strengthens families before they are at risk     Davis said     This legislation provides the tools to strengthen relationships between fathers and their children and encourages fathers to become good nurturers and providers  The fullest positive participation by fathers helps to create a caring environment capable of fostering optimal child development  promotes humanistic cultural and community traditions while reducing poverty  teenage pregnancies  juvenile delinquency and incidents of child abuse and neglect  In the process of assuming responsibility for fatherhood  fathers themselves acquire new self confidence  new parenting skills  higher educational accomplishments and greater economic independence      Last year  Congress passed legislation based on a proposal introduced by Senator Bayh that provided up to  50 million each year for the next five years in funding for responsible fatherhood programs nationwide as part of the spending reconciliation bill

equivalent of taking 30 million cars off the road  as an amendment to the energy bill  The amendment is based on the National Low Carbon Fuel Standard Act he introduced with Senator Harkin earlier this year   Senator Obama delivered the following remarks on the floor of the Senate        The facts about our nation   s energy consumption are not pretty          The U S  currently consumes one quarter of the world   s oil  60  of the oil that we consume comes from foreign countries  including many countries whose interests are hostile to ours   To make matters worse  the oil used in the U S  transportation sector accounts for one third of our nation   s emissions of greenhouse gases   It is long past time for the U S  to take significant steps to use oil more efficiently in order to deal with the dual challenges of climate change and energy dependence          In January of this year  California took an important first step towards addressing this problem by establishing a low carbon fuel standard for passenger vehicle fuels sold in the state   Under the California standard  the carbon intensity of these fuels would be reduced by 10 percent by 2020          In signing the executive order creating the low carbon fuel standard  Governor Schwarzenegger noted just some of the dangers of his state   s excessive reliance on gasoline   volatile oil prices dictated by hostile foreign countries  lack of economic security  American jobs at risk  businesses in jeopardy  and most importantly  dangerous levels of greenhouse gas emissions          I applaud the Governor   s leadership on this issue  and now I want to take his proposal one giant step further   Today  I rise to discuss an amendment that I have introduced to establish a national low carbon fuel standard for the entire transportation fuel pool in this country     whether the fuel is used for cars  trucks  or airplanes          If my proposal were to become law  by the year 2015  the carbon emissions in our national fuel supply would be 5 percent less than they are now   By the year 2020  the carbon emissions would be 10 percent less          The effect of these seemingly modest reductions would be significant   According to one estimate  a national low carbon fuel standard would reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by about 180 million metric tons in 2020   This is the equivalent of taking over 30 million cars off the road in 2020          My approach would reduce carbon emissions overall in the transportation fuel pool  but it wouldn   t dictate what feedstocks could satisfy the low carbon fuel standard or how many gallons of a particular fuel would have to be produced   Instead  fuels could be mixed and matched to achieve the carbon reduction targets          In essence  the market would dictate what pool of fuels would be sold in the U S  in order to satisfy the requirements   The fuels could be corn based ethanol  cellulosic ethanol  biodiesel made from soybeans  electricity used by plug in hybrid vehicles  or perhaps some kind of fuel that hasn   t even been developed yet   The only requirement is that the overall mix of fuels sold in the U S  would have to meet the carbon reduction targets set forth in my proposal          This is a new concept     indeed  less than six months have passed since California adopted it    and I know some of my colleagues are not familiar with how it would work   So  let me address the relationship between the low carbon fuel standard and something we know a lot about    the Renewable Fuels Standard          Under the able leadership of the two senators from New Mexico  the Energy Committee has crafted the underlying bill to require greater volumes of biofuels in our national fuel supply   The bill increases national production goals in the RFS over the next 15 years and establishes the first production targets of next generation fuels such as cellulosics          Under the bill  the RFS target would increase to 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by the year 2022   When combined with the new advanced biofuels requirements in the bill  this would result in an estimated 2 to 6 percent reduction in carbon emissions in our national fuel pool in 15 years   These are significant reductions  but I believe we can do better          My low carbon fuel standard would require a 10 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2020   I know that sounds ambitious  but the magnitude of our nation   s problems demands bold and innovative action   Indeed  the experts with whom we have consulted firmly believe that a 10 percent reduction is realistic with greater research into advanced biofuels and new fuel sources   But that research will only happen if businesses are assured of a market for their new products   And just as the existing RFS has spurred the construction of ethanol plants  a low carbon fuel standard would incentivize the development of new advanced fuels          We in Congress support biofuels because these fuels strengthen our energy security  support our rural communities  and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions   But our current policy doesn   t recognize producers when they do a better job of achieving these goals   Our farmers  manufacturers  and investors are ready to produce better biofuels     fuels that are more efficient  fuels that support a broader base of rural communities  fuels that reduce greenhouse gases by 90  or more     but they need a signal that their investment in better performance will be recognized in the marketplace          Let me be clear     a low carbon fuel standard is not intended to replace the RFS  instead  the two standards would complement each other by encouraging greater use of renewable fuels   But here   s an important difference between the two standards   the RFS evaluates renewable fuel based on the feedstock that creates the fuel  while the low carbon fuel standard looks at the carbon emissions produced by the fuel   And that   s an important distinction as we wrestle with perhaps the greatest challenge of our generation     climate change          Going forward  it   s not enough just to say that a fuel uses home grown products like corn or soybeans   We also need to look at what effect the fuel has on carbon emissions   My proposal does that  and in doing so  offers something for everyone          If you support rural America  this approach ensures widespread development and use of biofuels from agriculture products          If you support energy security  this approach reduces our consumption of oil by 30 billion gallons by 2020     60  of which would have to be imported from foreign sources          If you support certainty for industry  this approach provides the market certainty that is critical for investment dollars in key technologies          And most importantly  if you support the environment  this approach reduces carbon emissions by 180 metric tons by 2020 and ensures that any future billon dollar capital investment in a fuel plant would have to produce a fuel with better lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than conventional gasoline   Because under a low carbon fuel standard  there would be no place for carbon intensive fuels          The energy debate this week underscores the fact that  as we pursue the best course of action for our energy independence  there are no perfect answers   There is no single fuel or feedstock that offers the best combination of affordability  reliability  transportability  and sensitivity to the environment      and even if there were  I   m not sure we here in this chamber would be the most qualified to identify it          But  our current course     that is  maintaining our dependency on unstable regions of the world for the fuel that we cannot live without     is far too great a risk to delay action   That requires us to take aggressive action that will set the stage for the second and third generation of fuels that will truly help us achieve energy independence and fight global warming   A low carbon fuel standard accomplishes these goals          Finally  let me say a word to my colleagues about climate change   Now I know that when it comes to the word    carbon     the range of views among my colleagues is varied and complex   I am among those Senators who believe carbon from human activities contributes to climate change  that it is an immediate threat  and that we must immediately require emission reductions through a strong cap and trade system   Others among my colleagues agree with some type of a carbon controlled economy  but disagree with the various legislative approaches to date   Still others believe the climate is in no imminent danger          My proposal addresses carbon  but it allows my colleagues to maintain their differences on the larger debate on climate change while coming together to achieve progress on all of our multiple policy goals     whether it   s ending our energy dependence  attacking the problem of climate change  promoting economic stability  or creating American jobs          I am fully aware that this proposal may be ahead of its time  but given the magnitude of our problems  we can   t afford to be too cautious in our policy solutions   I urge my colleagues to learn more about a low carbon fuel standard  and if they do so  I know they will see the merits of it                                       ,Obama

Linda Springer  the Director of the Office of Personnel Management  OPM   to respond to reports that certain health care plans are charging unnecessarily high copayments for prescription drugs   A recent report in the New York Times indicated that many health care plan participants  including federal government employees  are facing copayments as high as 20 33 percent of the cost of drugs   Such high copayments can translate into thousands of dollars out of pocket for patients affected by diseases such as cancer  multiple sclerosis  or hepatitis  rendering such drugs unaffordable  Some health care plans  including the Kaiser health plan mentioned in the Times article  are offered through the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program  FEHBP   which covers over 8 million federal employees nationally and is regulated by OPM  In the letter  Senator Obama requests that OPM provide information as to the prevalence of  tiered copayments  in certain plans  how many federal employees are charged in each tier of copayment  whether enrollees can choose between plans with various copayment options  and what further federal regulation is needed to ensure federal employees have access to affordable life saving or disease modifying drugs  The text of the letter is below  Dear Ms  Springer  An April 14  2008  article in the New York Times highlighted the unconscionable practice of health plans charging exorbitantly high copayments for drugs   Many participants in these health plans are facing copayments as high as 20 33 percent of the cost of drugs  subject to an annual maximum   Such high copayments can translate into thousands of dollars out of pocket for patients affected by diseases such as cancer  multiple sclerosis  or hepatitis  rendering such drugs unaffordable    This situation is troubling for several reasons   For many of these drugs  there are no affordable drug alternatives  including generic drugs   These higher copayment schemes also do not take into consideration the value of a drug  with respect to long term financial implications and health and quality of life outcomes for patients   Further  this practice runs contrary to the underlying premise of health insurance  which is to spread health care risk  unfairly penalizing patients who become ill    The New York Times article focuses on the Kaiser health plan  which is offered through the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program  FEHBP    FEHBP provides health coverage to over 8 million federal employees nationally   With over 200 health plans participating in FEHBP  enrollees have many options from which to choose   Yet  the majority of federal employees are enrolled in a national plan  and only a small fraction of employees change plans every year    Given the Office of Personnel Management s role in overseeing FEHBP  I request that you respond to the following questions   What is the prevalence of  tiered copayments  in such plans and how are such copayments structured   What are the long term trends and projections for this payment model     What are the median and maximum copayments required   Is there a cap on the amount to be paid out of pocket for patients who are prescribed premium drugs in the higher tiers      Have  tiered copayments  demonstrably lowered premiums for enrollees   If so  to what extent    How many FEHBP participants are charged copayments in each tier of copayment   What is the range of out of pocket costs for participants in each tier    Are FEHBP enrollees in a particular health plan able to choose between insurance products that charge flat copayments and those charging a certain percentage of drug cost as the copayment     What  percentages of drug costs are charged to FEHBP enrollees as copayments for drugs for which no generics or cheaper alternatives exist    What  if any  additional federal regulation is needed to ensure that FEHBP enrollees are able to access critical  life saving or disease modifying drugs     I would appreciate an answer by April 30  2008   Thank you    Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator                               Pursuant to  policy

                                    Obama Calls on President to Take Immediate Action to Protect Our Children From Lead  Tainted Toys Wednesday  August 15  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Obama Press Office 202 228 5566 Consumer Product Safety Commission has been without a chair for 13 months WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to President Bush  urging him to do everything possible to protect our children from toys contaminated with lead   In the letter  Obama calls on the President to immediately nominate a chairman to the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  who will be a forceful advocate for the interests of American parents   Since July 2006  the CPSC has been operating without a full set of commissioners  preventing the remaining two commissioners from voting on civil penalties or taking regulatory action   Obama also requests that the President support a funding increase for the CPSC to protect America   s children from lead contaminated toys   In November 2005  Obama introduced the Lead Free Toys Act to provide the CPSC with the authority to ban children   s products containing lead as hazardous substances  The text of the letter is below  Dear President Bush  In light of the recent recalls of lead contaminated toys manufactured in China  it is incumbent upon our government and our business to do everything possible to protect our children from dangerous products   For that reason  I have written over the past two weeks to the Senate Commerce Committee  the Toy Industry Association  and the U S  Trade Representative urging immediate action to rid the marketplace of toys containing lead paint    The White House can     and should     take immediate action as well  including   nominating a chairman to the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  who is committed to the interests of consumers  instead of industry  and increasing the CPSC   s resources and authority   In recent months  there have been a number of high profile recalls of children   s products manufactured in China involving lead paint   Lead is a highly toxic substance that can produce a range of health problems in young children including IQ deficiencies  reading and learning disabilities  reduced attention spans  hyperactivity  and damage to the kidneys  brain and bone marrow    Some of the recent recalls of Chinese manufactured toys include  In March 2007  the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  announced three separate recalls of 108 600 units of children s necklaces and 128 700    Elite Operations    toy sets due to high lead paint content   In April  4 million    Groovy Grabber    bracelets and 396 000 metal key chains were recalled because of high lead content   In May  103 000 pieces of metal jewelry marketed in conjunction with    High School Musical    were recalled because of high lead content   In June  the RC2 Corporation recalled 1 5 million Thomas   Friends wooden toy railway sets that were coated with excessive levels of lead paint    Two weeks ago  Mattel announced the recall of 83 types of toys worldwide because the paint in the toys contained excessive amounts of lead   This worldwide recall involved almost 1 million plastic preschool toys  including the popular Big Bird  Elmo  Dora and Diego characters    And just yesterday  Mattel announced the recall of 253 000 toy jeeps featuring the Sarge character from the movie    Cars    due to lead paint on the jeeps    The CPSC is the primary federal agency charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of serious injury or death   However  since July 2006  the CPSC has been operating without a full set of commissioners   According to the Consumer Product Safety Act  the two remaining commissioners can continue their regulatory activities for six months after a vacancy  but after those six months  a commission with only two members is not able to vote on civil penalties or take regulatory action   It has now been thirteen months without a full commission  In order for the CPSC to safeguard the interests of our most vulnerable consumers    our children    it is important that a third commissioner be named as soon as possible   And  because the current vacancy is for a new chairman  it is important to name someone who has a longstanding commitment to consumer protection   Unfortunately  the background of your first nominee for the chairman position did not indicate such a commitment  In March  you nominated Michael E  Baroody  executive vice president for the National Association of Manufacturers  NAM   to be the CPSC chairman   A number of well respected advocacy groups objected to Mr  Baroody   s nomination because of his history of working to    dilute safety proposals pending before the Commission      Among the initiatives Mr  Baroody spearheaded at NAM was opposition to a CPSC proposal to improve safety standards for baby walkers   Further raising concerns about Mr  Baroody   s ability to act independently from the industry that he was supposed to be regulating was his acceptance of a  150 000 severance payment from NAM   Mr  Bardoody withdrew his nomination in May      Leading the nation   s premier product safety commission is an important responsibility that should be entrusted to someone who can be a forceful advocate for the CPSC   s mission   I urge you to nominate someone quickly who will safeguard the interests of American parents  instead of manufacturers    In addition to nominating a new chairman    which will give the CPSC the required number of members to take regulatory action    it is important that the commission be given the resources it needs to perform its mission   For the last several years  the commission   s funding has hovered around  60 million annually even though more and more foreign manufactured consumer products are entering the market   The number of full time staffers at CPSC has also shrunk to about 400 employees  less than half the size of the staff in 1980  Recently  the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill to increase the CPSC budget to  70 million     7 2 million above last year   s amount and  6 8 million above the Administration   s budget request   If the Administration is serious about protecting America   s children from dangerous toys  I ask you to publicly announce your support for this funding increase   Moreover  the CPSC should have the authority to ban children   s products containing lead as hazardous substances   That is exactly what the Lead Free Toys Act  which I introduced in both the 109th and 110th Congresses  would do   I hope the Administration will consider supporting this important legislation  The American people     and in particular  American parents     trust that the products they are purchasing have undergone a thorough inspection and are safe to use   We need to ensure that their trust is not misplaced  and so I call on you to take immediate steps to allow the Consumer Product Safety Commission to function more effectively   Thank you  Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator

                                  Obama Introduces Legislation to Help Property Owners Safeguard Against Lead Hazards in the Home Friday  November 18  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  November 18  2005  Obama Introduces Legislation to Help Property Owners Safeguard Against Lead Hazards in the Home   Washington  DC   Today  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Mike DeWine  R OH  and Gordon Smith  R OR  introduced legislation providing a tax credit for safely removing lead based paint hazards from homes and rental units   This bipartisan bill would provide needed incentives for property owners to ensure that homes are free of environmental hazards that can harm children    As both a father of two young daughters and a lawmaker  it pains me to think that each year nearly 28 000 children needlessly suffer from lead paint poisoning   said Obama   We need to take immediate action to protect our children by ensuring that dangerous lead paint is cleaned up properly      This bill will help to achieve the federal government s established goal of eliminating toxic blood levels in young children by 2010   Exposure in the home is the number one source of lead for young children   By providing financial incentives to remove lead hazards from the home  exposure will be minimized and this disease  which is known to have incredibly harmful effects on child development  behavior and intelligence  can be prevented   We need to continue to work to end childhood lead poisoning and to ensure safe and healthy environments for our children   said Senator Clinton     As parents  we try to protect our kids as much as possible when they walk out the front door  when they re on the roads  or when they re on the playground with friends   But one of the biggest health risks to our kids can occur inside the home   said Senator DeWine    Dangerous lead paint exposures are entirely preventable   It just makes sense that we encourage parents to remove this hazard and protect our children      Lead poisoning is all the more tragic because it is preventable   Smith said    The homes where lead paint is most common are often the ones with families who lack the resources to remove it   It will take years to entirely remove this hazard  but we can get it done more quickly with a boost in financial support     This bill would change the IRS code of 1986 to provide a tax credit for 50  of the allowable costs paid by the taxpayer  up to a maximum of  3000 for lead abatement and  1000 for interim control measures  which could include window replacement  safe repainting and specialized renovation work practices to reduce lead hazards   These are cost effective means of protecting the largest number of children in the near term   The credit is targeted to homes with children younger than six years of age  women of childbearing age  low income residents  and buildings built before 1960  as these include more than 96  of all units where lead based paint is prevalent     Lead is highly toxic and continues to be a major preventable environmental health threat especially to infants  children  and pregnant women in the United States  Lead poisoning can be deadly  and almost one million children nationwide have toxic lead levels in their blood  that can impair their growth and the function of vital organs and motor skills   The most common source of lead exposure for children today is lead paint in older housing and the contaminated lead dust it generates   Despite a ban on lead paint in 1978  there are still millions of housing units in the United States that contain lead paint  especially in older homes        Illinois has the highest lead poisoning rate in the nation  According to an Illinois Department of Public Health report  Illinois amounted to 20 5 percent of all elevated blood levels reported nationwide  The report also found that African American children are more than three times as likely to suffer from elevated lead levels and Hispanic children are more than twice as likely to suffer from elevated lead levels    In New York State  about five percent of children screened for lead poisoning at age two were found to have elevated blood lead levels  more than twice the national average   New York counties where kids are especially at risk include  Onondaga  Fulton  Monroe  Erie  and Oneida  Approximately 10 000 cases of childhood lead poisoning in New York are found each year   Minority and poor children are disproportionately at risk   For example  in New York City  about 95  of children with elevated blood levels were African American  Hispanic or Asian    Senator Clinton and her colleagues have a strong record of advocacy on environmental health issues  Earlier this year  Senators Clinton and DeWine introduced the Family Asthma Act  which seeks to increase research into the links between environmental pollutants and the growing epidemic of asthma  And yesterday  Senators Obama and Clinton introduced the Healthy Communities Act  which would establish Health Action Zones to address environmental health concerns in our nation s most affected communities  Senator Clinton has also introduced the bipartisan Coordinated Environmental Health Network Act to strengthen the environmental health tracking program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention                                   ,Obama

  Obama Introduces Bill to Reduce Teen Pregnancies in Minority Communities   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Introduces Bill to Reduce Teen Pregnancies in Minority Communities Monday  July 16  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt      Legislation would strengthen community based efforts  establish national information database WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced the Communities of Color Teen Pregnancy Prevention Act of 2007  which would help prevent teen pregnancies in minority communities   This legislation would strengthen community based intervention efforts for teen pregnancy services  establish a comprehensive national database to provide culturally and linguistically sensitive information on teen pregnancy reduction  and support research on teen pregnancy in communities of color   U S  Representative Hilda Solis sponsored this bill in the House  H R  468       Teen pregnancy can derail the plans of students with dreams of achieving professional success  and it   s hitting minority communities particularly hard     said Senator Obama      While the country   s overall teen birth rate continues to decline  pregnancies in African American and Latino communities remain inexcusably high   We must develop innovative approaches to strengthen our community support networks and services to educate our teens about pregnancy and provide them with every chance to succeed in school and beyond      Recently  the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics released a study showing that in 2005  the teen birth rate hit a new low   In 2005  the adolescent birth rate was 21 per 1 000 young women ages 15 17  which represents a decline of more than 40 percent from 1991 to 2005   Yet despite this good news  nearly 750 000 teens will become pregnant this year and approximately 4 million will contract a sexually transmitted infection   According to the Forum study  communities of color continue to be at significantly higher risk for teen pregnancies    The birth rate among 15 17 year old African American and Latina adolescents is 3 times and 4 times higher  respectively  than the rate for white teens   According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy  over half of Latina teens and African American girls will get pregnant at least once before age 20   The Communities of Color Teen Pregnancy Prevention Act creates a three pronged approach to reverse these trends   This bill provides grants to public and private non profit entities for community based intervention efforts targeting schools  the family  and the media to promote and strengthen communication and services regarding teen pregnancy   It establishes grants for the creation of a National Clearinghouse to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate information and technical assistance to those seeking to reduce rates of teen pregnancy   Finally  this legislation supports research on teen pregnancy in communities of color    The Communities of Color Teen Pregnancy Prevention Act of 2007   Community Based Intervention Programs The main emphasis of the bill is on community based intervention programs to prevent teen pregnancy   This section receives the majority of funding provided by the bill for grants for public or non profit private entities to carry out teen pregnancy prevention programs in racial and ethnic or immigrant communities with higher than average teen pregnancy rates  To receive a grant  an applicant could apply one or more of the following strategies to prevent teen pregnancy and STI   s   Promote family communication  especially between parents guardians and children   Educate community members about the consequences of teen pregnancy  or  Provide medically accurate contraceptive information for sexually active teens  or those at high risk for engaging in sexual activity  and talk about the responsibilities of parenthood   This section would also require HHS to fund its own evaluation of six programs funded by grants in this section   This evaluation would provide currently unavailable crucial information about effective messages for communities of color  and puts the responsibility of evaluation on HHS  which has the resources for such an evaluation  not on an individual grantee with limited funds   The bill authorizes  40 million per year for four years for this section   School Based Projects This section provides grants for public and nonprofit private entities to partner with local schools operating in racial and ethnic or immigrant communities with higher than average teen pregnancy rates to   Provide counseling to prevent teen pregnancy and STI   s   Provide training for staff  and  Promote healthy outcomes for pregnant teens   This section acknowledges the importance of supportive school environments for teens to prevent teen pregnancy or prevent subsequent pregnancies   The bill authorizes  10 million per year for four years for this section   Multimedia Campaigns This section provides grants to public and nonprofit private entities for multimedia campaigns to prevent teen pregnancy and STI   s  directed toward racial and ethnic or immigrant communities with higher than average teen pregnancy rates   The bill authorizes  6 million per year for four years for this section     National Clearinghouse for Teen Pregnancy Prevention This section provides grants for a nonprofit entity to establish a National Clearinghouse for Teen Pregnancy Prevention   This Clearinghouse would provide information and assistance to develop content and messages for teens and adults that address teen pregnancy and STI   s   The Clearinghouse must have significant experience and demonstrate cultural and linguistic competency   The bill authorizes  1 5 million per year for four years for this section    Research This section provides grants to public and private nonprofit entities for research on teen pregnancy and STI   s in communities of color  its impact on education and health  and how rates vary by location  ethnicity  and level of acculturation   The bill authorizes  7 5 million per year for four years for this section   General Requirements   All information provided must be age appropriate  factually and medically accurate and complete  and scientifically based   All information and activities must be culturally and linguistically competent                                    ,Obama

Ortiz  202 228 5566   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today sent the following letter to Secretary of Veterans Affairs James Peake  calling on him to investigate reports that a psychologist at a Texas Veterans Affairs  VA  facility told staff members to refrain from diagnosing veterans with post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  in order to reduce costs   According to today s Washington Post  the psychologist  Ms  Norma Perez  apparently emailed Teague Center staff members suggesting the alternative diagnosis to limit the number of tests required to diagnose PTSD   Since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began  thousands of service members have returned home suffering from combat related psychological injuries like PTSD  which require much needed treatment    In the letter  Obama calls on Peake to launch an investigation into the incident to evaluate whether Perez was advised to send this e mail or give this instruction at the urging of her superiors  whether staff members at the Teague Center followed Perez s advice  and if so  how many veterans were affected by incorrect diagnoses  whether officials at other veterans centers have given some similar admonitions to staff members charged with diagnosing PTSD  whether affected veterans have been given immediate re diagnoses and  whether this is an incident or a trend through the VA system    Obama also wrote today to Veterans Affairs  Committee Chairman Daniel Akaka requesting a hearing to examine this matter   The text of the letter is below    Dear Secretary Peake    I am writing to express my serious concerns about reports that a psychologist at a Texas Veterans Affairs  VA  facility told staff members to refrain from diagnosing veterans with post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD     According to today s Washington Post  Norma Perez  a psychologist at the Department of Veterans Affairs  Olin E  Teague Veterans  Center in Temple  Texas  sent an email to other staffers saying    Given that we are having more and more compensation seeking veterans  I d like to suggest that you refrain from giving a diagnosis of PTSD straight out    She then suggested the alternative diagnosis of  Adjustment Disorder   adding that VA staff members  really don t       have time to do the extensive testing that should be done to determine PTSD     Simply put  Ms  Perez s email is outrageous    As you well know  PTSD is the most prevalent mental disorder afflicting our returning Operation Iraqi Freedom  OIF  and Operation Enduring Freedom  OEF  veterans   In order to receive their deserved benefits  these brave men and women must endure a long and arduous process   To hear that a VA official is promoting misdiagnoses of soldiers to save money is unacceptable and is tantamount to fraud    You have said that Ms  Perez s email is  inappropriate   but more must be done   I call on the Department to open an investigation into the following                1  Whether Ms  Perez was advised to send this e mail or give this instruction at the urging of her superiors at the Teague Center                2  Whether staff members at the Teague Center followed Ms  Perez s advice  and if so  how many veterans were affected by incorrect diagnoses                 3  Whether officials at other veterans centers have given some similar admonitions to staff members charged with diagnosing PTSD    4  Whether this is an incident or a trend   I understand that the VA keeps detailed information on the number of diagnoses of PTSD and adjustment disorder  Your investigation must look at changes in the number of both diagnoses over time  both system wide and on a facility by facility basis     5  What is being done to ensure that any veterans affected by this instruction do not fall through the cracks  All veterans given an incorrect diagnosis should be given redress both in their diagnoses and their subsequent disability benefits     6  Whether there are any trends among veterans who have committed suicide recently to determine whether any were wrongly diagnosed with adjustment disorder   Your investigation should include a survey of root cause analyses of recent veteran suicides      7  Whether there are other instances across the VA bureaucracy of veterans with legitimate cases of PTSD being swept under the rug for budgetary reasons or for expediency   Why  for instance is the number of approved benefits claims for PTSD at the Veterans Benefits Administration decreasing at a time when diagnoses for PTSD at the Veterans Health Administration are increasing     Too many veterans see the VA as a bureaucracy with the singular goal of denying services and benefits to veterans  This recent incident merely serves to promote that impression  I request that you advise me by no later than Friday  May 23  2008  as to whether you will open such investigation      Thank you     Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator                               Pursuant to  policy

Veterans Friday  November 16  2007  For Immediate Release  Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Amy Brundage  Obama  Bill will Strengthen Hiring Practices and Quality Control at VA Hospitals WASHINGTON  DC  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced legislation to strengthen hiring practices and improve quality control measures at VA Medical facilities   The Illinois Senators wrote the bill in response to the troubling circumstances at the Marion Veterans Medical Center  VAMC  in southern Illinois which suspended all inpatient surgeries at the hospital on August 31 due to an unusual increase in deaths over a six month period     We don t have all the facts yet about the situation in Marion  but we do know that what happened is unacceptable   During the course of the investigation  four top level executives have been relieved of their post  one surgeon has resigned and subsequently agreed not to practice medicine in the U S  again  and four others have had their privileges restricted         said Durbin  who believes the circumstances at the Marion VAMC may point to greater problems within the VA medical system     Our veterans have made incredible sacrifices for this country  and when they return home we owe them world class health care         Obama said    We are going to get to the bottom of what happened at Marion because the veterans and their families affected by this tragedy deserve to know the facts   This legislation will help ensure situations like this one won t happen at other VA facilities          The Veterans  Health Care Quality Improvement Act is designed to tighten the process for hiring doctors  introduce a new quality assurance mechanism  and attract more quality medical professionals to the VA   The bill would require doctors applying to VA to disclose all past malpractice payments and disciplinary actions against them and any ongoing investigations or outstanding allegations  as well as to send a written request to any state board where they have ever held a license asking that board to disclose this same information to the VA   These measures would likely have stopped the Marion VA hospital from hiring Dr  Veizaga Mendez while the Massachusetts State Medical Board was investigating him for gross incompetence    Today s legislation also calls for a designated doctor  with the appropriate seniority and qualifications  to monitor the quality of the surgeons on staff   This doctor will report directly to the leadership of the hospital but will also report to a similar quality assurance doctor at the regional level   This will ensure that if there is a lapse in leadership at the facility  which appears to have been the case at Marion  a separate avenue is there for employees to express concerns    Finally  the bill proposes incentives to more easily recruit quality doctors to practice in VA facilities  where salaries are often not competitive with private hospitals or private practice   It calls on VA facilities to establish close affiliations with nearby medical schools  proposes to help relieve crushing medical school debt for young doctors willing to practice in a VA hospital and offers incentives to bring more senior doctors into a veterans hospital setting  even if on a flexible or part time basis    Durbin and Obama have worked for nearly two months on the ongoing investigations regarding the care provided in Marion and the hiring of Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez  who was allowed to practice medicine at the facility until August 2007 despite having agreed to no longer practice medicine in Massachusetts after cases of malpractice and disciplinary action   The Department of Veterans Affairs suspended all inpatient surgeries at the Marion VAMC in late August and the VA Inspector General has initiated an investigation   Four top hospital officials at Marion have also been reassigned until an Inspector General investigation is completed   Several times  Durbin and Obama have called on the former Secretary of Veterans  Jim Nicholson and the current Acting VA Secretary  Gordon Mansfield  to respond to information that has come to light regarding patient safety and the quality of care at the Marion VA Medical Center                                   Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other

recent reports of possible security vulnerabilities at O Hare International Airport in Chicago   Earlier this week  reports surfaced suggesting that TSA uniforms and security information were not properly secured within the airport facilities   Because terrorists have attempted to impersonate law enforcement and other security officials in order to gather intelligence  conduct counter

shortcomings in how the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  secures screeners  uniforms at O Hare International Airport in Chicago  As you know  terrorists have attempted to impersonate law enforcement and other security officials in order to gather intelligence  conduct counter surveillance  and even carry out attacks   Considering the extraordinary security threats our nation faces

screeners are employed by private contractors  Can you provide information on how your internal affairs teams test for compliance with these policies   If this information is classified or otherwise restricted  my staff will arrange to receive a briefing with appropriate safeguards in place  Can you provide information on whether your intelligence staff  or the intelligence staff of the Department of Homeland Security or any agency  is concerned about theft of screener uniforms or other items as a terrorist tactic   As with the item above  we can arrange to receive this information in a manner consistent with its sensitivity  Can you confirm whether TSA will in fact perform an investigation of recent events at O Hare  despite some press reports to the contrary   If you will not conduct an investigation  can you articulate why this decision was made   Similarly  if an investigation is to be conducted  can you describe its scope and purpose  As a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  I am committed to doing everything I can to help protect the homeland   My concerns about on site security are not limited to screener uniforms  but extend to other threat items  e g   fake guns  bomb parts  etc    training materials  and other items that are not visible to the traveling public and which  if breached  could provide very useful information to those who wish to do us harm  I know that the more than 40 000 TSA screeners work diligently to screen millions of passengers and bags every day across America  but their efforts will be compromised if seemingly mundane  but still critical security protocols are not followed   Any reassurances you can provide will be very helpful   Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter

following statement on the visit of Polish President Lech Kaczynski to the United States       I welcome Polish President Lech Kaczynski to Washington   Recognizing the rich history of cooperation between our two countries  I am happy to say  Witam Serdecznie w Washingtonie  Welcome to Washington           The Polish President s visit reminds us that for the last 200 years America and Poland have been linked in the struggle for freedom   Today there is a strong legacy of sacrifice between the two nations     sacrifice for the cause of American and Polish freedom alike          As early as the Revolutionary War  Polish patriots like Casimir Pulaski and Tadeusz Kosciuszko fought alongside American patriots     from Germantown to Saratoga     to help win our country   s independence          During World War I  Ignacy Paderewski  an unparalleled musician  helped lead the fight for a free and independent Poland   He became Prime Minister after the war  only to be forced into exile by the Nazi Occupation   After he died in exile in the United States  America gave this great friend of freedom a place alongside our honored dead in Arlington National Cemetery  There he would rest  in the words of President Franklin Roosevelt     until Poland would be free             It was a moving sight when  in 1992  President George H  W  Bush escorted Paderewski s ashes home to Poland   No one will forget seeing thousands of Poles lining the streets over the miles from the airport to the city center  waiting to see the horse drawn carriage          It was the world   s good fortune that a Pole infused with this same dedication to freedom and the dignity of all people was elected Pope at such a critical time   Polish Americans were thrilled at the election of Karol Wojtyla as Pope  a man who kept the faith when faith was forbidden          At the same time  American Polonia   s dedication to freedom in their native Poland was vital in ensuring that Soviet totalitarianism would not succeed   Millions of personal packages were sent to friends and family back home  and each package was a message of hope in dark days     like the imposition of Martial Law in 1981     of the Soviet Union          The razing of the Iron Curtain provided opportunities to renew the linkage between Poland and America   Two centuries after the deaths of Pulaski and Kosciuszko  Poland and America became formal allies in NATO  institutionalizing the faith in freedom our countries have shared for centuries          Since joining NATO in 1997  Poland has become one of America   s most important strategic partners  dedicating troops and resources to our operations in Afghanistan and Iraq          We now have an opportunity to build on this long and deep relationship   Here is how we can      1  Renew the unity of purpose of the Transatlantic Relationship      The Bush Administration s policy of splitting Europe into    old    and    new    was not just wrong  it was counterproductive   Poland should not have to choose between its vital interest in closer integration with Europe and its alliance with the United States   America must repair its relationship with Europe as a whole  so that Poland and our other Central European allies are never put in that position again      2  Finish building a Europe whole and free      Poland has been a steadfast champion of liberty in the countries to its east   America and Poland should stand together to help Ukraine build a strong and stable democracy  and to help the people of Belarus regain their human rights   We also share an interest in working with Russia to meet common security threats and to encourage Russia   s integration into Western institutions   But we should also embrace  not abandon  those in Russia working to preserve their hard won liberty  and draw clear lines against Russia   s intimidation of its neighbors   21st Century Europe cannot be divided into 19th Century spheres of influence     3  Meet global challenges together       Not long ago  we looked to Poland as a country that needed American help in its own efforts to be free and secure  now we look to Poland as a critical partner in building a safer  freer world    We should work with Poland to secure more European troops  with stronger rules of engagement  to stabilize Afghanistan   And we should work together to send an unmistakable signal to Iran that its insistence in pursuing a nuclear weapons program is a profound mistake      4  Energize the alliance to confront new challenges      From Poland to the United States  we are facing a new kind of threat     in the form of energy insecurity and climate change   The North Atlantic community has always joined forces to confront and defeat new challenges  and we should be doing the same now by  among other things  sharing best practices on energy conservation  inviting India and China to join the International Energy Agency  and dedicating our significant resources to establishing a global cap and trade on greenhouse gas pollution      5  Prudently but decisively prepare for emerging threats      The Bush Administration has been developing plans to deploy interceptors and radar systems in Poland and the Czech Republic as part of a missile defense system designed to protect against the potential threat of Iranian nuclear armed missiles   If we can responsibly deploy missile defenses that would protect us and our allies we should     but only when the system works   We need to make sure any missile defense system would be effective before deployment   The Bush Administration has in the past exaggerated missile defense capabilities and rushed deployments for political purposes  The Bush Administration has also done a poor job of consulting its NATO allies about the deployment of a missile defense system that has major implications for all of them   We must not allow this issue to divide    new Europe    and    old Europe     as the Bush Administration tried to do over Iraq       6  Invite Poland to join the Visa Waiver Program      We should work to include countries like Poland that are members of both the EU and NATO into the Visa Waiver Program   Today   s visa regime reflects neither the current strategic relationship nor the close historic bonds between our peoples  and is out of date         These are important steps  and I look forward to working with my colleagues to implement them          It is wonderful to welcome the Polish President at a time in which America and Poland share the same freedom   Our two nations share a common legacy and destiny  and I am honored to welcome President Kaczynski to Washington                                       ,Obama

United States Senate  Committee on Appropriations      123 Hart Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510   Dear Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Cochran  The recent and extraordinary tornadoes  storms  and flooding of the Mississippi River and its tributaries have left many communities devastated in our states  While our first responders  state  and local governments are continuing their heroic effort to provide assistance to our citizens in these areas  our communities are still suffering from the huge losses to homes  businesses  and infrastructure caused by these storms   All of our states face the arduous task of rebuilding  As our state and local governments have begun to calculate their various losses and needs  it is clear that the magnitude of this disaster will require action from the federal government beyond the Stafford Act  Every time a region of our country has been affected by a major disaster we have come together to make sure states do not face disasters alone   These tornadoes  storms  and flooding have affected nine states across the central United States  While each state has unique types of damage  we have joined together in an attempt to ensure that the entire region is able to receive the assistance needed to come out of these disasters stronger  We need to make sure that FEMA  the U S  Army Corps of Engineers  HUD  Commerce  USDA  DOL  DHHS  DOT  and other federal agencies have the necessary resources to save businesses  homes and lives  A robust disaster relief package is necessary to fund the costs that these agencies will incur in the recovery process  Our states have provided the Committee with very initial estimates of funds that will be needed  beyond what FEMA and the Stafford Act will cover  to begin this process  The Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  program is especially important in this regard   We believe this program should provide grants for home repair or replacement  small businesses  and community infrastructure   We urge you to continue to work with us as you consider an additional Supplemental Appropriations measure to ensure critical funding and relief reaches the areas devastated by this disaster   Thank you for your attention to this important matter       Sincerely                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other

establish a national stillbirth registry and promote prevention WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today introduced the Preventing Stillbirth and Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Act of 2008  which will enhance public health activities related to understanding and preventing stillbirth and sudden unexpected infant deaths  SUID   Every year  more than 25 000 women in the United States experience stillbirth and roughly 4 500 infants die as a result of SUID  While some of these deaths are a result of known causes  most stillbirths and SUID remain unexplained  Despite these significant rates  there is not a standardized or consistent process for recording these deaths  which impedes prevention efforts and complicates our ability to understand risk factors related to them  The Obama legislation will standardize and coordinate data and information related to stillbirth and SUID in an effort to improve current prevention strategies for women at risk  as well as facilitate research   Every year  too many American families experience the heartbreak of stillbirth and sudden unexpected infant death  and we must do everything we can to work to prevent these tragedies   said Senator Obama    This important legislation will launch a national registry for both stillbirth and SUID to help facilitate understanding of the root causes  rates  and trends of these deaths   It will also provide every American family with access to information about ways to prevent them  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this legislation to the Senate floor as soon as possible   This Act will enhance public activities related to stillbirth by   Developing a standard definition of stillbirth in consultation with national health organizations and professional societies with expertise relating to reducing stillbirths and infant mortality   Establishing a national registry that can facilitate the understanding of root causes  rates  and trends of stillbirth   Developing and enhancing public education and prevention programs aimed at reducing the occurrence of stillbirth    This Act will enhance public activities related to sudden unexpected infant death by   Establishing a population based SUID case registry that can facilitate the understanding  of the root causes  rates  and trends of SUID   Facilitating the collection  analysis  and dissemination of data by implementing a surveillance and monitoring system based on thorough and complete death scene investigation data  clinical history  and autopsy findings   Collecting standardized information about the environmental  medical  social  and genetic circumstances that may correlate with infant deaths   Establishing a standardized classification system for defining subcategories of SIDS and SUID for surveillance and prevention research activities   Supporting multidisciplinary infant death reviews such as those performed by child death review committees and fetal infant mortality committees to collect and review the standardized information and accurately and consistently classify and characterize SUID   Improving public reporting of surveillance and descriptive epidemiology of SUID by supplementing vital statistics data    First Candle SIDS Alliance applauds this legislation and says    On behalf of the thousands of American families devastated by the sudden  unexpected death of a beloved baby each and every year  First Candle applauds Senator Obama for introducing this groundbreaking bill  Without consistency in defining  investigating and

WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today sent the following letter to Veterans Affairs Secretary James Peake  calling on him to immediately investigate reports that the VA failed to notify veterans about severe side effects from drug testing after the FDA issued a serious warning last November   According to a Washington Times ABC News investigation  more than 1 000 veterans suffering from post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  participated in a study to examine ways to end smoking   143 of the study participants took the anti smoking drug Chantix  which the FDA found lead to side effects  including hallucinations  suicide attempts  and psychotic behavior   Study participants were not notified about the FDA warning until three months later  and were not warned about the drug s most severe side effect   suicide    In the letter Obama calls on Peake to conduct a full and thorough investigation of the process by which VA conducts clinical trials and to take immediate corrective action to address the problems that were first identified by GAO eight years ago     The text of the letter is below     Dear Secretary Peake  I was very concerned to read this morning s Washington Times and learn that the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  has yet again failed to take appropriate steps to safeguard the health and well being of veterans participating in drug trials  According to a Washington Times ABC News investigation  the VA took three months to notify patients about severe side effects from the anti smoking drug Chantix   Almost 1 000 veterans suffering from post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  were paid  30 a month to participate in a study examining ways to end smoking   A total of 143 of the study participants took the anti smoking drug Chantix  Last November  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  issued an alert regarding reports that Chantix led to hallucinations  suicide attempts  and psychotic behavior   Even though almost 40 suicides and more than 400 examples of suicidal behavior were eventually attributed to Chantix nationwide  the VA waited three months after the FDA advisory to alert its study participants about the mental health risks of the drug   And when the VA did finally notify study participants  it failed to mention the most serious side effects of suicide and suicidal thoughts   According to the Washington Times ABC News investigation  21 veterans have reported adverse effects from Chantix   In addition to Chantix  the VA is testing other drugs on veterans with PTSD that carry warnings of suicidal side effects  I understand that clinical research is a vital mission of the VA   Clinical research is not only a source of new treatments for veterans but also a way to recruit and retain the nation s best doctors   However  as I am sure you would agree  the VA has a special responsibility to maintain the most rigorous standards when conducting research on such a vulnerable population   These trials should only be conducted when VA fully informs patients of the risks of the drugs they are taking  and adequately monitors the patients for side effects   These requirements are especially important when dealing with vulnerable patients such as veterans suffering from PTSD  Unfortunately  the lack of protections for participants in clinical trials is a longstanding problem at VA   Following the suspension of all research at the Veterans Affairs of Greater Los Angeles Health Care System in 1999  the Government Accountability Office  GAO  identified numerous problems in the way that human research subjects were treated at VA facilities  including  failures to provide adequate information to subjects before they participated in research     In a follow up investigation in June 2003  GAO found that  VA has not taken sufficient action to strengthen protections for human subjects since we made our recommendations nearly 3 years ago  and that  VA has not established a mechanism for handling adverse event reports to ensure that  Institutional Review Boards  have the information they need to safeguard the rights and welfare of human research participants   It is outrageous and unacceptable that our government would irresponsibly endanger veterans who have already sacrificed so much for our country   Our veterans   particularly those suffering from mental health injuries   should have the very best health care and support in the world   They should never be needlessly exposed to drugs without proper notification of the dangers involved or effective monitoring of the side effects      It is distressing that our government could once again let down our veterans and their families who have given so much to their country   It is time to demand accountability and to ensure that this kind of breach of trust never takes place again   Accordingly  I call on you to conduct a full and thorough investigation of the process by which VA conducts clinical trials and to take immediate corrective action to address the problems that were first identified by GAO eight years ago    I ask that you notify my office by Friday  June 20  2008  as to whether you will order such an investigation   Thank you    Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other

  Key Report Highlights Advantages of Insuring Adults   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Key Report Highlights Advantages of Insuring Adults Wednesday  May 16  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Jude McCartin  Bingaman  202 224 1804 WASHINGTON     A dozen Senators today said they would fight to ensure states are allowed to keep the flexibility to cover adults through the State Children   s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  when that program is reauthorized later this year   Citing a report by the respected Kaiser Family Foundation  the Senators pointed out that SCHIP coverage of parents leads to improved healthcare coverage of children   It also plays an important role in filling a coverage gap for adults and pregnant women who otherwise would not have access to insurance    Eleven states have received waivers to cover adults through SCHIP and or Medicaid  Minnesota  Rhode Island  Arizona  Illinois  New Jersey  Wisconsin  Arkansas  Idaho  Nevada  New Mexico and Oregon    Senator Barack Obama     SCHIP   s expansion to cover Illinois parents has allowed 55 000 more children to gain access to health care coverage   We know what works in Illinois  and we must guarantee continued state flexibility as we reauthorize SCHIP to ensure families can keep their health insurance coverage   Repealing adult coverage could cause over 200 000 Illinois parents to lose their coverage and have a ripple effect on coverage for children    Senator Jeff Bingaman     More than 45 million Americans already lack health insurance   Any actions we take in re writing SCHIP should reduce that number  not add to it   SCHIP has always been about flexibility  and it would be a mistake for the federal government to tell my state it can   t cover adults     Bingaman is a member of the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee   Senator Richard Durbin     When parents are covered  they are more likely to enroll their children in a health insurance plan   Illinois is one of eleven states that offer parents health coverage under SCHIP  and our state has seen an increase in the number of children covered   Allowing other states to do what Illinois has done is one of the best ways to ensure we provide quality health care to the nine million uninsured children in America      Senator Russ Feingold     SCHIP is critical to thousands of adults enrolled in BadgerCare  Wisconsin   s program to provide health care coverage for uninsured families   Eliminating adult coverage would hurt tens of thousands of expectant mothers and parents of children enrolled in Medicaid and SCHIP      Senator Amy Klobuchar     This is yet another example of states leading the way on crucial issues and the federal government playing catch up  States shouldn   t be penalized for successfully lowering the number of uninsured children and adults and the SCHIP Reauthorization bill should maintain the state   s flexibility to expand coverage to uninsured people      Senator Herb Kohl     Wisconsin   s program  BadgerCare  has used the SCHIP funds to extend coverage to hundreds of thousands of children and parents since 1997  Currently  our state   s program serves over 66 000 individuals and has won praise from policy makers and beneficiaries alike for its efficiency and ease of use  That is why we need to work in a bipartisan matter to reauthorize SCHIP  before it expires at the end of September      Senator Blanche Lincoln  a member of the Senate Finance Committee     Along with Medicaid  SCHIP has served an invaluable role in reducing the ranks of our nation   s uninsured   While covering the millions of children who remain uninsured should be our top priority  we also have to recognize that state flexibility in covering adult populations can be very beneficial   For example  expanding SCHIP coverage to pregnant women can significantly improve the health of hundreds of thousands of infants born each year  and expanding coverage to parents not only serves to cover additional insured individuals  but also increases the likelihood that they will take the steps necessary to enroll their children      Senator Robert Menendez     I have seen ample evidence in my home state of New Jersey of the importance of SCHIP coverage     not only for some of our neediest children  but for their parents as well  As coverage for parents increases  so does coverage for children  We will continue to fight in the Senate to maintain SCHIP coverage for adults so that many in our country who need health care the most are able to get it      Senator Mark Pryor    Federal dollars from SCHIP can help bridge critical health care services to low income workers   Arkansas has made an important effort to improve access to health care for working adults  and I want to make sure my state continues to have the flexibility to address the problem of the uninsured      Senator Harry Reid     All the evidence demonstrates that through covering parents  we are better able to reach the children who are eligible but not enrolled in the program   It is a sad fact that there are currently 6 million children who are not enrolled in SCHIP or Medicaid even though they are eligible for one of those programs   Reaching out to parents helps us reach and cover those children      Senator Ken Salazar        Right now  Colorado   s CHIP program  CHP   not only covers more than 50 000 kids  but also provides 1 300 pregnant women with pre natal care that promotes the health and well being of infants and saves scarce resources by preventing premature births as well as infant and childhood illnesses and disabilities  This is a good example of the kind of flexibility that states can pursue under CHIP    My staff and I recently held meetings across Colorado with local health care professionals on the State Children   s Health Insurance Program  they all agree that SCHIP and programs like it are largely successful in helping cover children  and we need to build on these successes with insight and ideas from other states       Senator Sheldon Whitehouse     Thousands of Rhode Islanders have health insurance thanks to RIteCare and the federal SCHIP funds that support it   With tens of millions of Americans lacking health coverage  it doesn   t make sense to deny these families the care they depend on as they   re struggling to stay afloat    I applaud Senator Jack Reed   s strong leadership on this issue and will be proud to join him to fight to ensure this program has the flexibility it needs     Whitehouse is a cosponsor of legislation offered by Senators John Rockefeller  D W V   and Olympia Snowe  R Maine  that would support SCHIP   s flexibility in offering coverage to adults                                    ,Obama

                     Obama Calls on Mukasey to Address Racial Discrimination  Protecting Civil Rights Wednesday  October 17  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to Attorney General Designate  Judge Michael Mukasey  asking him how he intends to protect the civil rights of all Americans if he is confirmed Attorney General   In recent years  there has been a systematic failure by the Department of Justice to exhibit any significant commitment to upholding civil rights     particularly in the cases of the photo identification requirement for voting in Georgia  the Jena 6 in Louisiana  the death of a young man at a boot camp in Florida  and concerns that minorities have been steered into high cost subprime loans  In the letter  Obama requests Mukasey   s commitment to enhancing voting rights  enforcing the Voting Rights Act  ending racial profiling  and reversing the politicization of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice  The text of the letter is below  Dear Judge Mukasey   I write to you at a moment in our nation   s history that is fraught with unprecedented legal challenges and constitutional questions     a moment that highlights the extraordinary importance of the position for which you have been nominated   By all accounts  your distinguished legal career reflects a commitment to our Constitution and the rule of law   Unfortunately  this Administration     and your predecessors as Attorney General     have a poor track record in the area of investigating discrimination against racial minorities  while inexplicably focusing resources on a few  exceptional cases involving white victims   From attempts in Georgia to enact a voter identification requirement to the Jena 6 case in Louisiana to concerns that minorities have been steered into high cost subprime loans  we have seen a systematic failure by the Department of Justice to exhibit any significant commitment to upholding civil rights    At such a critical time in our nation   s history  we need an Attorney General determined to protect the rights of all Americans     in particular  those traditionally disadvantaged     and not someone who views his mission as serving as the President   s personal attorney   Since I am not a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  I will not have the opportunity today to ask you questions about your views on civil rights  For that reason  I ask that you provide responses to the following questions  1   In recent years  the Department of Justice has demonstrated a clear preference for investigating isolated examples of voter fraud  rather than more widespread allegations of disenfranchisement of minority voters   As Attorney General  will you commit to a program of enforcement that is aimed at enhancing  rather than diminishing  the ability of racial and ethnic minorities to vote   Will you commit to applying the Voting Rights Act to challenge voter identification laws such as those attempted in Georgia and other states    2   The Department of Justice seems to have weakened its stance on the enforcement of apparent racial profiling cases under 42 U S C 14141  which allows for civil lawsuits to be brought by the Department against racial profiling by our nation   s police departments   Will you commit to opening investigations and pursuing lawsuits against police departments that reveal a pattern or practice of police misconduct    3   In recent months  our nation   s attention has been focused on the racial strife in Jena  Louisiana  and the disparate treatment of six African American youths   As Attorney General  will you commit the investigative resources of the Civil Rights Division to ensuring the fair treatment and execution of the law in cases such as the Jena 6  as well as the recent acquittal by an all white jury of eight prison guards accused of killing a young black male at a juvenile detention center in Florida  4   Several studies have found that black and Hispanic borrowers were more likely to be steered into high cost subprime loans than other borrowers  even after controlling for factors such as income  loan size  and property location   Although multiple concerns have been raised in recent years about discrimination in the housing market  the number of housing cases filed by the Housing and Civil Enforcement Section has fallen from 53 in 2001 to 31 in 2006  and cases involving discrimination have fallen by 60    In 2003  the Justice Department announced that it would no longer file disparate impact cases involving housing discrimination     a sharp break from DOJ   s longstanding and bipartisan policy to aggressively litigate these cases   In light of recent reports of stark racial disparities in the subprime lending market and the sharp drop in housing discrimination enforcement actions  what steps will you take to ensure that the nation s housing discrimination laws are vigorously enforced   Will you commit the Housing and Civil Enforcement Division to investigating whether the practices of the mortgage lending industry violate the Equal Credit Opportunity Act  Fair Housing Act  or other federal antidiscrimination statutes  5   In 2002  the Bush Administration placed political appointees in charge of hiring new attorneys in the Civil Rights Division     departing from the longstanding practice of giving this hiring authority to career professionals   Since then  less than half of new hires in the Division   s important Appellate  Employment Litigation  and Voting Sections have had any prior civil rights experience     and less than a quarter have had any prior experience enforcing the nation   s civil rights laws   The others  according to a Boston Globe analysis     gained their experience either by defending employers against discrimination lawsuits or by fighting against race conscious policies      Will you pledge to restore professionalism and end the practice of politicized hires within the Civil Rights Division   What specific steps will you take to reverse these trends in hiring  6  What is your opinion of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act  which I introduced in January 2007 and which recently passed the Senate Judiciary Committee   Do you agree that this legislation is necessary  I believe that with the proper leadership  the Department of Justice can reclaim its historical leadership role in

Calls on Blackwater to Testify Before Senate Monday  October 15  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                 CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 Calls on Prince to testify  Release details of Iraq contract  WASHINGTON  D C      Today  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  called on Chairman Joseph Lieberman and Ranking Member Susan Collins of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to ask Erik Prince  the head of Blackwater  to testify before the Committee and provide details of the company   s contract in Iraq  In February  Obama offered the Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act  S  674   a comprehensive piece of legislation requiring more information and accountability on private security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan  The Senate passed an Obama amendment in the Defense Department Authorization bill that will require federal departments to compile and report information to Congress on the role of contractors in Iraq  Obama has also introduced a separate bill  S  2147  to require private contractors to be held accountable under federal law    Below is a copy of the letter  October 15  2007  The Honorable Joseph I  Lieberman  Chairman   The Honorable Susan Collins  Ranking Member  Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs   Washington  DC 20510  Dear Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins   As you know  on September 16  2007  personnel from Blackwater USA  a private security contracting firm  killed as many as 17 Iraqi civilians in an incident in Baghdad   This incident  which has damaged the United States    reputation in the eyes of the Iraqi people  has highlighted the need for more oversight of our government   s use of contractors in Iraq   I am writing to request that the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hold hearings on the proper role of private security contractors  as well as the September 16 incident  Earlier this month  Erik Prince  the head of Blackwater  testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform   At that hearing  Chairman Waxman decided not to ask Mr  Prince specific questions about the September 16 incident out of deference to a pending FBI investigation   However  in two interviews broadcast yesterday  Mr  Prince provided a detailed accounting of what he believes happened that day  asserting that Blackwater guards were fired upon  despite evidence to the contrary  On CNN   s    Late Edition     Mr  Prince suggested that Blackwater   s actions are dictated by the State Department        W e send professionals over there to do a job we do  dictated by the U S  government  by the State Department who hires us   We recruit  vet  equip  train and deploy them  and then we turn them over to the operational control to the U S  government         T hey dictate the missions  they dictate the vehicles  they provide the weapons  they tell us where to go and what to do     Mr  Prince also said that he welcomed greater scrutiny of Blackwater   s operations   On CBS       60 Minutes     Mr  Prince said      We absolutely want more oversight   We welcome the accountability   We want a good name for this industry      Given Mr  Prince   s willingness to submit to additional oversight  as well as the importance of these issues to our ongoing effort in Iraq  I request that you invite Mr  Prince to testify before our Committee  Although the House Oversight Committee shed some light on Blackwater   s practices and the State Department   s relationship with Blackwater  there are still many issues involving Blackwater that merit further oversight   These issues include   the lack of transparency associated with the hiring and conduct of private security contractors  the lack of accountability over their actions  the State Department   s role in covering up previous incidents in which Blackwater guards shot at Iraqi civilians  and the impact of the contractors    behavior on our efforts to win hearts and minds in Iraq and Afghanistan   All of these issues  I believe  merit further investigation by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee    In preparation for such a hearing  I believe it would be prudent to request a copy of the contract that Blackwater received from the State Department to conduct its mission   According to press accounts  that contract was awarded without competition from multiple bidders   Moreover  there remain questions about the rules of engagement under which Blackwater contractors operate in Iraq  including a belief that State Department contractors operate under rules of engagement that are more permissive than those under which Defense Department contractors operate  Given the military   s increased reliance on such private security contractors  greater oversight from our Committee would be both timely and important to ensuring that we understand not just what mistakes have been made  but how we can correct them in a way that protects our national interest   I thank you in advance for your consideration of my request       Sincerely     Barack Obama  United States Senator                                   ,Obama

               CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 Despite urgent housing needs  Administration intends to drastically reduce federal housing in New Orleans WASHINGON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to President Bush  calling on him to abandon his Administration   s intentions to demolish federally assisted housing in New Orleans  Louisiana until there is a comprehensive plan to meet the Gulf Coast region   s extensive affordable housing needs   Despite an estimated 12 000 people already homeless in New Orleans  and thousands more struggling with costly and slow rebuilding efforts since Hurricane Katrina  the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  is now planning to reduce the limited supply of affordable housing even further by demolishing 4 500 units of public housing   Over the past two years  the Bush Administration has consistently failed Gulf Coast residents  and should not further exacerbate this tragic housing crisis by destroying affordable housing    The text of the letter is below  Dear Mr  President    I urge you to abandon all plans to demolish federally assisted housing in New Orleans  Louisiana until there is a comprehensive plan to meet the region s extensive affordable housing needs      Two years ago  when you appeared in Jackson Square  you spoke of America s    duty to confront this poverty with bold action     You explained      Americans want the Gulf Coast not just to survive  but to thrive  not just to cope  but to overcome   We want evacuees to come home  for the best of reasons    because they have a real chance at a better life in a place they love        Unfortunately  there are an estimated 12 000 people already homeless in New Orleans  and thousands more are struggling with costly and slow rebuilding efforts and private rents that have risen 45  since the storm   More than two thirds of the housing stock was destroyed by the hurricane  and much of it has not yet been rebuilt   Thousands of residents are still living in trailers with dangerous levels of formaldehyde even though more than 800 days have passed since Hurricane Katrina made landfall     Despite this harsh reality  the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  is now planning to reduce the limited supply of affordable housing even further by demolishing 4 500 units of public housing   Notwithstanding your wish for evacuees to come home to    thrive    and    overcome     New Orleans does not have adequate affordable housing options even for the people who are already there         It is critical for policy makers to answer the following questions before any demolition takes place     Is demolition  which was originally planned and approved before hurricane Katrina  still a sensible strategy in light of the region s housing crisis   How many new units of public housing will be built or acquired to replace the 4 500 scheduled for demolition   If less than 4 500  what is the plan to close the gap to get back at least to pre Katrina levels   If more than 4 500  what plans are in place to ensure adequate income diversity and economic integration    What plans are in place to meet the low income housing needs during the period between demolition and the availability of new housing    What supports are in place to assist residents during any housing transition   Almost a year ago  I visited New Orleans and posed similar questions to HUD   I have yet to receive an adequate response to that inquiry    There is no question that most displaced residents want to come back to their homes and apartments  but that is hardly possible if they return to a city with fewer affordable housing options available than it had before   I support the conversion to mixed income neighborhoods and greater economic integration  but such redevelopment plans must not be at the expense of adequate and improved housing options for the poor   No public housing should be demolished until HUD can point to an equivalent number of replacement units in the near vicinity      Over the past two years  the federal government has failed the people of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast   But there is still an opportunity to demonstrate that they are not forgotten   I urge you to reconsider the demolition of these housing units until there is a comprehensive plan to meet the region s extensive affordable housing needs   Thank you      Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator                                Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls

  Obama Statement on Senate Debate Over Redeploying U S  Troops from Iraq   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Statement on Senate Debate Over Redeploying U S  Troops from Iraq Wednesday  July 18  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Ben LaBolt       WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement on the all night Senate debate over redeploying U S  troops from Iraq   Obama is a co sponsor of the Levin Reed amendment and the sponsor of the Iraq De Escalation Act   The text is below     We have heard from the Administration and from many of our colleagues in this chamber that we need to give the President s surge more time  that we need to wait to hear the report in September before we make a binding decision to redeploy our troops   Yet  we learned just last week that the Iraqi political leaders have not met a single benchmark that they had agreed to in January   Not one                          We do not need to wait for another report  We have seen the results of a failed policy in the form of multiple deployments  more sacrifice from our military families  and a deepening civil war in Iraq that has caught our troops in the middle             It is long past time to turn the page in Iraq  where each day we see the consequences of fighting a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged   The single most important decision a President or Member of Congress can make is the decision to send our troops into harm s way              It is that decision that determines the fate of our men and women in uniform  the course of nations  and the security of the American people   It is that decision that sets in motion consequences that cannot be undone             Since this war began  3 618 Americans have been killed     532 since the President ignored the will of the American people and launched his surge   Tens of thousands more have been wounded  suffering terrible injuries seen and unseen                         Here is what else we know   We know that the surge is not working  that our mission in Iraq must be changed  and that this war must be brought to a responsible conclusion             We know Iraq s leaders are not resolving their grievances   They are not stepping up to their security responsibilities   They are not improving the daily lives of Iraqis             We know that the war in Iraq costs us  370 million dollars a day and  10 billion each month   These are resources that could be spent to secure our ports and our borders  and to focus on a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan and the wider war on terrorism that is yet to be won             We know that because of the war in Iraq  America is no safer than it was on 9 11   Al Qaeda has gained the best recruiting tool it could ask for   Tens of thousands of terrorists have been trained and radicalized in Iraq   And terrorism is up worldwide          If America is attacked again  it will be in no small measure a consequence of our failure to destroy al Qaeda at its roots in Afghanistan and our failure to adequately secure the homeland   The decision to authorize and fight a misguided war in Iraq has created a new cadre of experienced terrorists bent on the destruction of the United States and our allies          If there   s still any question about whether Iraq has been a distraction from this critical war in Afghanistan and Pakistan  that should have been resolved yesterday with the release of the most recent National Intelligence Estimate    That report said that al Qaeda    has protected or regenerated key elements of its Homeland attack capability  including  a safe haven in the Pakistan Federally Administered Tribal Areas  operational lieutenants  and its top leadership          And last week  a new threat assessment concluded that al Qaeda is as strong today as it was before 9 11          Seeing yet another report like this  I can only repeat what I said nearly five years ago  during the run up to this war   We are fighting on the wrong battlefield   The terrorists who attacked us and who continue to plot against us are resurgent in the hills between Afghanistan and Pakistan   They should have been our focus then   They must be our focus now          I opposed this war from the beginning  before the Congress voted to authorize the war in 2002   I said then that I could not support a war based not on reason but on passion  not on principle but on politics   I worried that it would lead to a US occupation of undetermined length  at undetermined cost  with undetermined consequences          I believed then     and I still believe now     that being a leader means that you d better do what s right and leave the politics aside   Because there are no do overs on an issue as important as war   You cannot undo the consequences of that decision         In January  I introduced a plan that would have already started bringing our troops home and ending this war  with a goal of removing all combat brigades by March 31  2008  Seventy eight days ago  President Bush vetoed a bipartisan plan that passed both houses of Congress that shared my goal of changing course and ending this war          During those 78 days  266 Americans have died  and the situation in Iraq has continued to deteriorate         It   s time to set a hard date to signal a new mission in Iraq and to begin to bring our troops home   It   s time to ensure that we complete the change in mission and the drawdown of our forces  by the end of April 2008     a date that is consistent with the date in my plan back in January          As we redeploy from Iraq     as I believe we must do     we have to redouble our efforts on all fronts in Afghanistan to ensure we do not lose ground there          Certainly  we   ve had some success there over the last five and half years  whether it   s the five fold increase in the number of Afghan boys and girls now attending schools or the free elections of a president and parliament          Yet the remaining challenges in Afghanistan are enormous   Opium production is expected to reach a record high this year  with revenues helping to fuel the Taliban and al Qaeda   The Taliban has increased its campaign of suicide attacks and roadside bombings in recent months   Most troubling  Mr  President  is this simple fact   The leaders of Al Qaeda     Osama bin Laden and his lieutenant Ayman Al Zawahiri     and the leader of the Taliban  Mullah Omar  remain at large   They are now free to operate in a safe haven in northwest Pakistan   That has to change          First  the United States must increase reconstruction efforts  on both the civilian and military side   If we are serious about winning the war on terror  we must shift to greater investments in winning the hearts and minds of Afghans   The U S  should allocate money in a way that allows more flexibility in our spending  permitting funding of local projects that benefit communities and promising local governments          Second  the U S  and NATO must turn around the security situation so that average Afghans regain their faith in the ability of their government and the international forces to ensure their security   Despite more than five years of an international military presence in their country  the sad reality is that most Afghans do not believe their government can guarantee their safety

a serious risk to Illinois  agriculture industry  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today asked for a meeting with the Secretary of Agriculture  Ed Schafer  to discuss damage assessments  options available to affected communities and plans for a coordinated federal response in the region     Though experts continue to assess the extent of the impact  it s clear that the recent flood waters have caused substantial damage  inundating farmland and destroying rural homes  businesses  and facilities   The floods of 1993 floods incurred more than  15 billion in damage   the Senators wrote    Therefore  we request that you make the necessary declarations to ensure that our producers and rural communities have access to all appropriate sources of federal disaster assistance   In addition  we ask that you compile a list of programs that producers and rural communities may be eligible for     Earlier today  in an effort to ensure a coordinated federal response  Durbin and Obama joined a bipartisan group of twelve senators from six Midwestern states in asking for supplemental funding that will enable the Federal Emergency Management Agency  the Army Corps of Engineers  the Department of Housing and Urban Development  the Department of Commerce  the Department of Agriculture  the Small Business Administration and other federal agencies to access the necessary resources to deliver critical relief to the affected areas as soon as possible  text of letter below   June 18  2008  The Honorable Ed Schafer  Secretary  U S  Department of Agriculture  1400 Independence Ave   S W   Washington  DC 20250   Dear Secretary Schafer  We write to request your assistance in responding to the severe flooding in Illinois that has occurred over the past two weeks and an opportunity to meet with you to discuss this issue   Though experts continue to assess the extent of the impact  it s clear that the recent flood waters have caused substantial damage  inundating farmland and destroying rural homes  businesses  and facilities   The floods of 1993 floods incurred more than  15 billion in damage    It s likely that the recent flooding will result in reduced yields in Illinois and significant losses to Illinois  agriculture industry   Because many of our growers planted their crops only days or weeks before the flooding began  crops were highly vulnerable to adverse weather conditions   Many fields of corn  soybean  wheat  and hay have been deluged and crops have been lost   The same is true of acreage planted to specialty crops and certain varieties of fruit trees   Lastly  the timing of the flooding has prevented many growers from entering their fields to plant this year s crop   If wet weather conditions continue to persist  some growers may not be able to plant or re plant a crop in time   The threat to Illinois farmland has only increased in recent days  with levees overtopping in Mercer  Henderson  and Adams counties that protect significant amounts of agricultural lands  Beyond the effects on agriculture  the flooding has devastated communities and damaged homes  businesses  and critical public infrastructure in rural parts of Illinois   As floodwaters begin to recede in other parts of the Midwest  water levels in Illinois along the Mississippi River are expected to crest this week near or above the records set by the devastating floods in 1993   Due to existing damage from rising floodwaters and in anticipation of the widespread damage expected this week  Governor Blagojevich has issued state disaster declarations for Adams  Calhoun  Clark  Coles  Crawford  Cumberland  Douglas  Hancock  Henderson  Jasper  Jersey  Knox  Lake  Lawrence  Madison  Mercer  Pike  Rock Island and Winnebago counties    Unfortunately  the predicted impact of this flooding is greater than the capacity of state or local governments to respond to a disaster of this size   Therefore  we request that you make the necessary declarations to ensure that our producers and rural communities have access to all appropriate sources of federal disaster assistance   In addition  we ask that you compile a list of programs that producers and rural communities may be eligible for  including the Risk Management Agency  RMA  Prevented Planning Program  Farm Service Agency  FSA  Disaster Assistance Programs  and Rural Housing  Community Facilities  and Businesses Emergency Relief  Lastly  we ask that you meet with us in the near future to discuss damage assessments and options available to our communities   We thank you in advance for your timely consideration of this urgent request and stand ready to assist in any way appropriate                                     Pursuant to  policy  newsletters

  Avian Flu Press Conference   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Avian Flu Press Conference Tuesday  November  1  2005  Remarks of Senator Barack Obama  Washington  DC   It has now been more than one year since the government first released its draft Pandemic Influenza Response and Preparedness Plan    In that year  we have witnessed the relentless spread of avian flu from Southeast Asia to Western China  from Russia to the European continent     Just yesterday  we learned that it may have come even closer to home     Ducks in seven Canadian provinces have now tested positive for avian flu   If further tests do indeed show that they are carrying the H5N1 strain  it is only a matter of weeks before a migrating bird brings this deadly disease to our front door     121 people have already contracted the avian flu from infected birds   Sixty two have lost their lives   And if the virus ever mutates so that it can be passed from human to human  we will face global pandemic influenza that may kill millions    Forty countries now have pandemic preparedness plans  but until today  the United States was not one of them     Countries like Japan  France  England  and others have now stockpiled enough Tamiflu to cover a quarter of their populations   With enough to cover just two percent of our population  the United States is again not one of these countries     We find this unacceptable  and so we are encouraged by the President s decision today to join the efforts we ve been pursuing in Congress to combat the avian flu for nearly a year   But we must do more to prevent this pandemic   Much more         Mr  President  the United States cannot afford to have a Katrina level of preparedness or a Katrina like response to an international outbreak of Avian flu   With so many warnings and so much knowledge of the threat we face  there is no excuse for failure this time around     The President said today that this pandemic would require  the immediate attention of the United States Congress so we can have the resources in place to begin implementing this strategy right away     The good news is that many of us in Congress did not wait for the President to schedule a speech   Instead  we have already acted to ensure that our country is not left behind    In March  I requested  25 million in funding for greater global partnership  with the creation of an international council and more surveillance   This is money being used to prevent the flu right now      The President said he was going to send the Congress a funding request for  7 1 billion dollars for avian flu preparedness at home   But fortunately  the resources are already there     In September  we successfully secured  3 9 billion in funding  and just last week I worked with Senator Harkin and others to increase that number to  7 9 billion    In the AVIAN Act of 2005  which I introduced in April  I laid out a number of steps that were echoed by the President today   However  the legislation went a few steps further   Obviously we haven t seen the written plan just yet  but I do want to point out a few additional areas that should be part of this Administration s plan     First  the plan does not lay out a clear chain of command in the event of a crisis   It is unclear whether the Department of Homeland Security or the Department of Health and Human Services will lead the response effort  but we have all seen during Katrina how important a clear chain of command is  and so the President should clarify this     Second  the plan s outreach and avian flu educational efforts seem limited to those with the ability to visit the government s website   The Senate included  75 million for an aggressive outreach campaign to the American public  and the President should do the same    Third  the President s proposed investment in the stockpiling of antivirals may fall short of what is ultimately needed   In the Senate we allocated an additional  2 billion to cover half of the American population   More will be needed if we are to prevent a pandemic    The President s proposal allocates money differently   he uses more money for the development of cell based vaccines   While this is good  again  more funding is needed to ensure we have the antiviral medicine our country needs    Fourth  it is unclear how much assistance the federal government is willing to provide already cash strapped states to strengthen their fragile health infrastructures   The Senate appropriations bill provides  600 million to bolster the public health infrastructure   We should keep this figure    Finally  the President s plan does not request funding for contingency planning and surge capacity for hospitals   The Senate provides  750 million to help doctors and hospitals expand their services and care for more patients in case of pandemic     The devastation wrought by the hurricanes of the last few months has shown us that we cannot stop the forces of nature   But as the wealthiest country on Earth  we can prepare  and we can respond in a way that saves as many lives as possible     We must do that now with the Avian Flu     We are encouraged that the Administration has finally released its preparedness plan  and we look forward to working with them on implementing the strongest version possible as soon as possible                                     ,Obama

                         Obama Calls on Gates to Ensure All Service Members Receive Full Educational Benefits Wednesday  October 17  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 Urges Gates to Consider Waivers to Get National Guard and Reservists Benefits They Deserve   WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates  expressing concerns that some members of the National Guard and Reserves are being denied educational benefits they deserve after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan   Members of the National Guard and Reserves are required to serve for 730 days in order to receive the education benefits earned by those who serve in active duty   However  according to news reports  many returning National Guard and Reservists have discovered that they will not receive these benefits either because their service fell a few days short of 730 days  or because their service orders were issued for a few days less than 730 days  In the letter  Obama  a member of the Senate Veterans    Affairs Committee  calls on Gates to clarify the Department   s authority to provide waivers for these service members  evaluate how widespread the problem is  and propose recommendations to resolve this problem     The fact that those men and women in the National Guard and Reserves who put their lives on the line to serve their country are being denied full educational benefits is simply wrong  and we need to fix this problem today     Senator Obama said      Like members of our military serving in active duty  service members in National Guard and Reserve leave their families  and risk life and limb for our country   There is no reason that they should have to fight this kind of bureaucratic mess to be able to access the benefits they deserve when they come home   I urge Secretary Gates to address this issue as soon as possible and consider any options that will allow us to fully keep promise to these heroes and their families     Below is a copy of the letter     October 16  2007 The Honorable Robert M  Gates  Secretary of Defense  The Pentagon  Washington  D C  20301 1000 Dear Secretary Gates   As you know  in many cases  members of the National Guard and Reserves are required to serve for 730 days in order to receive the level of educational benefits afforded to their active duty counterparts   However  according to recent news accounts  a number of returning service members have discovered that they will not receive these benefits either because they served a few days less than 730 days  or because their service orders were issued for a few days less than 730 days    I believe that these members of the National Guard and Reserves are being unfairly treated  and I ask that you exercise some flexibility and  where appropriate  grant waivers from this service requirement for educational benefits  This problem is just one challenge presented by the complexity of the current maze of educational benefits and the varying eligibility requirements facing our returning service members   Even as Congress works to update these benefits  slash red tape  and ensure fairness and equity for our service members  I would ask that you respond to these interim questions   What statutory authority  if any  does the Department of Defense currently have to provide waivers for those cases in which members of the Guard or Reserves have fulfilled their commitment to serve our nation but have fallen short of receiving benefits that are due to their active duty counterparts   What plans are underway to review orders issued since 9 11 to Guard members and Reservists to determine how widespread this problem is  and does the Pentagon plan to provide waivers for these cases   If so  what would be the military   s threshold for time served in order to grant the more generous educational benefit to members of the Guard and Reserves until the law can be revised   What legislative changes would the Department recommend to correct the inequities in the eligibility criteria for educational benefits for our service members   While there are different views of the war in our country  I know there is no disagreement about the tremendous sacrifice being made by the men and women who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan   They have performed valiantly under exceedingly difficult circumstances   They have done everything that we have asked of them   And at a minimum  we owe them educational benefits that are understandable  accessible  and are commensurate with their noble service   For that reason  I ask that you exercise some degree of flexibility in addressing cases of Guard and Reserve members who have fallen a few

                 Obama Introduces Bill to Halt  Review Military Personality Disorder Discharges Thursday  July 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt  Would institute moratorium to ensure service members are receiving VA benefits they are owed WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced legislation to temporarily suspend the Pentagon   s use of personality disorder discharges after receiving broad  bipartisan support for an identical amendment he proposed to the Defense Authorization bill   The bill would institute a moratorium on discharge procedures until they are thoroughly reviewed and an independent review board is established  Senators Bond  D MO   Boxer  D CA   Lieberman  I CT   McCaskill  D MO    Murray  D WA   Durbin  D IL   Johnson  D SD   Sanders  I VT   and Whitehouse joined as co sponsors      With thousands of American service members suffering from service connected psychological injuries  reports of the Department of Defense improperly diagnosing service members with personality disorders are troubling  especially when the VA benefits owed to our service members are at stake     said Senator Obama      This legislation will force the Department of Defense to suspend its use of this discharge procedure until Secretary Gates can conduct a comprehensive review of these policies and establish a review board to evaluate questionable cases   It is our moral obligation to ensure that all of our returning service members receive the treatment  care  and benefits they deserve   Meeting this obligation is one thing we can still get right about this war     Recent reports suggest that in some cases the Department of Defense  DOD  has inappropriately and inconsistently used these procedures to discharge members of the armed forces with service connected injuries such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  and Traumatic Brain Injuries  TBIs   Those discharges can result in the loss of healthcare benefits from the VA as well as the repayment of enlistment bonuses  which can send injured service members and their families into debilitating debt   Senator Obama originally offered this bipartisan legislation as an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill   And on June 21  2007  Obama joined Senator Bond  Boxer  Lieberman  McCaskill  Murray  and twenty five other Democratic and Republican senators who wrote to Secretary Gates to express concern over continuing reports that personality disorder discharges were being implemented improperly  Over the last six years  Defense Department records indicate that over 22 500 personality disorder discharges have been processed  or on average 10 service members have been discharged per day  every day in that time   Army studies have found that up to 30 percent of soldiers coming home from Iraq have suffered from depression  anxiety or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  A recent study found that those who have served multiple tours are 50 percent more likely to suffer from acute combat stress   The military has discharged more than 22 500 service members with for a  pre existing  personality disorder over the past six years   There are indications that some of these brave warriors may instead be suffering from combat related injuries like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or Traumatic Brain Injuries   Last week  an ABC Nightline investigation reported on Army Specialist Jonathan Town   In 2004  a 107 mm rocket ripped through his unit   s headquarters in Ramadi  exploding two feet about Jonathan   s head and knocking him unconscious   The blast left him with hearing loss  headaches  memory problems  anxiety and insomnia   Instead of treating Jonathan Town for PTSD  the Army discharged him  claiming he had a personality disorder that existed before he entered the military   His discharge not only resulted in the loss of his VA benefits  but the DOD sent him a bill seeking repayment of his  3 000 enlistment bonus   In short  Army Specialist Jonathan Town went off to war to fight for his country     and the government billed him for it   During the course of its investigation  Nightline investigators spoke with 20 veterans who served in Iraq who believe they were misdiagnosed with personality disorders     possibly as a way to avoid paying them disability benefits   This legislation mandates a temporary moratorium on personality disorder discharges until the Department of Defense conducts a proper review and revision of its current policies and procedures related to this diagnosis  It also gives the DOD flexibility by granting an exception to the moratorium in those cases in which a service member provides false or misleading information  or omits information about past criminal behavior during the recruitment or enlistment process  The moratorium would be lifted after the DOD reviews its current policies  ensures it is following standard clinical diagnostic practices  and has established an independent review board to ensure that service members who have received this diagnosis may seek a review   Obama serves as a member of the Veterans  Affairs

  Senator Obama and Rep  Slaughter Introduce Legislation to Protect Children from Lead Poisoning   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senator Obama and Rep  Slaughter Introduce Legislation to Protect Children from Lead Poisoning Wednesday  July 18  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Frank Benenati  Slaughter  or Ben Labolt  Obama  14 Percent of child care facilities contain toxic lead Washington D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and Representative Louise M  Slaughter  D NY 28  today introduced legislation in the Senate and House respectively to protect children from lead poisoning   The Lead Poisoning Reduction Act requires that all non home based child care facilities  including Head Start program locations and kindergarten classrooms  be lead safe within five years  The bill also would establish a five year   42 6 million grant program to help local communities pay to make these facilities safe  and set up  best practices  standards for communities to test for and reduce lead hazards       Lead poisoning continues to pose an enormous threat to our children   s health and safety in day care facilities and schools in Illinois and across America     said Senator Obama     The Lead Poisoning Reduction Act requires all child care facilities to be certified lead safe within five years   The Environmental Protection Agency has endorsed key parts of this proposal with a rule that would require mandatory lead safety training and certification of our schools    contractors  We must act on these basic precautions to keep our children healthy and our schools lead free          Tens of millions of parents entrust the health and welfare of their children to schools and child care facilities every day  and yet millions of boys and girls are exposed to a lead level that will affect them for life     Rep  Slaughter said   This quiet tragedy is entirely avoidable  and we have to do everything in our power to make lead poisoning and its effects a thing of the past    While lead paint in older buildings is a primary source of exposure  lead can also enter tap water through corroded water lines and pipes  Lead in drinking water can account for as many as 60 percent of the exposure for infants and children who consume formula and concentrated juices   Children suffer the greatest negative health impacts  since lead adversely impacts physical and mental development  Specifically  exposure to lead toxins results in decreased intelligence and behavioral problems  and can also lead to kidney damage  anemia  reproductive disorders  seizures  coma  and even death   According to the Centers for Disease Control  about 310 000 children nationwide have toxic lead levels in their blood  with poor and minority children disproportionately at risk  The problem of lead contamination is especially great in the Midwest and Northeast  where 40 percent of child care centers were built prior to 1960  BACKGROUND   The Impact on Illinois and New York  Illinois suffers from the highest lead poisoning rate in the nation  with 20 5 percent of all reported elevated blood levels occurring within the state  Illinois  African American and Hispanic children are at significantly higher risk levels than non minority children   Each year in New York State  10 000 new children under the age of six are identified as having elevated blood lead levels  More than 200 000 children in New York contracted lead poisoning between 1992 and 2004  Children exposed to harmful levels of lead often require special education  medical care  and supervision  often exceeding  4 billion per year in the state alone   A National Epidemic  Nationally  lead poisoning affects 310 000 American children annually  and has been linked to serious health problems ranging from brain damage and hearing loss to comas and death   In 2003  the Department of Housing and Urban Development   s Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control found that 14 percent of licensed child care facilities had significant lead hazards   At facilities where the majority of children attending were African  American  30 percent were determined to pose serious risks of lead poisoning   A lack of enforcement  Nearly 12 million children under age 5 spend 40 hours a week in child care  An estimated 14 percent of licensed child care centers nationwide are contaminated with hazardous levels of lead based paint  according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development   A report by the U S  Government Accountability Office  GAO  identified significant  systemic problems with the way in which the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  monitors and regulates the levels of lead in our nation s drinking water  including a complete lack of reliable data on which to make assessments and decisions  The GAO study found that few schools and child care facilities nationwide have tested their water for lead and no focal point exists at either the national or state level to collect and analyze test results  Few states have comprehensive programs to detect and remediate lead in drinking water at schools and child care facilities                                    ,Obama

      Obama Calls for Increased Cafe Standards  Updated RFS in Energy Bill Monday  November 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 224 5511 WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  calling on them to increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standards and expand Renewable Fuels Standard  RFS  in the comprehensive energy bill currently being negotiated in the House and Senate   The leaders have said they will send an energy bill to President Bush by the end of this year    In October  Obama joined Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  to introduce legislation to immediately update the RFS to require the production of 18 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2016 including 3 billion gallons of advanced biofuels  such as cellulosic ethanol   This legislation recognizes the need for prompt action to update these renewable fuel requirements to provide market certainty to small  local  and farmer owned ethanol producers   Obama has also been a leader in the Senate in pushing for higher CAFE standards  introducing bipartisan bills in both 2006 and 2007  The text of the letter is below  Dear Leader Reid and Speaker Pelosi  I strongly support your joint efforts to send a comprehensive energy bill to the President before the end of the year   As oil prices edge toward  100 a barrel and the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change become more evident every day  your leadership on this issue is needed and greatly appreciated  Both chambers passed energy bills earlier this year that would decrease our nation   s dependence on imported oil and reduce the carbon emissions that contribute to global climate change   Of particular importance are the enactment of a meaningful increase in Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standards and an extension and update of the Renewable Fuels Standard  RFS  which  together  constitute an essential foundation for the achievement of these critical national objectives   Stricter fuel efficiency standards will result in the reduction of carbon emissions   And the promotion of biofuels usage will allow us to meet those standards quicker and with clean burning  renewable  home grown fuel  With regard to CAFE  raising those fuel efficiency standards by 4  annually up to 40 mpg by 2020 could save Americans a total of 549 billion gallons of gasoline  while cutting warming pollution by 6 094 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent gases by 2028   That analysis provides some perspective on the progress that can be made if Congress summons the political will to act boldly  As for the RFS  the Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandated the use of 7 5 billion gallons of renewable fuels in the national gasoline supply by 2012   Two years later  production is now projected to reach 12 billion gallons by the end of 2008   But as ethanol usage passes the congressionally mandated  annual RFS targets  the major oil companies lose any incentive to use more renewable fuels in their supplies or to make higher ethanol blends like E85 available at their service stations   As a result of the renewable fuels industry   s productivity and the petroleum industry   s intransigence  the average national ethanol price on the spot market has plunged 30  in the last six months    The consequences of this development for our dual goals of reducing carbon emissions and displacing fossil fuels are severe   The ethanol industry has been suspending construction starts and facing significant cash flow problems in the face of declining prices   And large multinational corporations have responded by talking publicly about acquiring failing community sized ethanol plants at bargain basement prices  thereby consolidating their position in the industry and increasing their ability to control prices  This clearly hurts farmers and the rural economy   It is also not good for the environment   If current trends continue  the infant cellulosic biomass industry will likely see capital investment falter just when it is needed for the commercialization of developing  higher risk technologies   And finally  the consumer is hurt if we don   t break this policy logjam  as increased availability of domestic ethanol supplies has been proven to reduce gasoline prices at the pump    The Senate passed energy bill anticipated this problem and updated RFS targets to 15 billion gallons by 2015 and 36 billion by 2022   Until those updated levels are enacted  we risk stalling further development of the existing biofuels industry and jeopardizing timely investment in next generation cellulosic fuels from non food sources   I have always felt that higher fuel efficiency standards and the renewable fuels standard together are key to reducing the use of fossil fuels     and especially imported oil     reducing carbon emissions  and building a bridge from the use of corn ethanol to the use of cellulosic biomass ethanol   We jeopardize this potential and risk slowing down economic growth in rural America if Congress does not raise the RFS targets this year  I share your assessment that time is of the essence in moving a meaningful energy bill that includes a CAFE increase and an RFS upgrade through Congress to the President   s desk   And now that the Senate Republicans have united to block passage of the Farm Bill  we should not let a critical investment in our renewable energy future fall victim in the crossfire   I stand ready to do whatever I can to support you in this effort  Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator                                 Pursuant to  policy

ensure market keeps pace with ethanol boom  Builds bridge to next generation of biofuels    WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Harkin  D IA  yesterday introduced a bill to immediately update the Renewable Fuels Standard  RFS  to require the production of 18 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2016 including 3 billion gallons of advanced biofuels  such as cellulosic ethanol   The legislation will implement the RFS requirements that were included in the energy bill passed by the Senate in June   However  negotiations between Senate and House on competing energy bills have stalled  and the new RFS has yet to take effect   Obama and Harkin s bill recognizes the need for prompt action to update these renewable fuel requirements to provide market certainty to small  local  and farmer owned ethanol producers      Despite a boom in production of ethanol by small plants across the country  most consumers around the country have been unable to fill up their cars and trucks with E85 gasoline because of problems in the distribution of ethanol and obstacles to greater ethanol distribution by oil companies   The average spot market price for ethanol has dropped 30 percent over the past six months   With ethanol prices dropping this severely  according to the New York Times   there is likely to be a sweeping consolidation of the industry  and some small companies could go out of business      Without the market stability provided by an increased RFS  many small ethanol plants would face increasing financial danger that could cause them to fail  which would not only jeopardize an important bridge to the next generation of cellulosic fuels  but also hurt farmers  small ethanol producers  and the rural economy as a whole      Those family farmers and local ethanol producers have set an example for how to embrace new technologies to lessen our dependence on foreign oil  and they ve in turn strengthened the rural economy   Senator Obama said    I ve listened to local producers and heard first hand how the dive in ethanol prices is having real  day to day effects on their livelihood  We need to ensure that Washington is giving them a fair shot to compete against the big oil companies that have dominated this industry  kept us dependent on foreign oil  and compromised our environment   We are at a critical time in the history of our renewable fuels industry  and we need to fix the imbalance in the market that s working against locally owned plants   If we are serious about creating clean  renewable sources of energy  we need to support the creation of a domestic biofuels industry that will take us from corn ethanol to cellulosic ethanol    It won t happen if these ethanol plants go out of business because ethanol prices continue to fall and Washington insiders continue to block much needed reforms   I thank Senator Harkin for his longstanding leadership on this issue       We need to increase domestic production of clean  renewable biofuels for national energy security   said Senator Harkin    While the backbone of that industry has been  and continues to be ethanol from corn  we know we need to develop and commercialize biofuels made from cellulosic feedstocks as well   Our farm bill will support that advanced biofuels development   In the meantime  we also need to ensure steadily expanding markets for biofuels  markets that currently are being pinched by limited product distribution channels and consumer access   This new standard is precisely the bridge required to support the steadily expanding use of biofuels to replace more of the gasoline powering the vehicles on our highways      The need for an updated RFS is clear   Currently  ethanol production is booming     but the energy industry is not keeping up   Less than one percent of the nation s 179 000 gas stations  which are franchised from major petroleum companies  offer E 85   Two percent of the nation s 230 million cars are capable of burning E85 ethanol  and American automakers are poised to make half their fleets E85 capable in the next five years     but await the oil industry to allow consumer access to these fuels      A higher RFS was also part of The Biofuels Security Act  legislation introduced on the first day of the new Congress in January  by Senators Obama  Harkin  Lugar  Biden  and Dorgan

  Durbin and Obama Unsatisfied with VA Response   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Durbin and Obama Unsatisfied with VA Response Friday  October 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              CONTACT  Amy Brundage  Obama  or Christina Mulka  Durbin  WASHINGTON  DC     Unsatisfied with the answers that the Department of Veteran   s Affairs  VA  provided in response to two letters  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today called on the Acting Secretary of the VA  Gordon Mansfield  to respond to new information that has come to light regarding patient safety and the quality of care at the Marion VA Medical Center  While asking follow up questions to the response that they received from the VA  the Illinois members expressed their view that any concerns over health care quality at the facility must be immediately addressed  On August 31  the Department of Veterans Affairs suspended all inpatient surgeries at the medical center due to an unusual increase in deaths  Four top hospital officials have been reassigned until an Inspector General investigation is completed  During the investigations  questions have arose about a surgeon  Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez  who was allowed to practice medicine at the facility until August 2007 despite having to surrender his license in Massachusetts after numerous cases of malpractice  The VA   s responses followed two letters that Senators Durbin and Obama sent looking into a spike in deaths at the VA Medical Center in Marion  Illinois  The first letter was sent on September 17 to Secretary Nicholson asking for more information on the ongoing investigation  In the letter  they also sought assurances that the travel and scheduling needs of any veterans who must now be redirected to other facilities to receive their needed surgeries will be facilitated  The second letter was sent to Jim Nicholson  who was serving as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  on September 24 asking specific questions about the VA   s response to the increase in deaths at the center  They also asked why Dr  Veizaga Mendez  who had been barred from practicing in another state  continued to practice at the Marion VA Center until August  The text of the letter appears below  October 18  2007   The Honorable Gordon Mansfield   Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs  U S  Department of Veterans Affairs   810 Vermont Ave   NW   Washington  DC 20420   Dear Secretary Mansfield  Thank you for your response to our offices dated October 12  2007  While we appreciate the timeliness of your reply  the letter raised more questions than it answered  We are therefore writing to request additional answers and clarifications to your responses to our original letters and to ask that you respond to new information that has come to light regarding health care quality and patient safety at the Marion VA Medical Center  VAMC   We respectfully request answers to the following questions  1  How many fatal and non fatal patient safety events have occurred at the Marion VAMC since the beginning of 2006  Specifically  for all surgeries conducted at the Marion VAMC since the beginning of calendar year 2006 through September 2007  please provide figures broken out by quarter and attending physician on the following  a  Actual and expected rates of post operative infection and other  surgical complications  and death   b  Actual and expected average lengths of hospitalization   c  Actual and expected rates of hospital readmission within 30 days  d  Citations from JCAHO and other accreditation and licensing entities  and e  Other relevant indicators of surgical care quality  2  You reported that over the period between April 1 and September 1  2007  there were 36 hospital deaths at the Marion VAMC  To the extent allowable under HIPAA  please elaborate on the reasons for hospitalization  causes of death and how many of these deaths were unexpected  How many of these deaths involved Dr  Veizaga Mendez  3  You provided comparative data that implied that the frequency of deaths between April 1 and September 1  2007  was within normal bounds for the VA  Yet you have previously described there being a    spike    in deaths during this time period  What data or evidence led you to believe there was a spike  4  You reported that  at the time of Dr  Veizaga Mendez    original appointment  VA    made a query of the National Practitioner Data Bank Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank  NPDB HIPDB      Please provide documentation of your query and the information obtained as a result of that query  Was any information returned that would give the VA a reasonable cause for concern in allowing Dr  Veizaga Mendez to care for veterans  5  Please provide any material regarding Dr  Veizaga Mendez you received from the Massachusetts Medical Board during the time he was under consideration for employment at the Marion VAMC as well as any materials or notifications received from the Massachusetts Medical Board while he was employed at the Marion VAMC  Specifically  did the information provided by the Massachusetts Medical Board describe two malpractice payments  one each in 2004 and 2005  made by Dr  Veizaga Mendez and a record of the hospital disciplinary action taken against Dr  Veizaga Mendez in 2004  If not  why was that material not made available to the VA since those actions were already final when Marion VAMC allegedly requested information from the Massachusetts Medical Board  6  As part of their credentialing processes  many hospitals require doctors to answer written questions regarding past charges or claims filed  Did the VA pose such questions to Dr  Veizaga Mendez as part of his VA application  and if so  a  What were the specific questions VA asked of Dr  Veizaga Mendez   b  What were Dr  Veizaga Mendez    answers to these questions   c  Does any of the information he provided conflict with known information about charges or claims related to his practice in Massachusetts  In addition  did the VA contact Dr  Veizaga Mendez   s former employers and former hospitals at which he held clinical privileges in Massachusetts  And if so  did any of the information obtained in those instances provide cause for concern regarding Dr  Veizaga Mendez  Please provide copies of the five written letters of reference that you obtained  7  In describing the VA   s general approach to conducting background checks on medical hires  you reported that the VA Health Administration    also checks the names of all applicants against a Federal list of individuals who have been excluded from participation in any Federal health care programs     Did the VA perform such a check on Dr  Veizaga Mendez and what were the results  What procedures does the VA have in place to ensure that all VA facilities perform such checks when hiring new health care professionals  Our offices have received at least one new complaint involving a veteran who may have sustained a life altering injury in a VA facility as a direct result of a preventable medical error  Our offices are working closely with the family to ensure this individual gets the help and benefits he deserves  This new case  which we are sharing with the Office of the Inspector General  is all the more troubling because it involved a second physician  and not Dr  Veizaga Mendez  This case     and we are concerned there may be others like it     suggests that the problem with health care quality  particularly patient safety  may be more widespread than previously believed  Underscoring this concern is the account from the veteran   s mother that one health professional at the Marion VAMC went so far as to warn her to take her son elsewhere for care  suggesting that concerns over the quality of health care were well known among at least some of the hospital   s staff  This raises the question as to whether this concern was known by the VA   s leadership  Obviously this case must be reviewed and verified  but we expect that you would agree that  given the situation  this case raises serious concerns that must be addressed  8  Does the VA believe that the problems with patient safety and patient care extend beyond the problems associated with Dr  Veizaga Mendez and the other three Marion staff that have been reassigned  Was the leadership of the VA aware of other allegations of poor patient care and lax patient safety  And what steps has the VA taken to ensure that health care quality and patient safety are at the highest levels at all VA facilities nationwide  We want to underscore our belief that the majority of VA health staff perform their jobs with exceptional competence and compassion on a daily basis  They deserve our praise for their dedication and patriotism  and we know that Marion is proud that its VA facility serves veterans across the region  At the same time  Marion residents share our view that any concerns over health care quality at this VA facility must be immediately addressed  We know that you are committed to investigating and remedying quality and patient safety issues  and to preventing similar occurrences at Marion and other VA health facilities around the country  Thank you for responding to our request by October 26  2007  Sincerely    Richard Durbin  United States Senator   Barack Obama  United States Senator                                  ,Obama

         Obama  Durbin Demand Security Improvement At Our Nation   s Airports Friday  October 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              CONTACT  Amy Brundage  Obama  or Christina Mulka  Durbin   In tests  60  of fake explosives went undetected through airport security at O Hare WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Richard Durbin  D IL  today called on TSA Administrator Kip Hawley to immediately improve the bomb detection capabilities at Chicago O   Hare International Airport and our nation   s other airports   According to yesterday   s USA Today  a recent report by the TSA revealed that undercover agents posing as passengers carrying materials for fake bombs were able to walk through airport security undetected at alarming rates during tests last year   Two other airports   Los Angeles International Airport and the San Francisco International Airport   joined O   Hare as the testing grounds for detection of bomb materials at passenger security checkpoints   Of the 75 passengers who carried fake explosives through screening stations at O   Hare  nearly 60  passed undetected   These test results are a frightening reality check for travelers about the screening capability of our nation   s airports    In the letter  Obama and Durbin call on Administrator Hawley to provide information as to what steps have been taken to address these recent security deficiencies  what measures have been taken to improve screener training  and how bomb detection equipment will be improved     Since our country was attacked on 9 11  strengthening security at Chicago O   Hare and other airports has been a top homeland security priority     said Senator Obama      Reports that airport security at our country   s busiest airports failed to detect fake explosives prove that TSA should immediately step up security   It   s time for the Bush Administration to guarantee the safety of travelers and the security of our country        I am disappointed in the results of the TSA report and want to see that the proper steps are being taken to correct the screening deficiencies at O   Hare     said Durbin      Passengers facing long lines at the airport should not have the stress of traveling compounded by a concern for their safety   Senator Obama and I are asking the TSA to explain how they plan to improve screening to ensure the safety for the millions of travelers who use O   Hare     The text of the letter is below  The Honorable Kip Hawley  Administrator  Transportation Security Administration  601 South 12th Street  Arlington  VA 22202 4220 Dear Mr  Hawley    We are writing to request quick action to improve the detection of bomb materials at Chicago O   Hare International Airport and our nation   s other airports   Our letter is prompted by the recently released Transportation Security Administration  TSA  report indicating that undercover agents posing as passengers carrying materials for fake bombs were able to walk through airport security undetected at alarming rates during tests last year  According to yesterday   s USA Today  TSA carried out these tests at three of the nation   s busiest airports  including O   Hare International Airport in Chicago   Two other airports   Los Angeles International Airport and the San Francisco International Airport   joined O   Hare as the testing grounds for detection of bomb materials at passenger security checkpoints   Of the 75 passengers who carried fake explosives through screening stations at O   Hare  nearly 60  passed undetected   These passengers were able to slip past security with false detonators and explosive materials by hiding materials under their clothes and in everyday items such as CD cases  briefcase linings  and toiletry kits   These test results are a frightening reality check for travelers about the screening capability of our nation   s airports  Although some progress has been made since 9 11  the threat posed by terrorism is still real and is still evolving   Materials to make bombs can come in all shapes and sizes  can be hidden with common household items  and can be difficult to detect   It is critical that the TSA respond to these new challenges to stay ahead of the threat   In your October 16 testimony before the Senate Commerce  Transportation  and Science Committee  you stated      A lesson from 9 11 is that we must be proactive   we must anticipate threats that continue to grow in sophistication and complexity     Yet  a Government Accountability Office  GAO  report this month noted that although the TSA has recognized the need for better technology to detect such materials  this technology has not been deployed successfully   In its assessment  GAO rated the TSA   s ability to    deploy checkpoint technologies to address vulnerabilities    as    generally not achieved       We believe that the 60  failure rate at O   Hare demonstrates a failure that goes far beyond    generally not achieved       The Department of Transportation conducted similar covert tests in 2002 and found that screeners missed 60  of simulated bombs at that time   It is unacceptable that this number remains unchanged five years later   While we commend the TSA for continuously running these covert quality tests and for acknowledging the deficiencies in technology to detect explosives  these efforts are futile unless real changes are made    We would like prompt answers to the following questions  1          In last year   s tests  what types of deficiencies were identified that led to the poor testing results   What steps have been taken and will be taken to address those deficiencies   2          Were any deficiencies identified that were particular to O   Hare Airport    What steps have been taken and will be taken to address those deficiencies   3          What steps have been taken and will be taken to better train screeners so that they will more effectively detect bomb materials   4          What steps have been taken and will be taken to improve the performance of detection equipment to assist screeners in finding bomb materials   5          What targets have been established for improved performance in future tests    Thank you for your attention to this matter   We would appreciate a response within two weeks  Sincerely  Barack Obama

examine whether minority homeowners are being targeted with high priced loans WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to FTC Commissioner Deborah Platt Majoras  calling on her to investigate the marketing practices of subprime lenders and the brokers of subprime loans to determine whether minority borrowers have been victims of discrimination   According to recent studies  and an editorial in the New York Times  there is increasing evidence that black and Hispanic borrowers were more likely to be steered to high cost subprime loans than other borrowers   Hundreds of thousands of African American families     many of whom probably should have been eligible for lower cost prime loans instead of riskier subprime loans     could potentially lose their homes in the coming years   In the letter  Obama requests that the FTC investigate whether there is evidence that lenders or brokers target poor or minority borrowers with higher cost products  whether lenders are engaging in deceptive marketing practices  and whether the lack of lower cost borrowing options has disproportionately disadvantaged minority borrowers  The text of the letter is below  October 18  2007    The Honorable Deborah Platt Majoras  Federal Trade Commission  600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W     Washington  D C  20580   Dear Commissioner Majoras  I am writing to bring to your attention the attached editorial from yesterday s New York Times which begins   Evidence is mounting that during the housing boom  black and Hispanic borrowers were far more likely to be steered into high cost subprime loans than other borrowers  even after controlling for factors such as income  loan size and property location     Subprime in Black and White   The New York Times  October 17  2007   In reality  such evidence has been mounting since the 1990s when the Clinton Administration found that subprime loans in 1998 were over four times more prevalent in predominantly black neighborhoods in New York than in predominantly white neighborhoods   More recent studies have found similar examples of potentially discriminatory lending patterns     Last year  for example  the Center for Responsible Lending found that for most types of subprime home loans  minority borrowers are more likely to pay higher rates than white borrowers even after accounting for differences in credit scores  loan to value ratios  and other underwriting criteria   And just this week another analysis confirmed that even high income black borrowers are more likely than comparable white borrowers to have risky and costly subprime loans   Black families are paying more for home loans than similarly situated white families  Effective action to address this disparity is long overdue   I call upon the FTC to investigate the marketing practices of subprime lenders and the brokers of subprime loans to determine if minority borrowers have been the victims of discrimination   Among other things  the Federal Trade Commission is charged with protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive marketing acts or practices   Many subprime loans include sales practices or loan features that are potentially unfair and deceptive for borrowers   Some practices  such as yield spread premiums  which encourage mortgage brokers to steer borrowers into the most costly products  or prepayment penalties  which enable lenders to offer mortgages that are unsupported by sound underwriting principles  appear to be the source of significant problems faced by many subprime borrowers   With an estimated 53  of African American borrowers in 2005 receiving subprime loans  and more than 60  of subprime loans containing prepayment penalties  the risks particularly for African American homeowners are substantial   Indeed  hundreds of thousands of African American families     many of whom probably should have been eligible for lower cost prime loans instead of riskier subprime loans     are expected to face loss of their homes in the coming years   I request that you begin a thorough investigation within five days and provide a status report to my office within 15 days on the following questions  1   Whether there is evidence of lenders or brokers specifically targeting poor or minority borrowers with higher cost products than would otherwise be justified based on legitimate underwriting criteria   2   Whether the marketing of lending products to poor or minority borrowers has been deceptive or unfair   Specifically  whether the disclosure of yield spread premiums and prepayment penalties has been sufficiently transparent to borrowers and whether such or similar sales and pricing practices have been disproportionately detrimental to minority borrowers     3   Whether the lack of lower cost borrowing options  including those regulated by the Federal government  in predominantly minority communities even for higher income borrowers  has disproportionately disadvantaged minority borrowers in their efforts to realize the dream of affordable home ownership and wealth building     Thank you for your assistance protecting all consumers from the pernicious affects of predatory and discriminatory lending practices which undermine the American dream    Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator

sent a letter to President Bush expressing his deep concern about press reports indicating that the White House is planning to cut benefits to men and women who developed cancer and other serious illnesses while helping the United States develop nuclear weapons during the cold war    The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  was enacted in 2000 to provide compensation and medical benefits to employees who worked at certain Department of Energy facilities and nuclear weapons plants  including contractors  subcontractors  and some vendors  Under the EEOICPA  workers who suffer from certain radiation induced cancers and diseases are eligible to receive  150 000 plus coverage of medical expenses    According to press accounts  the White House will be leading an interagency working group to develop ways  to contain growth in the costs of the benefits  of this compensation program  This interagency working group will also discuss whether  administration clearance  should be required before groups of workers are deemed eligible for compensation    In his letter to the President  Obama wrote   If these press reports are true  the White House s plan demonstrates a startling lack of compassion for workers who sacrificed their health to provide for our national security  The Administration should be doing more to help these workers  not trying to make it more difficult for them to receive the benefits that they deserve     Workers at 17 former Illinois nuclear weapons plants qualify under the EEOICPA   However  Obama said that statistics from three of these plants demonstrate the difficulty in obtaining compensation  General Steel Industries plant in Granite City   408 cases have been filed  1 has been paid   Dow Chemical

  Remarks of Senator Barack Obama Ethics Commission Press Conference   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Remarks of Senator Barack Obama Ethics Commission Press Conference Thursday  February 16  2006  Below  please find Senator Obama s remarks from today s press conference about his proposed ethics commission  Joining Obama was Anthony M  Wilhoit  retired chief judge of the Kentucky Court of Appeals and current executive director of the Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission     From the Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission Website     In 1993  the Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission was established by an extraordinary session of the General Assembly which enacted the Code of Legislative Ethics  The Commission is an independent authority within the Legislative Department of state government  It is charged with the enforcement of the Code and is composed of nine citizen members  The Code regulates conduct by legislators  lobbyists and the employers of lobbyists   To learn more  please visit    Remarks of Senator Barack Obama  Ethics Commission Press Conference  Washington  DC  February 16th  2006   I d like to thank Judge Wilhoit for being here today to share with us some of the progress they ve made in Kentucky as a result of the ethics reforms that have taken place in that state      You know  one of the greatest travesties of the scandal that s plagued Washington is not what Congress did  but what it didn t do      Because for all the noise we ve heard from the media about the bribes accepted by Congressman Duke Cunningham  the thousands of dollars in free meals accepted by other congressmen  and the  K Street Project  that filled lobbying firms with former Republican staffers  we ve heard only silence from the very place that should have caught these ethics violations in the first place   the House Ethics Committee    For years now  it s been common knowledge that this committee has largely failed in its responsibility to investigate and bring to light the kind of wrongdoing between Members of Congress and lobbyists that we re now seeing splashed across the front pages   And the sad truth is that neither the House nor the Senate ethics process inspires public confidence that Congress can serve as an effective watchdog over its own Members    All of this means that in the coming weeks  we can pass all the ethics reforms we want   gift bans  travel bans  lobbying restrictions   but none of them will make a difference if there isn t a nonpartisan  independent body that will help us enforce those laws   You don t crack down on crime by hoping criminals will turn themselves in  and you can t clean up corruption by trusting Congress to police itself      That s why I ve recently introduced legislation that would create a Congressional Ethics Enforcement Commission to act as the American public s watchdog over Congress   This proposed Commission would be staffed with former judges and former Members of Congress from both parties  and it would allow any citizen to report a possible ethics violation by lawmakers  staff  or lobbyists      The Commission would have the authority to conduct investigations  issue subpoenas  gather records  call witnesses  and provide its full public report to the Department of Justice or the House and Senate Ethics Committees      This would improve the current process in two ways   First  it would take politics out of the initial fact finding phase of ethics investigations   Second  it would exert greater public pressure on Congress  which would retain the ultimate authority to punish any wrongdoing    The idea of an independent body to conduct initial investigations of ethics violations is not new  as similar commissions have been formed in Florida  Tennessee  and Kentucky  which the Judge will tell us about shortly      On the national level  a similar proposal was also suggested in 1997 by Representative David Dreier  a Republican  and former Representative Lee Hamilton  who I m happy to say has endorsed this current legislation as well   Today  this idea has support from a wide range of organizations and scholars across the political spectrum  from Common Cause to Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute     It s my hope that we can build bipartisan support for this proposal in the weeks to come   In the end  the true test of ethics reform is not whether we pass a set of laws that appeal to a lowest common denominator that we can all agree on  it s whether we pass the strongest bill with the strongest reforms possible that can truly change the way we do business in Washington  That s what the American people will be watching for  and that s what we owe them   Enforcing the laws we pass is a crucial step toward reaching this goal and restoring the public s faith in a government that stands up for their interests and respects their values     THE CONGRESSIONAL ETHICS ENFORCEMENT COMMISSION ACT  Senator Barack Obama has proposing the creation of a Congressional Ethics Enforcement Commission to receive complaints from the public on alleged ethics violations by members of Congress  staff  and lobbyists   The Commission would have authority to investigate complaints and present public findings of fact about possible violations to the House and Senate Ethics Committee and Justice Department   This proposal  which is endorsed by Common Cause and Norm Ornstein  is modeled after similar state commissions in Kentucky  Florida  and Tennessee     Composition  The Commission would be comprised of nine Commissioners chosen by the leaders of Congress   Four of the Commissioners must be former federal judges  and four must be former members of Congress  During their service  Commissioners would be prohibited from serving as a fundraiser for a Senate or House candidate  contributing to a candidate for federal office  serving as an officer in a political party  acting as a registered lobbyist  and participating in the management or conduct of a political campaign   Investigative Powers In conducting its investigations of alleged violations  the Commission would have the authority to issue subpoenas  compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents  and take depositions   All Commission proceedings  including the initial complaint  would remain confidential until a final determination is made   Following a preliminary investigation of a complaint  the Commission would have several options   dismiss the complaint  confidentially inform the alleged violator of potential violations and provide information to ensure future compliance with the law  or upon a majority vote  initiate an adjudicatory proceeding to determine whether to present a case to the House and Senate Ethics Committee or the Department of Justice   The House and Senate Ethics Committee and the Department of Justice would retain the ultimate authority to discipline members of Congress  Frivolous Complaints   To avoid manipulation of the Commission for political purposes  any person filing a complaint that they knew to be false would be subject to a  10 000 fine and up to one year in jail   That person also would be barred from filing any future complaints        No complaints could be filed against a member of Congress in the three months prior to an election to ensure that complaints are not filed for political purposes        What People Have Been Saying about Obama s Legislation We believe that this legislation would do more to reform ethics and lobbying than any other piece of legislation introduced thus far because it goes to the heart of the problem  enforcement      Chellie Pingree  President  Common Cause This approach to ethics enforcement is just the kind of balanced and reasonable alternative we need  Enforcement of ethics in Congress needs independence and credibility to all  but cannot become either a vehicle for the criminalization of policy differences or an avenging angel like the Independent Counsel statute created  This commission would have on it people of integrity and institutional sensitivity  and could serve to educate members and staff about ethical behavior and performance while also providing vigorous and credible enforcement of ethical standards   It deserves strong bipartisan support       Norm Ornstein  American Enterprise Institute Given this deplorable situation  Public Citizen applauds Sen  Barack Obama  D Ill   for having the courage to challenge the business as usual environment on Capitol Hill and introduce far reaching legislation that would establish a Congressional Ethics Enforcement Commission  made up of people outside Congress but appointed by House and Senate leaders  The commission would be a much needed independent and non partisan watchdog charged with monitoring and enforcing compliance to the nation s ethics and lobbying laws       Public Citizen  This bill effectively addresses the fundamental problem of ethics regulation in Congress    the ultimate conflict of interest in which members have total control over every part of the process by which they judge one another   The bill would provide a measure of independent judgment  which is necessary to make the final judgments that Congress reaches more credible  It would also discourage politically motivated ethics charges   None of the other reforms that have been proposed will make much difference unless they are accompanied by this kind of change in the process of enforcement   This bill would strengthen the essential constitutional principle that James Madison emphasized   a body of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time        Dennis F  Thompson  Professor of Government  Harvard University   and author of  Ethics in Congress    This is the first bill that deals seriously with the lack of oversight and enforcement in the existing congressional ethics process   Senator Obama has listened to the concerns of watchdog organizations and has addressed them   This bill will help restore Americans  confidence in the integrity of Congress      Melanie Sloan  Executive Director  Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington  The Congressional Ethics Enforcement Commission Act represents a genuine and constitutional attempt to rejuvenate and further professionalize the legislative self disciplinary process   Its enactment would achieve a proper balance between diminishing the potential for political exploitation of the system and according appropriate safeguards and due process to respondents  all of which would increase public confidence in the congressional self disciplinary power      Stanley M  Brand  Esq   Brand Law Group  Senator Obama s excellent reform is about improving enforcement and transparency which is desperately needed in Washington right now  He proposes to bring an objective  nonpartisan approach to evaluating the link between lobbyists and Members of Congress  something the Ethics Committees have failed to do  Senator Obama has taken the lead in cleaning up Washington with his three reform bills      James A  Thurber  Director and Distinguished Professor  Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies  American University

  Obama  McCaskill Introduce Legislation To Improve Military Hospitals   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  McCaskill Introduce Legislation To Improve Military Hospitals Thursday  March  1  2007  WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senators Barack Obama and Claire McCaskill today introduced the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act  legislation that would cut red tape  improve facilities  and increase oversight at our nation   s military hospitals   Below is Senator Obama   s statement on the introduction of the legislation  Last week  the nation learned of the serious problems at Walter Reed Army Medical Center including decaying  cockroach infested facilities and an overwhelmed patient care bureaucracy   As described in a series of articles in the Washington Post by Dana Priest and Anne Hull  wounded soldiers are returning home from the battle in Iraq only to face a new battle to get the care and benefits they have earned   These stories should not have come as a complete surprise to those who have followed the issue closely   We have long known that troops returning from battle face numerous bureaucratic hurdles when they get home   That   s why I introduced legislation last year to smooth the transition from active duty to civilian life  The Lane Evans Bill expands and improves electronic medical records  face to face physical exams  better tracking of veterans  and other approaches to make life easier for returning veterans   However  the stories out of Walter Reed last week did shock my conscience because  like many Senators  I have made the half hour trek from the Capitol to visit Walter Reed  And I saw what the Army wanted the world to see  a shining world class facility where the wounded can heal with state of the art care   I never saw mold growing on the walls  or broken elevators  or the lack of adequate support for soldiers and their families   Walter Reed was supposed to be the flagship of military health care  Instead it has become an emblem of much that is wrong with the system  and a harbinger of more severe problems that may be hiding at other military hospitals and facilities that are not in the spotlight   The problems at Walter Reed stem from complex causes  the most important of which is that the military and VA have not yet prepared for the growing flood of casualties from the Iraq war    Our injured troops did not hesitate to fight for us on the battlefield     we shouldn   t make them fight again at home in order to receive the care they deserve  That is why Senator McCaskill and I are introducing the bipartisan Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act today  The bill will fix the problems at Walter Reed and improve care at our military hospitals and facilities   Our bill would fix deplorable conditions at outpatient residence facilities by setting high standards and increasing accountability   Under this bipartisan measure  the standards will be clear  First  recovering soldiers    rooms will be as good or better as the best standard rooms for active duty troops  Second  our injured heroes will not have to wait more than two weeks for maintenance problems to be repaired  Third  we will have zero tolerance for pest infestations  And finally  emergency medical personnel and crisis counselors will be available to recovering troops 24 hours a day   The bill also tackles accountability problems  In the days following the Post stories  the Army vice chief of staff  and the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs both said they were surprised by conditions at Walter Reed and directed blame on lower ranking officers and noncommissioned officers   I also read in the Army Times that soldiers at Walter Reed have been warned not to talk to the media  Under our bill  we won   t have to rely on the media to inform the Congress and the American people of the conditions at military hospitals   It requires that the Inspector General inspect facilities twice a year and report conditions to high level officials and the public   Under our bill  military leaders will no longer be able to use the excuse that they didn   t know conditions on the ground   When injured servicemembers return home  they along with their family members face a mountain of paperwork and bureaucracy   From the moment a doctor determines a soldier may be unable to return to duty  it takes an average of 209 days for the military to figure out what to do with the soldier   The system is broken  and soldiers and their families are the ones who pay the price    Our bill addresses this problem by bringing the far flung parts of the military   s Physical Disability Evaluation System  PDES  under one roof in each branch of the military   It also puts much of the system online so that caseworkers and service members can manage their documents electronically   Today  students can apply to go to law school or business school online  without ever having to touch a piece of paper   Navigating the Pentagon bureaucracy should be that easy   Our bill also calls for injury specific procedures so that the most severely injured servicemembers can skip unnecessary steps  There   s no reason why a soldier with a gunshot injury to the spine should face the same procedural hurdles in order to prove his injury was service related as a soldier with less severe injuries   At the same time  nothing in our bill will prevent those service members who wish to stay in the military from appealing decisions   Our bill also helps soldiers and their families navigate the PDES system with new hotlines  manuals  and an ombudsman to help answer questions   Another problem at Walter Reed is casework  The caseworkers are doing amazing work helping soldiers schedule medical appointments  prepare paperwork  and obtain their everyday needs   However  the caseworkers are overwhelmed  Some have to care for 50 or more recovering soldiers at a time  more than double the ideal ratio   The Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act fixes this problem by forcing the Pentagon to work with each military hospital to set the ideal ratio of caseworkers to patients based on the particular needs of that facility   In the interim  our bill requires a temporary ratio of 1 caseworker for every 20 recovering service members  This will push the Pentagon to begin hiring and training caseworkers right away   This legislation also provides important new support for family members who often have to endure economic and emotional hardship to accompany their loved one through the recovery process and the currently flawed PDES process   It clarifies that non medical attendees and family members on invitational orders may receive medical care and mental health counseling while caring for injured loved ones at military facilities   It extends employment and job placement training services to family members   And most important  this bipartisan legislation provides federal protections against a family member on invitational orders being fired   I think we can all agree that a mother should never have to choose between caring for a wounded son or daughter and keeping her job   Secretary Gates promised a thorough investigation by outside experts and accountability for those responsible  Our bill builds on that model by establishing an Oversight Board of outside experts to review the Pentagon   s progress in implementing this bill  The Board would be appointed by Congress and the executive branch and be made up of veterans  wounded soldiers  family members and experts on military medicine   The Oversight Board will be an important check to make sure the Defense Department is following through to care for recovering troops   We cannot move fast enough to make sure our wounded troops are getting the care they need   No cost is too great  We must pass the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act quickly and follow up with the adequate resources to ensure the men and women recovering at military hospitals across the world get the best care we can offer                                    ,Obama

     CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 In 2000  Congress passed a provision requiring the SBA to award 5  of contracts to women owned businesses WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today sent the following letter to the head of the Small Business Administration  SBA   Steven Preston  objecting to the SBA s proposed rule  entitled Women Owned Small Business Federal Contract Assistance procedures  which would do little or nothing to rectify the underrepresentation of and discrimination against women owned businesses in government contracting awards    For decades  evidence has shown that women and minority business owners have been subject to discrimination through lending  access to capital  and basic access to federal contracting opportunities   In 2000  Congress passed legislation to move towards rectifying this problem by aiming to award 5  of federal contracts to women owned businesses   However  this goal has never been met as a result of the SBA s refusal for seven years to take the necessary steps to implement the legislation  and it is unlikely to be met with these unnecessarily stringent proposed regulations  In the letter  Obama calls on the SBA to withdraw its proposal and replace it with a program that reflects the appropriate legal standard  Congressional intent  and the pervasive lack of federal contracting opportunities for women owned small businesses   The text of the letter is below  Dear Administrator Preston   As a member of the United States Senate  I write to convey my strong objection to the SBA s Proposed Rule entitled Women Owned Small Business Federal Contract Assistance procedures  published December 27  2007  Fed  Reg  73285    I join Senate Small Business Committee Chairman John Kerry who expressed his concerns to you in a recent letter as well  The proposal conflicts with the intent of Congress  is unjustified by any legal standard  and will do little or nothing to rectify the underrepresentation of  and discrimination and artificial barriers faced by  women owned businesses in government contracting awards  As decades of evidence has shown  women business owners and minority business owners have been subject to discrimination in numerous ways  including in lending  access to capital  and basic access to federal contracting opportunities   Based on the record  in 2000  Congress passed an unambiguous law that sought to take a small step toward rectifying this chronic problem faced by women owned businesses   The legislation set a realistic and modest goal that 5  of federal contracts be awarded to women owned businesses   Because of persistent barriers  this goal has never been met   In 2006  women owned businesses comprised 30 percent of all small businesses but received only 3 4  of all federal contracts    There is thus a critical need to implement the Women s Procurement Program in ways that will ensure that Congress s purposes will fully be met   The SBA proposal is not only inadequate to meet this goal  in fact it affirmatively undermines Congress s intent that women owned businesses be awarded their fair share of government contracts    First  the SBA proposed regulations impose legal requirements that go far beyond any legal standard  statutory or constitutional   These requirements create a hurdle for federal agencies which will ensure that Congress s permissible and critical goals will never be met    Moreover  the SBA has unnecessarily and unfairly restricted application of the Women s Procurement Program   Congress exceeded constitutional requirements in directing that the Program be used only in the specific industries where women owned businesses are under represented   But in interpreting the study it commissioned  the SBA limited the Program to only 4 of 2 300 business categories  in fact  the study should fairly be read to find under representation in the overwhelming majority of business categories    Despite a clear and legally justified Congressional mandate  the SBA refused to release the necessary implementing regulations for seven years   Unfortunately  this long awaited proposal is a tragic step backward   The SBA should withdraw this proposal and replace it with a program that reflects the appropriate legal standard  Congressional intent  and the pervasive lack of federal contracting opportunities for women owned small businesses     Sincerely    Barack Obama United States Senator                                Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other

                  Obama Joins Levin and Coleman to Introduce Bill to Stop Misuse of U S  Companies Thursday  May  1  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                          Contacts  Tara Andringa  Levin   LeRoy Coleman  Coleman   or Michael Ortiz  Obama   WASHINGTON   Today Senator Carl Levin  D Mich    Senator Norm Coleman  R Minn    and Senator Barack Obama  D Ill    Chairman  Ranking Minority Member  and Member of the U S  Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  introduced the Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act to help law enforcement stop the misuse of U S  corporations  Currently  nearly two million corporations and limited liability companies  LLCs  are formed within the United States each year   The States generally form these corporations without asking for the identity of the corporation s beneficial owners  and numerous law enforcement problems have resulted when some of these corporations have become involved with money laundering  tax evasion  or other misconduct   The bill being introduced would require the States to obtain beneficial ownership information for the corporations formed under their laws and to provide access to this information to law enforcement upon receipt of a subpoena or summons    Criminals are hiding behind U S  corporations while committing all sorts of crimes   from terrorism to money laundering  fraud  and tax evasion   said Levin    Law enforcement has told us for years that they need the names of the true owners behind a corporation to find out who is responsible for the illicit activity  but they can t get it  because the States don t bother to ask   The bill we are introducing today will strike a blow against corporate secrecy  strengthen law enforcement  and curb the misuse of U S  corporations       Criminal activities that exploit the lack of transparency in U S  corporation registrations are more costly than ever   said Coleman   As our work on the Subcommittee has shown again and again  law enforcement has been frustrated by the ability of money launderers and tax cheats to hide behind privately held corporations and LLCs   This bill will shed light on these illegal activities  in a fair and reasonable manner that does not burden the states with an unfunded mandate and protects individual privacy     It is unacceptable for American companies to be used by criminals and terrorists as shields for tax evasion  terror financing  and financial crimes   said Obama    We must ensure our law enforcement agencies have the ability to properly investigate any financial criminal wrongdoing   This important legislation promotes transparency  fairness  and public safety  and sheds light on the people behind corporate entities so that criminal and terrorist activities can be deterred or detected more effectively   The Subcommittee has been pursuing this issue since 2000  when Levin requested the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to conduct an investigation into an individual who set up over 2 000 Delaware shell companies and then established bank accounts for those companies  without revealing their identities  moving  1 4 billion dollars through the bank accounts   In April 2006  the GAO prepared another report in response to a Levin Coleman request entitled   Company Formations  Minimal Ownership Information Is Collected and Available    This GAO report reviewed the legal requirements in all 50 states to set up corporations and LLCs  found that most states failed to request beneficial ownership information  and reported that the absence of this ownership information impeded law enforcement investigations of suspect corporations  In November 2006  the Subcommittee held a hearing in which the GAO report was released  and officials from the Department of Justice  DOJ   the Internal Revenue Service  IRS   and the Treasury Department s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  FinCEN  testified about an increase in the use of U S  shell companies for illicit activities  and the problems caused by the lack of beneficial ownership information   The Subcommittee has collected numerous examples of these law enforcement problems  including the following  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  reported that a Nevada based corporation received more than 3 700 suspicious wire transfers totaling  81 million over 2 years   The case was not prosecuted  however  because ICE was unable to identify the corporation s owners     FinCEN found that  between April 1996 and January 2004  financial institutions filed 397 suspicious activity reports  involving a total of almost  4 billion  U S  shell companies  East European countries  and U S  bank accounts      The Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  reported that U S  shell companies are being used to launder as much as  36 billion from the former Soviet Union   The FBI also reported that they have 103 open cases investigating market manipulation  most of which involve U S  shell companies      The IRS described a scheme involving three individuals who set up U S  shell companies to conceal nearly  9 million in taxable income in secret accounts in the Turks and Caicos Islands and other foreign countries      DOJ reported that Russian officials used shell companies in Pennsylvania and Delaware to unlawfully divert  15 million in international aid intended to upgrade the safety of former Soviet nuclear power plants      On April 22  2008  in response to a written question by Senator Levin  Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff wrote    In countless investigations  where the criminal targets utilize shell corporations  the lack of law enforcement s ability to gain access to true beneficial ownership information slows  confuses or impedes the efforts by investigators to follow criminal proceeds       In July 2006  the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering  which is the leading international organization combating money laundering  issued a report criticizing the United States for failing to comply with a FATF standard requiring beneficial ownership information to be obtained and urging the United States to correct this deficiency by July 2008    In response  the United States has repeatedly urged the States to strengthen their incorporation practices by obtaining beneficial ownership information for the corporations and LLCs formed under their laws   The States  however  have not changed their incorporation practices    U S  corporations are getting a bad name  not only because they are being used to commit crimes  but because U S  law enforcement can t find out who owns them   said Levin    Right now  a person forming a U S  corporation typically provides less information to a State than is needed to obtain a bank account or driver s license   That doesn t make sense  and it invites misuse of U S  corporations   It s time for the United States to meet its international anti money laundering commitments  and that means getting beneficial ownership information for U S  corporations   All 27 countries in the European Union are already required to obtain beneficial ownership information for the corporations they form                                  Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic

  Statement of U S  Senator Barack Obama on the Avian Flu   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Statement of U S  Senator Barack Obama on the Avian Flu Tuesday  October 18  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  October 18  2005  Statement of U S  Senator Barack Obama on the Avian Flu  Remarks as prepared for delivery on the U S  Senate floor  Washington  DC  October 18  2005   Mr  President    We are continuing to witness the relentless spread of avian flu  carried slowly but predictably by wild  migratory birds from countries in Southeast Asia to Western China  to Mongolia  and then over the Ural Mountains into Russia and Ukraine   From there  avian flu has spread over the past week to Romania and Turkey  and we have just learned  possibly into Greece    Dr  Joseph Domenech  chief of the Animal Health Service at the United Nation s Food and Agriculture Organization  has been quoted as saying that     we are not surprised     Mr  President  at this point  no one should be surprised   The experts have told us repeatedly that a flu pandemic is inevitable  although the timing is unpredictable   In other words  the question is not if  but when  This spread of avian flu is our warning signal  and we need to heed this call to action       If we re lucky  we ll have at least a year  or perhaps several years  to prepare for a flu pandemic   But we might not be so lucky   And regardless of whether it is this particular strain of avian flu  H5N1  or another deadly strain  the time to act is long overdue if we want to prevent unprecedented human suffering  death  and economic devastation    International health experts say that two of the three conditions for an avian flu pandemic in Southeast Asia already exist    First  a new strain of the virus has emerged to which humans have little or no immunity   Second  this strain has shown that it can jump between species    The last condition  the ability for the virus to travel efficiently from human to human  has not been met  and it is the only thing preventing a full blown pandemic    Once this virus mutates and can be transmitted from human to human  we will not be able to contain this disease   Because of the wonders of modern travel  a person could board a plane in Bangkok  Athens  or Bucharest and land in Chicago less than a day later  unknowingly carrying the virus   Indeed  we learned this lesson from SARS  which moved quickly from Asia to Canada  where it led to many deaths    As my colleagues know  one of my top priorities since arriving in the Senate has been increasing awareness about the avian flu   In April of this year  I introduced the AVIAN Act  which is a comprehensive bill to increase our preparedness for an avian flu pandemic   This bill was incorporated into a larger bill  the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act  that Senator Reid and I introduced two weeks ago   We need to move this bill as quickly as possible    We also need to provide more funding to purchase vaccines and antivirals and improve our ability to spot and isolate a pandemic as soon as it begins   In the spring and summer  I worked to secure  35 million in funding to fight the avian flu   Today  some of this money is already helping the World Health Organization to step up its international surveillance and response efforts    But clearly much more money is needed   Last month  I joined Senator Harkin and others in offering an amendment to the DOD appropriations bill to provide almost  4 billion to fight the avian flu   I am pleased that Senator Stevens cosponsored the amendment and it was accepted into the appropriations bill   I hope that the House will agree to this funding in conference     Although we have begun to step up to the plate in the Senate  it is unfortunate that none of the avian flu bills that have been introduced have passed into law   Frankly  there s been a lot of talk  but not enough action   And this isn t just true of the Congress    One year after publishing the draft pandemic flu plan  the Administration has still not released the final HHS Pandemic Flu Preparedness Plan   Half of states haven t published plans either  and we know that many of these states will need substantial help    This lack of planning is compounded by the fact that we still don t have a FDA approved vaccine against avian flu  and the one drug that many countries are relying on  Tamiflu  may be less effective than experts had thought     The manufacturer is also struggling to meet the demand  and it could take up to 2 years for it to make enough for the U S  stockpile  presuming this Administration finally puts in an order for the drug    I would ask my colleagues how many hearings and briefings that they have sat through where witnesses and experts have urged the United States government to be better prepared for these types of crises     The failure to prepare for emergencies can have devastating consequences   We learned that lesson the hard way after Hurricane Katrina   This nation must not be caught off guard when faced with the prospect of an avian flu pandemic   The consequences are too high    The flyways for migratory birds are well established   We know that avian flu will likely hit the United States in a matter of time   With the regular flu season coming up shortly  conditions will be favorable for reassortment of the avian flu virus with the annual flu virus   Such reassortment could lead to a mutated virus that could be transmitted efficiently between humans  which is the last condition needed for pandemic flu    The question is will we be ready when that happens   Let s make sure that answer is yes   I urge my colleagues in the Senate and the House to push this Administration to take the action needed to prevent a catastrophe that we have not seen during our lifetimes    Thank you   I yield the floor                                   ,Obama

                     Murray  Kennedy  Obama and Dorgan Demand Answers on Improper Payments to Lenders Thursday  November  1  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE              CONTACT  Alex Glass  Murray   Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy   Amy Brundage  Obama  or  Barry Piatt  Dorgan    Senators question decision not to recoup payments that could have provided more aid for students     Washington  D C       Today  U S  Senators Patty Murray  D WA   Edward Kennedy  D MA   Barack Obama  D IL   and Byron Dorgan  D ND   sent a letter to the Department of Education s Inspector General s Office asking for a complete accounting of the overpayments received by lenders as part of the 9 5 percent Special Allowance Rate program   According to information contained in an Inspector General s report in 2006  and in the Washington Post on October 20th the federal government may have overpaid lenders by hundreds of millions of dollars from 2003 to 2006   Senators Barbara Mikulski  D MD  and Hillary Clinton  D NY  also signed the letter     The 9 5 percent Special Allowance Payment rate began in the 1980   s as a way to increase student access to low cost loans at a time of high interest rates   However  when interest rates fell  the program survived and became beneficial to many lenders since the guaranteed subsidy rate remained at 9 5 percent   At the same time  several lenders received improper payments under this program for loans which were not actually eligible for the 9 5 percent subsidy   This resulted in the overpayment of potentially hundreds of millions of dollars from the Department of Education to these lenders      In the letter  the Senators ask the Inspector General to conduct a careful investigation of the total amount of taxpayer dollars spent on overpayments       We believe that the total amount of improper payments is a knowable number  and that taxpayers deserve to know the total amount of these payments   the Senators wrote   Taxpayers also deserve information on which lenders were involved  what methods they used to claim these subsidies unfairly  and why the Department allowed the inappropriate subsidies to be paid   We request that you conduct a careful investigation of these issues        At a time when millions of students and families are struggling to meet the high cost of college  we owe them a full  fair  and transparent accounting of any possible waste or fraud in the student loan programs    The full text of the letter follows    October 31  2007    The Honorable John P  Higgins  Jr   Inspector General  U S  Department of Education  400 Maryland Avenue  S W   Washington  D C  20202    Dear Inspector General Higgins    We are writing to request that your office undertake an investigation to determine the full amount of improper special allowance payments made by the Department of Education to student loan lenders through the    9 5 percent loan    subsidy    We greatly appreciate your previous investigations on this issue  which  among other findings  revealed that the Department made  278 million in improper 9 5 percent special allowance payments to Nelnet   As you know  however  dozens of lenders have received 9 5 percent special allowance payments during the 27 year history of the subsidy  so it is likely that the sum total of improper payments is much higher   According to an analysis of Department data by the Washington Post  between 2003 and 2006 alone  as much as  300 million may have been improperly paid to other lenders who received 9 5 percent special allowance payments    As early as 2005  Members of Congress had asked the Department to conduct an audit of all lenders that increased the volume of loans claimed as entitled to the 9 5 percent guaranteed rate of return   The Secretary of Education recently stated that her office does not plan to conduct such an audit  and expressed doubt that the total amount of overpayments is even    a knowable number      We believe that the total amount of improper payments is a knowable number  and that taxpayers deserve to know the total amount of these payments  Taxpayers also deserve information on which lenders were involved  what methods they used to claim these subsidies unfairly  and why the Department allowed the inappropriate subsidies to be paid   We request that you conduct a careful investigation of these issues    Since the 9 5 percent loan scandal first emerged  Congress has acted to limit the inappropriate growth of these loans through recycling  and the Department has prohibited lenders from receiving inflated 9 5 percent special allowance payments in the future   These steps will help curtail future abuses  but the public deserves full knowledge of the funds that were misspent in the past   Your thorough investigation of this issue will help us determine the extent to which Congress needs to oversee the Department   s administration of the federal student loan programs more closely  and inform future debate on the Federal Family Education Loan Program      At a time when millions of students and families are struggling to meet the high cost of college  we owe them a full  fair  and transparent accounting of any possible waste or fraud in the student loan programs   We welcome the opportunity to work with you     With respect and appreciation      Sincerely     Patty Murray

Yucca Mountain as a Storage Site for Nuclear Waste WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  yesterday sent the following letter to Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works  EPW  Chairman Barbara Boxer  calling on them to use today s EPW Committee hearing on Yucca Mountain to explore new alternatives for safe  long term solutions for storing spent nuclear fuel     Obama  who has been a consistent opponent of Yucca Mountain as a permanent repository for nuclear waste  urged the Committee and federal government to move past the decades long debate on Yucca Mountain and focus on finding new alternatives to Yucca     In the letter  Obama stated   the selection of Yucca Mountain has failed  the time for debate on this site is over  and it is time to start exploring new alternatives for safe  long term solutions based on sound science     Below is a copy of Obama s letter     October 30  2007   The Honorable Harry Reid  Majority Leader  528 Hart Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510 The Honorable Barbara Boxer  Chairman  Committee on Environment and Public Works   410 Dirksen Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510 Dear Leader Reid and Chairman Boxer  I understand that the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is holding a hearing on October 31 entitled   Examination of the Licensing Process for the Yucca Mountain Repository   at which Senator Reid is scheduled to testify   I know both of you have been working on this issue for many years  so I am writing to share my perspective on the issue given its importance to my home state of Illinois   Although I am no longer a member of the EPW Committee  I respectfully offer the following views and ask that they be included as part of the hearing record    Separately  I will be submitting questions for the hearing witnesses  Given the nation s rising energy demand and the serious problems posed by global climate change  we need to increase the use of carbon free energy sources  such as solar  wind  and geothermal energy   But we cannot deny that nuclear power is     and likely will remain     an important source of electricity for many years to come   How we deal with the dangerous byproduct of nuclear reactors is a critical question that has yet to be resolved     As you may know  Illinois has 11 nuclear reactors     more than any other state in the country   Nuclear power provides more than 50 percent of the electricity needs of Illinois   Where and how we store spent nuclear fuel is an extremely important issue for my constituents   Currently  in the absence of any alternative  spent nuclear fuel generated by Illinois  reactors is stored in Illinois    In 1987  Congress attempted to reach a national solution to the storage of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste by abandoning the scientific consideration of a wide range of possible sites and instead unilaterally imposing a final decision to focus only on Yucca Mountain  Nevada   During the past 20 years  over the strong opposition of the people of Nevada  billions of dollars have been spent by taxpayers and ratepayers in the construction of this location   Millions of dollars have been spent on lawsuits  and hundreds of millions more will be spent in the future if the Department of Energy fails to meet its contractual obligations to nuclear utilities    Proponents suggest Yucca Mountain will not be ready to accept spent fuel shipments for another 10 years  more realistic prognostications suggest we are at least two decades from Yucca Mountain accepting shipments    Legitimate scientific questions have been raised about the safety of storing spent nuclear fuel at this location   With regard to Yucca Mountain  the National Academy of Sciences maintains that peak risks might occur hundreds of thousands of years from now   In 2004  a federal court questioned whether standards developed by the Environmental Protection Agency for the Yucca Mountain repository were sufficient to guarantee the safety of Nevadans   Questions also have been raised about the viability of transporting spent nuclear fuel to Nevada from different locations around the country   Although it would seem to serve the interests of Illinois     and other states with nuclear reactors     to send our waste to another state  transporting nuclear waste materials poses uncertain risk   In fact  since a large amount of this spent fuel would likely travel by rail  this is a serious concern for the people of Chicago  which is the transportation hub of the Midwest    Because of these safety issues and the unwavering opposition from the people of Nevada and their elected officials  there is strong reason to believe that many more billions of dollars could be expended on Yucca Mountain without any significant progress in moving towards a permanent solution to the problem of where to store spent nuclear fuel    For these reasons  I believe that it is no longer a sustainable federal policy for Yucca Mountain to be considered as a permanent repository   Instead of re examining the 20 year licensing process and the billions of dollars that have already been spent  the time has come for the federal government to refocus its resources on finding more viable alternatives for the storage of spent nuclear fuel   Among the possible alternatives that should be considered are finding another state willing to serve as a permanent national repository or creating regional storage repositories  The federal government should also redirect resources toward improving the safety and security of spent fuel at plant sites around the country until a safe  long term solution can be implemented    Regardless of what alternative is pursued  two premises should guide federal decision making   First  any storage option should be supported by sound science   We need to ensure that nuclear waste can be safely stored without polluting aquifers or soil and exposing nearby residents to toxic radiation    Second  we should select a repository location through a process that develops national consensus and respects state sovereignty  not one in which the federal government cuts off debate and forces one state to accept nuclear waste from other states   The flawed process by which Yucca Mountain was selected now manifests itself as a profoundly expensive endeavor of monumental proportion      In short  the selection of Yucca Mountain has failed  the time for debate on this site is over  and it is time to start exploring new alternatives for safe  long term solutions based on sound science   I thank you both for your leadership on this issue  and I appreciate your consideration of my views   Sincerely   Barack Obama  United States Senator                                    ,Obama

 Contact  Amy Brundage  OBAMA  or Shana Marchio  BOND    WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Kit Bond  R MO  and Joseph Lieberman  ID CT  lauded the Senate   s inclusion of an amendment to limit the Pentagon   s use of personality disorder discharges in the FY 2008 Defense Authorization bill   This provision would add additional safeguards to discharge procedures and require a thorough review by the Government Accountability Office  GAO    According to recent reports  there have been some cases in which the Department of Defense  DOD  has inappropriately used these procedures to discharge service members with service connected psychological injuries   Over the last six years  Defense Department records indicate that over 22 500 personality disorder discharges have been processed  or on average 10 service members have been discharged per day  every day in that time   This amendment is cosponsored by Senators Boxer  D CA   Lieberman  ID CT   McCaskill  D MO   Murray  D WA   Sanders  I VT  and Lincoln  D AR      With thousands of American service members suffering day in and day out from the less visible wounds of war  reports that the Pentagon has improperly diagnosed and discharged service members with personality disorders are deeply disturbing     said Senator Obama      It means that those who have served this country aren   t getting the care they need to heal from injuries like PTSD or brain injuries  This provision will add additional safeguards to the Department of Defense   s use of this discharge and mandate a comprehensive review of these policies   This is an important first step and I will continue to fight for additional safeguards as well as the establishment of an independent review board to examine questionable cases in which service members were forced to fight a second war at home   Given our service members    courage and sacrifice for our country  it is our moral obligation to ensure that they receive the care and benefits they deserve        Many of our troops are returning from combat with injuries invisible to the eye but debilitating to them and their families    Unfortunately  many of these injuries have been ignored or worse  dismissed  for too long     said Kit Bond      Abuse of personality disorder discharges is inexcusable   This provision will force the Pentagon to stop using this discharge until we can fix the problem   It is critical that we treat our troops    battle wounds     whether physical or mental        We have no greater obligation than to ensure that our troops receive the care and benefits they deserve for their service to our country     said Senator Lieberman     I applaud the inclusion of this bipartisan amendment in the Senate   s Defense Authorization bill because the Pentagon must take immediate action to ensure that troops are being accurately diagnosed during their service and at discharge for both physical and mental injuries  This amendment will provide DoD with necessary safeguards  and take a closer look at what may be improper discharges of service members with mental health conditions   I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues and the Pentagon on resolving any inequities in the system because our soldiers can afford no less     Recent reports suggest that in some cases the Department of Defense  DOD  has improperly and inconsistently used these procedures to discharge members of the armed forces with service connected injuries such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  and Traumatic Brain Injuries  TBIs   Those discharges can result in the loss of healthcare benefits from the VA as well as the repayment of enlistment bonuses  which can send injured service members and their families into debilitating debt   Army studies have found that up to 30 percent of soldiers coming home from Iraq have suffered from depression  anxiety or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  A recent study found that those who have served multiple tours are 50 percent more likely to suffer from acute combat stress  The military has discharged more than 22 500 service members with for a  pre existing  personality disorder over the past six years  There are indications that some of these brave warriors may instead be suffering from combat related injuries like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or Traumatic Brain Injuries   This amendment mandates temporary safeguards on personality disorder discharges  including a high level review of cases before service members can be discharged  as well as a GAO review of the Department of Defense   s current policies and procedures related to this diagnosis    On June 21  2007  Obama joined Senator Bond  Boxer  Lieberman  McCaskill and twenty four other Democratic and Republican senators who wrote to Secretary Gates to express concern over continuing reports that personality disorder discharges were being implemented improperly

Legislation demands answers on role of contractors in Iraq WASHINGTON  D C      Last night  the United States Senate accepted an amendment to the Defense Department Authorization bill introduced by U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  that will require federal departments to compile and report information to Congress on the role of private security contractors in Iraq         There are too many unanswered questions about the role of private security contractors in Iraq and it   s time for answers     Senator Obama said      The American people have a right to know how their tax dollars are being spent in Iraq and the role that security contractors are playing   This legislation will start getting the information we need to make sure their operations are going forth in a way that doesn   t hinder our military   s efforts to bring this war to a responsible end  I reiterate my calls on President Bush to immediately begin bringing these answers to Congress       Obama originally offered the Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act  S  674  in February   With an estimated 48 000 private security employees operating in Iraq  and more than 1 000 contractors killed since 2003  little is known about what functions these security contractors are performing  how much their services are costing  and what rules of engagement they are following    Specifically  Obama   s amendment will direct federal departments and agencies to report to Congress on the following within 90 days  The total number of contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan The companies awarded these contracts The total cost of the contractors And the process by which federal departments will track the number of contractors killed or wounded Within 180 days  the Department of Defense will have to submit a report to Congress on its strategy for using contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan  a description of the activities being carried out by contractors  and a strategy for ensuring that contractors do not perform inherently governmental functions and that they are not supervising other U S  government personnel   Obama wrote to Secretary Rice today continuing to push for answers on the Blackwater incident and on the role of contractors in general    The text of the letter is below  September 28  2007 The Honorable Condoleezza Rice  Secretary of State  U S  Department of State   2201 C Street  NW   Washington  DC 20520 Dear Madam Secretary   I am writing regarding the September 16 incident in Baghdad involving the State Department s security escort  which consists of armed private contractors from the firm Blackwater USA   According to press accounts of that incident  Blackwater contractors killed at 11 Iraqis and wounded 12 others   This incident and a pattern of similar incidents described in press accounts raise larger questions about the role of private contractors in Iraq     who carry out what had once been viewed as inherently governmental functions   Tens of thousands of private security employees are operating in Iraq  and more than 1 000 contractors have died in Iraq since 2003   As the recent incident in Baghdad illustrates  little is known about what functions these security contractors are performing  how much their services are costing  what military and safety equipment they are provided  and what rules of engagement they are following   For this reason  I introduced the Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act  S  674  in February   This legislation would require federal agencies to report to Congress on   the total number of security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan  the total cost of those contractors  the number of contractors killed or wounded  information about the military and safety equipment provided to contractors  and a description of disciplinary action taken against contractors   The legislation would improve coordination between security contractors and U S  armed forces by requiring the issuance of rules of engagement  clarify the legal status of contractors  and require investigation of criminal misconduct engaged in by contractors   The FY 2008 Defense Authorization bill  which is currently before the Senate  includes several provisions from S  674  and similar provisions have been included in the House version of the bill  In an effort to learn more about Blackwater s operations in Iraq  I am interested in getting your reaction to several issues under the jurisdiction of the Department of State  1   The press has reported several other instances involving Blackwater  including a reported shooting of the Iraqi Vice President s security guard inside the Green Zone on Christmas Eve 2006  reported shootings of Interior Ministry employees  and reported armed standoffs between Blackwater employees and Iraqi police   It has also been claimed by U S  officials quoted in media reports that the State Department was informed of this pattern  but failed to take action against the firm   Has the Department investigated these or other incidents   If so  what were the legal or contractual results of those investigations   2   Following the recent incident in Baghdad  the Iraqi government reportedly banned Blackwater from operating in Iraq   The resulting ban on Blackwater   s operations reportedly caused the entire U S  diplomatic effort within Iraq to cease operations  preventing State Department from even leaving the Green Zone to carry out their jobs for several days   How did the U S  government become so dependent on just one company in order to carry out its mandated missions   What reforms are being implemented to prevent such vulnerabilities for inherently governmental operations in the future   Given the obvious needs  will you be rebuilding the Department s Diplomatic Security office  or will you continue to rely on contractors in a way that could lead to similar problems and vulnerabilities in the future   3   Last year  Congress enacted and the President signed into law a provision stating that contractors operating in contingency operations would potentially fall under the Uniform Code of Military Justice  UCMJ    Is it your view that any illegal actions committed by armed private contractors in Iraq would be punishable under the UCMJ  as Iraq is a contingency operation and they are civilians accompanying the force in the pursuit of that mission   If not  under what legal process would they be held accountable   How many contractors have been held accountable for past incidents over the last four years of operations in Iraq   4   It has also been reported that two former members of the Blackwater firm have pled guilty to the illegal transfer of American made weaponry to the PKK  Kurdistan Workers Party   an organization that is designated as a  foreign terrorist organization  by your own Department   What were the effects of the Turkish government s discovery of U S  weapons in a terrorist group s hands    apparently facilitated by private contractor personnel   Has this incident harmed U S  relations with our NATO ally Turkey and your wider efforts to ensure stability and democracy in the region   5   Lastly  I am concerned about the impact of this incident  as well as others since the private contractor role at Abu Ghraib  on our overall effort to win the wider  war of ideas  that is required to defeat terrorism   This recent incident and other incidents have been widely reported in the Muslim world  with negative implications for U S  efforts   The result is that not only are the private contractors being blamed  but so is the U S  government   Has the State Department conducted an analysis of the consequences of turning over such functions in a contingency operation zone to private contractors   Is this outsourcing actually hurting  rather than helping  our public diplomacy efforts  especially our efforts to win  hearts and minds    The American people have a right to know how their tax dollars are being spent and whether American civilian contractors are following applicable laws   Unfortunately  recent press accounts    particularly those alluding to the State Department s obstruction of a House investigation    suggest that the Department is not interested in a full accounting of Blackwater s actions or in ensuring adequate oversight of Blackwater and other private security contractors   The U S  government must ensure an expedited resolution to these troubling developments  I look forward to your timely responses to my inquiries   Thank you    Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator                                  ,Obama

2005  Remarks as delivered Mr  OBAMA  Mr  President  I rise in strong support of this resolution  Before I make any further remarks  I would like to recognize Doria D  Johnson  and thank her for coming  She is from Evanston  IL  Ms  Johnson is the great  great granddaughter of Anthony Crawford  a South Carolina farmer who was lynched nearly 100 years ago for the crime of being a successful Black farmer  I am sure that this day has special meaning for her  and for the other family members of those who were impacted by these great tragedies of the past  I thank her and others for being here today   Since America s darkest days of Jim Crow  separate but equal  fire hoses  church bombings  cross burnings and lynchings  the people of this great Nation have found the courage  on occasion  to speak up and speak out so that we can right this country s wrongs  and walk together down that long road of transformation that continues to perfect our Union  It is a transformation that brought us the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act  a transformation that led to the first Black Member of Congress  and the first Black and White children holding hands in the same playground and the same school  a transformation without which I would not be standing here speaking today  But I am  And I am proud because  thanks to this resolution  we are taking another step in acknowledging a dark corner of our history  We are taking a step that allows us  after looking at the 4 700 deaths from lynchings  the hate that was behind those deaths  and this Chamber s refusal to try and stop them  to finally say that we were wrong   There is a power in acknowledging error and mistake  It is a power that potentially transforms not only those who were impacted directly by the lynchings  but also those who are the progeny of the perpetrators of these crimes  There is a piercing photographic exhibit in Chicago right now that displays some of the lynchings that occurred across the country over the past two centuries  These photographs show that what is often most powerful is not the gruesome aspects of the lynching itself  nor the terrible rending of the body that took place  No  what is most horrific  what is most disturbing to the soul is the photographs in which you see young little White girls or young little White boys with their parents on an outing  looking at the degradation of another human being  One wonders not only what the lynching did to the family member of those who were lynched  but also what the effect was on the sensibilities of those young people who stood there  watching   Now that we are finally acknowledging this injustice  we have an opportunity to reflect on the cruelties that inhabit all of us  We can now take the time to teach our children to treat people who look different than us with the same respect that we would expect for ourselves  So it is fitting  it is proper  and it is right that we are doing what we are doing today   However  I do hope  as we commemorate this past injustice  that this Chamber also spends some time doing something concrete and tangible to heal the long shadow of slavery and the legacy of racial discrimination  so that 100 years from now we can look back and be proud  and not have to apologize once again  That means completing the unfinished work of the civil rights movement  and closing the gap that still exists in health care  education  and income  There are more ways to perpetrate violence than simply a lynching   There is the violence that we subject young children to when they do not have any opportunity or hope  when they stand on street corners not thinking much of themselves  not thinking that their lives are worth living  That is a form of violence that this Chamber could do something about   As we are spending time apologizing today for these past failures of the Senate to act  we should also spend some time debating the extension of the Voting Rights Act and the best way to extend health care coverage to over 45 million uninsured Americans  We should be considering how we can make certain that college is affordable for young African American children  the great  great grandchildren or the great  great  great grandchildren of those who have been wronged  These are the ways we can finally ensure that the blessings of opportunity reach every single American  and finally claim a victory in the long struggle for civil rights   Today is a step in the right direction  Today s actions give us an opportunity to heal and to move forward  But for those who still harbor anger in their hearts  who still wonder how to move on from such terrible violence  it is worth reflecting for a moment on one remarkable individual  Mamie Till Mobley   Mamie Till Mobley s child Emmett was only 14 years old when they found him in the Mississippi River  beaten and bloodied beyond recognition  After Ms  Mobley saw her child  her baby  unrecognizable  his face so badly beaten it barely looked human  someone suggested that she should have a closed casket at his funeral  She said  No  we are going to have an open casket  and everybody is going to witness what they did to my child   The courage displayed by this mother galvanized the civil rights movement in the North and in the South  And  despite the immensity of the pain she felt  Mamie Till Mobley has repeatedly said  I never wasted a day hating  Imagine that  She never wasted a day hating  not one day   I rise today  thanking God that the United States Congress  the representatives of the American people and our highest ideals  will not waste one more day without issuing the apology that will continue to help us march down the path of transformation that Mamie Till Mobley has been on her whole life  and that the people in attendance in the gallery have been on for generations   I am grateful for this tribute  and I am looking forward to joining hands with my colleagues and the American people to make sure that when our children and grandchildren look back at our actions in this Chamber  we do not have something to apologize for   I yield the floor

  Senators Introduce Legislation to Reduce Gasoline Consumption by Half a Trillion Gallons   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senators Introduce Legislation to Reduce Gasoline Consumption by Half a Trillion Gallons Wednesday  July 19  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Obama Contact  Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511 Date  July 19  2006  Bipartisan Coalition of Senators Introduce Legislation to Reduce Gasoline Consumption by Half a Trillion Gallons  13 1 Million Barrels of Oil  by 2028 Legislation Would Increase Fuel Economy Standards for First Time in 20 Years   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Richard G  Lugar  R IN   Joseph Biden  D DE   Gordon Smith  R OR   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Tom Harkin  D IA   Norm Coleman  R MN  and Dick Durbin  D IL  today introduced legislation that would reduce U S  gasoline consumption by nearly half a trillion gallons by 2028 and greatly decrease our dependence on foreign oil    The true danger of America s dependence on foreign oil is best explained not by politicians or energy experts here in the United States  but by our enemies abroad   said Obama     Oil  is the umbilical cord and lifeline of the crusader community   These are the words of Al Qaeda   Focus your operations on oil  especially in Iraq and the Gulf area  since this will cause them to die off  on their own    These are the words of Osama bin Laden  It is clear that the Achilles heel of the most powerful country on earth is the oil we import and cannot live without      Most of the world s oil is concentrated in places that are either hostile to American interests or vulnerable to political upheaval and terrorism   said Lugar  Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee   To the extent that we remain reliant on imported oil  we imperil our nation s economic health and our way of life      If it was not clear before  it is now  Domestic energy policy is at the center of our foreign policy   said Senator Joseph R  Biden   For our national security we have to begin the transition to alternative fuels  We can t do that without making progress on fuel economy by upgrading to a better system that combines protection for U S  automobile manufacturing jobs with predictable increases in fuel efficiency standards for cars  SUVs and light trucks       Gas prices are skyrocketing but they re just the part of our problem   said Senator Gordon H  Smith  R OR    Importing so much oil leaves us vulnerable to some of the most unstable regimes in the world  Automakers have been too slow to change and we re risking damage to American security and the economy       The U S  passenger fleet alone accounts for 1 10th of world oil consumption   said Bingaman   With oil and gasoline prices where they are today  it s hard to imagine a genuine discussion of our country s energy future without a significant effort to improve vehicle fuel efficiency  This moderate proposal to begin raising the standards for fuel economy deserves a serious look from the Senate  There are many good ideas out there and a healthy debate to be had about the best ways to do this  I hope the introduction of this bipartisan bill can spur the Senate to have this long overdue discussion      This sound approach to reducing gasoline consumption will help ensure our vehicles utilize improved technology to stretch how far Americans can drive on a tank of gas   said Harkin   Our dependence on foreign oil not only hurts the budgets of American families  it threatens our economy and national security      Our reliance on foreign oil is not only an economic strain  but also a threat to our national security   said Coleman   It s time we take the decisions about our energy supply out of the hands of foreign nations  By coupling a sensible fuel efficiency standard that will push technology to the marketplace with strong tax incentives  we can put American in the fast lane to energy independence     For years now  automobile manufacturers have built bigger and less efficient vehicles  leaving consumers with poor choices in terms of fuel economy  Automakers have the technology to make SUVs and other vehicles get better gas mileage  but they have chosen not to do that    instead the largest SUVs have gotten bigger  heavier and more dangerous   said Durbin   It s time we fix the law and encourage both manufacturers and consumers to make smart choices for the future     America spends  800 million a day  or  300 billion annually  on its 20 million barrel a day oil habit  Passenger vehicles alone burn 8 million gallons of oil each day  Because we import 60 percent of our oil  much of it from the Middle East  our dependence on oil is also a national security issue  With oil prices hovering near  75 a barrel and total U S  petroleum use estimated to increase 23 percent over the next 20 years  we must act now to prevent a future energy crisis  But while it s clear that increasing fuel economy standards is a crucial part of any effort to reduce our consumption of foreign oil  efforts to raise them have been stalled for 20 years   The Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2006 seeks to break the decades long logjam on increasing fuel economy standards by taking a new  more flexible approach  The bill charges the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration  NHTSA  to create regular annual increases in fuel economy with a target of 1 mile per gallon each year  The experts at NHTSA will base these standards on attributes of a vehicle such as size and weight  and will be able to revise the annual increase if they conclude that the target cannot be reached with current technology or without compromising the safety of the entire fleet  or is not cost effective when compared to the economic and geopolitical value of a gallon of gasoline saved    This legislation flips the current debate about increasing fuel economy standards on its head  from a debate about whether standards will be raised to presumption that they will be raised    In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop more fuel efficient vehicles  the legislation also provides generous tax incentives for companies to retool parts and assembly plants  This would strengthen the U S  auto industry by allowing them to compete with foreign hybrid  E 85 and other fuel efficient vehicles  The bill would also allow more Americans to benefit from a tax credit for the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles by lifting the current cap that only makes eligible the first 60 000 buyers per manufacturer each year    If this 4 percent per year improvement is maintained for 20 years  this bill would reduce gasoline consumption by 549 billion gallons  If gasoline were just  2 50 per gallon  that means consumers would save  1 372 trillion at the pump by 2028    The Fuel Economy Reform Act would also provide fairness and flexibility to domestic automakers by establishing different standards for different types of cars  Currently  manufacturers have to meet broad standards over their whole fleet of cars  This disadvantages companies like Ford and General Motors that produce full lines of small and large cars and trucks rather than manufacturers that only sell small cars    We need to act now if we want to prevent an even greater energy crisis in the future   said Obama   This bipartisan  common sense approach will finally harness the technology we already have to save Americans money at the pump and save America from a dependence on the world s most unstable  undemocratic regimes     The Fuel Economy Reform Act A New Approach to Increasing CAFE Standards   On Wednesday  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Richard G  Lugar  R IN   Joseph Biden  D DE   Gordon Smith  R OR   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Tom Harkin  D IA   Norm Coleman  R MN   and Dick Durbin  D IL  introduced the Fuel Economy Reform Act to break the legislative and administrative logjam that has prevented fuel economy standards from being raised for more than 20 years   A New Approach  The Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2006 seeks to break the logjam on establishing greater vehicle fuel economy by establishing a target  rather than a mandate  of a 4 percent annualized increase in Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standards   a rate that the National Academy of Sciences has determined is possible   unless the experts at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  justify a deviation in that rate by proving that the increase is technologically unachievable  cannot maintain overall fleet safety  or is not cost effective when comparing with the economic and geopolitical value of a gallon of gasoline saved   Higher Fuel Economy Standards  If the 4 percent per year target is met for ten years after the continuous provision improvements go into effect  this bill will save 1 3 million barrels of oil per day and 20 billion gallons of gasoline per year   If gasoline is just  2 50 per gallon  consumers will save  50 billion at the pump in 2018 alone  By 2028  Americans will have saved a total of 549 billion gallons of gasoline and cut global warming pollution by 6 094 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent gases   Flexibility for Manufacturers  The Fuel Economy Reform Act also provides fairness and flexibility to domestic auto makers by establishing different standards for different types of cars   Currently manufacturers have to meet broad standards over their whole fleet of cars   This disadvantages companies like Ford and General Motors that produce full lines of small and large vehicles rather than manufacturers that only sell small cars   The bill creates further flexibility by giving NHTSA the authority to allow companies to earn credit for improving fuel efficiency beyond the CAFE standard in one type of car  and using those credits to meet goals for other vehicle models   Companies would be able to trade or sell excess credits  improving overall fuel standards in the most efficient way  Because technological advances may affect manufacturers over time  the bill instructs the Energy Department  Environmental Protection Agency  and National Academy of Sciences  to study ways to reform the regulatory structure of this approach in 2016   Incentives for Fuel Efficiency  In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop advanced technology vehicles  this legislation provides generous tax incentives for companies to retool parts and assembly plants   This will strengthen the U S  auto industry by allowing them to compete with foreign hybrid  E 85 and other fuel efficient vehicles   The bill would lift the current 60 000 per manufacturer cap on buyer tax credits to allow more Americans to buy ultra efficient vehicles    The Problem    America is Addicted to Foreign Oil  America s 20 million barrel a day habit costs our economy  800 million a day  or  300 billion annually   We use 8 million barrels of oil each day on passenger vehicles   Because we import 60 percent of our oil  much of it from the Middle East  our dependence on oil is also a national security issue   While oil currently hovers near  75 a barrel and  3 00 a gallon at the pump  over the next 20 years total US petroleum demand will increase 23 percent     CAFE Initial Success Followed by 20 Years of Little Progress  In response to the OPEC oil embargo in the 1970s  Congress enacted CAFE standards  the first ever requirements for gas mileage  Under Congress  direction  the NHTSA raised the average gas mileage of cars and trucks from just over 14 miles per gallon  mpg  in 1976 to 27 5 mpg for cars and 20 7 mpg for trucks by 1985   By enacting these standards  the country saves approximately 3 million barrels of oil per day  making it the most successful energy saving measure ever adopted   Unfortunately  since 1985 the NHTSA has been largely unable to increase standards   The CAFE standard for cars has remained frozen at 27 5 mpg for 20 years   The standard for trucks only increased by 2 mpg to 22 2 mpg for 2007   Over those 20 years  the auto industry has developed numerous innovations  which allowed fuel efficiency standards to rise to 45 miles per gallon in Japan   Congressional Deadlock  Since 1985  Congress has considered numerous bills to increase fuel efficiency  without significant gains in CAFE standards   Recently  there has been a logjam between those who want Congress to mandate specific increases in CAFE standards  and those who want to cede the policy choice to NHTSA  even though the agency has been unable to inability to overcome institutional and political obstacles to increasing CAFE standards                                     ,Obama

                                Statement of Senator Barack Obama on HELP Committee Hearing on the WARN Act s 20th Anniversary Tuesday  May 20  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today submitted the following testimony to the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee hearing on Plant Closings  Workers  Rights and the WARN Act s 20th Anniversary   I started my career on the south side of Chicago trying to help people in communities devastated by steel plant closings get back on their feet   One of the things I learned early on  and have seen over and over again  is that American workers who have committed themselves to their employers expect in return to be treated with a modicum of respect and fairness   Failing to give workers fair warning of an upcoming plant closing ignores their need to prepare for the transition and deprives their community of the opportunity to help prevent the closing   I know that you have heard the frustration of workers who are let go by email the day before a plant closes or are told when they come to work that their services are no longer necessary   Many of these workers support families that are living from pay check to pay check  squeezed by the demands of rising health care costs  the declining value of their homes  and wages that have been stagnant for decades   It adds insult to injury to close a plant without warning employees   There may be no stronger advocate for these workers than Senator Brown  and I thank you for holding this hearing and authoring legislation to strengthen the Worker Adjustment and Retraining and Notification Act  WARN    I fully support your efforts and look forward to helping you move the legislation through the process   We must give the WARN Act teeth to ensure that workers are not chewed up and spit out without a job or a paycheck    When I was a member of the Illinois Senate  I worked to strengthen enforcement of the existing WARN Act by requiring the Illinois Department of Employment Security to annually notify employers of their responsibilities under the WARN Act   But we must act at the federal level to close the loophole that allows employers to disregard the WARN Act without penalty     Congress passed the WARN Act in 1988 to give workers and communities two months  advance notice to adjust to an impending plant closing or layoff   And where employers have complied with the law  retraining and other readjustment efforts have a much greater chance to succeed than when such programs are rushed into place because there was no advance notice of a plant closing   But despite the WARN Act  employers have all too often failed to provide workers with that vital notice   The GAO has found recently that 24 percent of all layoffs are subject to WARN requirements  yet employers provided notice in approximately one third of these situations  And courts have increasingly dismissed lawsuits brought by workers who have been unfairly denied notice     Senator Brown s FOREWARN Act would modernize and enhance the WARN Act s protections   I am proud to be a co sponsor of this important legislation   It would reduce the mass layoff figure from 50 to 25 employees  and reduce the threshold for coverage of firms from 100 to 50 employees   The FOREWARN Act would also lengthen the notification period from 60 to 90 days  require employers to provide written notification to the Labor Secretary  and increase penalties for violations of the WARN Act from back pay to double back pay   Finally  the bill authorizes the Labor Department to enforce the law  and permits state attorneys general to pursue claims if the Labor Secretary fails to act within six months   These are long overdue improvements in the law   Workers and their communities have a right to know when they are facing a serious risk of a plant closing   Making that information available before the plant closes can  in the best case scenario  help communities come together to prevent the loss and  in the worst case scenario  help workers and communities prepare for the difficult transition to come   Basic fairness and respect for working men and women require that we pass the FOREWARN Act                                  Pursuant to

WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  made the following statement on the floor of the Senate to urge his colleagues to support an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill to require minimum periods between deployment for members of the Armed Forces serving in Iraq and Afghanistan  The legislation is sponsored by Senator Jim Webb  D VA   Obama is a cosponsor  Below are Senator Obama   s remarks as prepared for delivery        Mr  President  I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by Senator Webb to require minimum periods between deployments for members of our Armed Forces who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan   This amendment protects our brave men and women in uniform and ensures that our Armed Forces retain their ability to meet any challenge around the world   I   m proud to be a cosponsor       I opposed the war in Iraq from the beginning and have called repeatedly for a responsible end to the foreign policy disaster that this Administration has created   Over 3 700 American servicemen and women have died in this war  and over 27 000 have been seriously wounded   Each month  this misguided war costs us a staggering  10 billion  and when all is said and done  it will have cost us  1 trillion        There are different views of the war in this chamber  but there is no disagreement about the tremendous sacrifice of the men and women who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan   They have performed valiantly under exceedingly difficult circumstances   They have done everything that we have asked of them       But they have also been stretched to the limit   The truth is we are not keeping our sacred trust with our men and women in uniform     we are asking too much of them  and we are asking too much of their families   We owe it to our troops and their families to adopt a fair policy that ensures predictable rotations  adequate time to be with their families before redeployment  and adequate time for realistic training for the difficult assignments we are giving them        Our servicemen and women will always answer the call of duty  but the reality is that extended deployments and insufficient rest periods are taking their toll   The effects of this strain are clear   increasing attrition rates  falling retention rates among West Point graduates  increasing rates of PTSD  and unprecedented strain on military families      This amendment is a responsible way to keep our sacred trust while restoring our military to an appropriate state of readiness   It ensures that members of our Armed Forces who are deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan have at least the same amount of time at home before they are redeployed   It would also ensure that members of a reserve component  including the National Guard  cannot be redeployed to Iraq or Afghanistan within three years of their previous deployment         After four and a half years of fighting in Iraq and almost six years of fighting in Afghanistan  we owe it to our troops and their families to provide them with a more predictable schedule with sufficient time at home between deployments   As the Military Officers Association of America  which represents 368 000 members  has stated      If we are not better stewards of our troops and their families in the future than we have been in the recent past  MOAA believes strongly that we will be putting the all volunteer force at unacceptable risk          There are scores of anecdotes that bear out the strain on our families   One woman from Illinois recently wrote my office to tell me how her husband was facing his fourth deployment in four and a half years   She described how her husband had spent so much time in Iraq that  in her words      He feels like he is stationed in Iraq and only deploys home      That is not an acceptable way to treat our troops   That is not an acceptable way to treat their families        This amendment is not only important for military families  it   s also important for our national security        Our military simply cannot sustain its current deployments without crippling our ability to respond to contingencies around the world        This is all the more important since the Administration has squandered our resources on the war in Iraq and neglected to address other serious threats to our safety   According to a National Intelligence Estimate in July  al Qaeda has    protected or regenerated key elements of its Homeland attack capability     including a safe haven in Pakistan   s tribal areas  operational lieutenants  and its top leadership   Ensuring the readiness and capabilities of our troops will be crucial to confronting the threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and other parts of the world  and deterring other threats to America   s national security        Over the coming months  I will continue to push for a new course in Iraq that immediately begins a safe and orderly withdrawal of our combat troops  that changes our military mission to focus on training and counter terrorism  that puts real pressure on the Iraqis to resolve their grievances  and that focuses our military efforts on the real threats facing our country   This amendment is an important part of that new course        I urge my colleagues to support this proposal                                        ,Obama

                                                            Obama  Senators Urge Special Review Board for Discharged Military Personnel  Moratorium on Personality Disorder Discharges Friday  December 21  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact Shana Marchio  Bond   Michael Ortiz  Obama  Nathan Britton Boxer   or Adrianne Marsh  McCaskill   Bond  Boxer  Obama  McCaskill Demand Fair Treatment of Combat Vets WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Kit Bond  R MO   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Barack Obama  D IL   and Claire McCaskill  D MO  are urging President Bush to create a Special Review Board for discharged troops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and to place a moratorium on the military   s use of Personality Disorder Discharges     With thousands of American service members suffering every day from the less visible wounds of war  reports that the Pentagon has improperly diagnosed and discharged service members with personality disorders are deeply disturbing     said Senator Obama      These heroes make incredible sacrifices for our country  and our brave men and women shouldn t have to fight a second war at home to get the benefits and care they deserve  The President should halt this practice until the military can review its policies and establish a special review board to examine the cases in question        Our government has a lifelong responsibility to care for the brave volunteers who have served our nation honorably in combat  unfortunately  the government is failing some of our wounded warriors     said Bond      It is critical that the government starts treating all of our troops    battle wounds     physical and mental  visible and invisible        It belittles the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform when you punish   instead of treat   those with combat injuries     said Boxer     When our brave service members are injured in combat  we cannot deny them benefits  blame their conditions on a pre existing disorder  or refuse them the care and support they deserve        The horrors of war are bad enough without a service member coming home only to have to fight against the government they fought to protect     McCaskill said     I   m please to be fighting side by side with Senator Bond in requesting a review board to study personality disorder discharges  so that those men and women who bravely fought for us and returned home with the mental scars from war get a fighting chance to receive the benefits they so greatly deserve     This bipartisan group of Senators has been examining mental health care for service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and leading the effort to end the military   s inappropriate use of personality disorder discharges  Much like the program created by President Carter to examine the records of Vietnam veterans discharged less than honorably  the Senators are urging the President to create a Special Discharge Review Program to look at administrative discharges for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  If established  the Board would give service members who served honorably in combat but subsequently received a discharge that does not entitle them to benefits the opportunity to have their cases reviewed   This is particularly important for those who failed to receive an appropriate diagnosis of or treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  or Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI   The Senators believe such a process will help reduce the stigma associated with such discharges and allow those who served our nation honorably to resume normal lives after their service      The discharge review board will also look at cases where service members were diagnosed for personality disorders  In the past six years  more than 22 500 service men and women have been discharged with a    pre existing    personality disorder   The Senators have expressed concern that some of these discharges appear to be the result of misdiagnoses and are being used to force out troops who may instead be suffering from service connected psychological injuries     like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or Traumatic Brain Injury  The use of a personality discharge can result in a loss of disability benefits and medical care from the VA  and can even lead to service members having to repay thousands of dollars in re enlistment bonuses  The Senators continue to urge for the adoption of short term  commonsense safeguards to protect service members  The Senators emphasize that just limiting the use of this discharge is not enough  A moratorium  which would temporarily suspend the Pentagon   s use of personality disorder discharges for those service members who have served in combat  is necessary until there is a comprehensive review of the current procedures and additional safeguard to prevent misdiagnosis                    Bond  Boxer  Obama and McCaskill were joined by a bipartisan group of their Senate colleagues including  Joseph Biden  D

Obama to Propose Aid for Katrina Children   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  Thursday introduced legislation to help low income children from Hurricane Katrina affected areas by temporarily extending the Child Tax Credit to low income parents in counties affected by the storm    The legislation was introduced as an amendment to a  70 billion tax cut bill    This achieves two goals  First  it helps keep a promise the President made to rebuild the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina   Obama said   Second  in a  70 billion bill laden with tax cuts for the wealthy and well connected  it sets aside less than 1 percent for our neediest children     On September 15  2005  President Bush stood in the ruins of New Orleans and vowed to  do what it takes  to help the region recover  He also acknowledged the terrifying images of abject poverty that struck Americans on their TV screens and said   We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action    Five months later  the President has not followed through with bold actions  while the neediest families struggled to put their lives back together    This uses a cost effective and proven tool in our tax code  the Child Tax Credit  to extend aid to low income working families affected by Hurricane Katrina   Obama said     Since it was established in 1997  the Child Tax Credit has helped millions of parents with tax credits of up to  1 000 a year per child  However  the benefit is currently skewed so that many families who need it the most cannot get it  Because the credit does not begin to go into effect until a parent makes at least  11 000 a year  someone who works full time at minimum wage is ineligible to receive any of the credit  Millions more low income families can only receive a partial credit   Across the country  17 million chilX Eon Dm  dm31 Return Path  in Louisiana  Mississippi and Alabama did not receive the full credit    Senator Obama s amendment would temporarily extend the Child Tax Credit for parents in counties declared disaster areas in the storm   It would allow these parents to begin receiving the credit with the first dollar of earned income  instead of the current  11 000 floor   A parent who earns  10 000 a year  the equivalent of full time employment at minimum wage  would receive the entire  1 000 credit    We should send a simple message  if you work  your kids get a benefit   Obama said   That s a common sense way to support families with children  especially families that have experienced the devastation of a natural disaster      The amendment is narrowly tailored and fiscally responsible   It is aimed at families affected by the Hurricanes  and it provides short term support  expiring in 2008   Costs are offset by not extending the tax breaks on the investment income of people who earn more than  100 million a year    Floor Statement of Senator Barack Obama  Hurricane Katrina Child Assistance Amendment  Senate Floor  February 1  2006   Mr  President  I rise to speak about an amendment to the Tax Reconciliation bill that I intend to offer at the appropriate time     The Amendment achieves two goals   First  it helps keep a promise the President made to rebuild the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina   Second  in a  70 billion bill laden with tax cuts for the wealthy and well connected  it sets aside less than 1 percent for the neediest in our society    Two weeks after Katrina made landfall  President Bush stood in the ruins of New Orleans and vowed to  do what it takes  to help the region recover  He also acknowledged the terrifying images of abject poverty that struck Americans on their TV screens and said   We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action    Five months later  the President s timid actions have not matched his bold rhetoric   He has not lived up to his promises    My amendment uses a cost effective and proven tool in our tax code  the Child Tax Credit  to extend aid to low income working families affected by Hurricane Katrina     Enacted in 1997  the Child Credit allows families with qualifying children to receive a credit of  1 000 per child against their federal income tax   Unfortunately  the credit is skewed so that many families who need it the most can t get it     Under current law  families that earn less than  11 000 get no benefit from the refundable child credit   That means that a child is left out of the credit even if her parent works full time at minimum wage  which has not increased since 1997   And the child doesn t get the full benefit of the  1000 credit until her parent earns close to  18 000  or even more if the child has siblings       What s worse  if her parents  incomes stagnate  are disrupted for any reason  or the economy stalls and work hours or wages are reduced  the value of the credit drops or even disappears   Under current law  almost 17 million children get less than the full credit     We all know what happened to the families on the Gulf Coast due to Hurricane Katrina  and it will be a long time before these families can rebuild their lives    Many of the families in the affected states were evacuated to other areas  and many of them cannot even afford to go back   And the federal response so far has been inadequate to get these families effectively back on their feet     We need to do better  At a time when we are debating  70 billion of tax breaks  many of which will benefit those who need the least help  it is critical that we remember the worst off and the most vulnerable members of our society    When I went to Houston after the Hurricane  I met an evacuee from New Orleans who said to me   we had nothing before the hurricane  and now we ve got less than nothing    Life was hard for many families even before Katrina hit   In Louisiana  Mississippi  and Alabama  for example  more than 900 000 children under 17 years old were so poor that they got no child tax credit or only a partial credit   These states had among the highest rates of children too poor to get the full credit   In fact  more than 1 3 of the children in Mississippi and Louisiana didn t get the full benefit of the child tax credit     This amendment  at a cost of less than 1 percent of the overall Tax Reconciliation bill  will provide necessary assistance to many of these families   The amendment eliminates the income threshold that excluded all children in families with less than  11 000 of income     My amendment sends a simple message  if you work  your kids get a benefit   It provides a partial credit starting with the first dollar of a parent s income for families who lived in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina       The amendment is simple   it says that the children of low income working parents affected by Hurricane Katrina will no longer be denied the child credit   You work  your kids get a benefit   If you don t work  no benefit   And if you want the full benefit  you have to earn at least  10 000  which is just about the income of a full time job at minimum wage     That s a common sense way to support families with children  especially families that have experienced the huge cost   psychological and financial   of a natural disaster     My amendment is also narrowly tailored and fiscally responsible   It is aimed at families affected by the Hurricanes  and it provides short term support  expiring in 2008    With this amendment  hundreds of thousands of this country s most disadvantaged children will see an increase in their credit   Katrina offered us a window into America s poverty   Let s not let that window close without doing something to provide a chance for America s children to rebuild their lives with dignity  hope  and

                      CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  Obama   Christina Mulka  Durbin   or Phil Bloomer  Johnson  More than 1000 homes were damaged during devastating flooding in Iroquois and Livingston Counties WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Dick Durbin  D IL   and Representative Tim V  Johnson  R IL  today sent the following letter  requesting that President Bush declare Iroquois and Livingston Counties federal disaster areas so they would be eligible for federal relief after experiencing devastating flooding in January   In the past week the Illinois Emergency Management Agency has reported more than 1000 homes have been impacted  with 237 homes classified as sustaining major damage   With such significant damage  state and local governments do not have the resources required for recovery   Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich has already declared a state disaster for these counties    The Illinois families and businesses affected by January s flooding deserve federal relief to rebuild as quickly as possible   said Senator Obama    I call on the President to immediately provide grants and loans so these communities can recover   I will continue working with Senator Durbin and the Illinois delegation to ensure that Illinois  communities have the resources they need to best respond to natural disasters    Even with the power is back on  and the storm long gone  residents and business owners are still facing a mountain of challenges   said Senator Durbin    A Presidential disaster declaration will start the process of matching these needs with money   I will continue to work with Senator Obama  Representative Johnson and the Illinois delegation in urging the President to provide federal assistance to Iroquois and Livingston counties    The numbers speak for themselves   added Rep  Johnson   Six weeks after the flood  people remain homeless  their homes uninhabitable and beyond their ability to repair  Phone service has not been completely restored  Students have not returned to school  Businesses have not reopened  Local officials and first responders have been stretched to the limits of endurance  not to mention patience with the federal government they have looked to for help  The need is beyond compelling  it is imperative   The text of the letter is below  Dear Mr  President  We write in support of the appeal dated February 21  2008  from Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich asking that two counties in the state be declared federal disaster areas based on recent severe flooding that affected the area   Governor Rod Blagojevich has already declared a state disaster for these counties   The areas that experienced this flooding were Iroquois and Livingston counties located in Central and East Central Illinois   In the past week  the Illinois Emergency Management Agency has been on the ground reassessing the damage that was caused by the floods  They are reporting more than 1000 homes have been impacted with 237 homes classified as sustaining major damage   These updated reports significantly increase the numbers in the initial assessment   Furthermore  multiple businesses have been affected by these floods and some are still closed a month after the flooding   The state and local governments do not have the resources to be able to attend to the substantial damage that affected both public and private property   Consequently  it is important that federal assistance be made available as soon as possible to help with the ongoing recovery effort in Iroquois and Livingston Counties   Mr  President  we respectfully request that you make the necessary declaration so that the State of Illinois and the affected counties can receive federal disaster assistance   We thank you in advance for your timely consideration of this important appeal and stand ready to assist in any way appropriate   Sincerely    Barack Obama                                       U S  Senator

     CONTACT Michael Ortiz  Obama   Jordan Stark  Hagel   or Max Gleischman  Durbin   16 million increase would bolster IAEA s efforts to prevent nuclear weapons from falling into the wrong hands WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Chuck Hagel  R NE  and Dick Durbin  D IL  today applauded the Senate Appropriations Committee for agreeing to increase support for the International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA  by  16 million  In March  the senators called for an increase of  10 million for the IAEA to improve its ability to keep nuclear weapons out of the wrong hands by bolstering its analytic capability and its efforts to help countries to secure nuclear material  An increase in support for the IAEA is one of a broad set of measures called for in a bill introduced last year by Obama and Hagel to sustain U S  leadership in a cooperative global effort to prevent nuclear terrorism  reduce global nuclear arsenals  and stop the spread of nuclear weapons and related technology   Keeping nuclear weapons and material out of the hands of terrorists and rogue states is a vital national security priority   said Senator Obama   We need to build and sustain a truly global effort  including providing ample resources for the world s nuclear watchdog agency  to ensure that stockpiles of nuclear material are secure and to prevent additional countries from acquiring nuclear weapons   I applaud the Senate Appropriations Committee for its decision to provide additional support to the IAEA to help keep the world s most dangerous weapons from falling into the wrong hands    It is in every nation s interest to strengthen the IAEA s capability to promote nuclear nonproliferation   These additional funds will expand and accelerate the IAEA s efforts to assist countries with securing nuclear materials while helping upgrade technical analysis of samples obtained during inspections   Sustained engagement with our international partners on nuclear nonproliferation will be required to address one of the great challenges of the 21st century   said U S  Senator Chuck Hagel  R NE    Preventing the spread of nuclear weapons is vital to our national security and global stability   Durbin said   These funds will ensure that the agency charged with checking the spread of nuclear weapons and weapon components  the International Atomic Energy Agency  has the tools and resources to continue this important work  It s not just in our nation s best interest that IAEA is able to fulfill its mission   it s a global imperative   The text of the March 28  2008 letter is below  March 28  2008 The Honorable Patrick Leahy  Chairman  Subcommittee on  State  Foreign Operations  and Related Programs  Senate Committee on Appropriations  Washington  DC  20510 The Honorable Judd Gregg  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on  State  Foreign Operations  and Related Programs  Senate Committee on Appropriations   Washington  DC  20510 Dear Mr  Chairman and Senator Gregg  We respectfully request that you increase the FY2009 budget for Nonproliferation  Anti terrorism  Demining and Related Programs  NADR  to provide an additional  10 million for voluntary contributions to the International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA  to improve its ability to keep nuclear weapons out of the wrong hands by bolstering its analytic capability and its efforts to help countries to secure nuclear material   We know Al Qaeda has made it a goal to acquire a nuclear weapon  If a sophisticated terrorist group obtained the right amount of plutonium or highly enriched uranium  it could potentially construct a crude nuclear device that could destroy the heart of any major city in the United States  While significant progress has been made in securing nuclear materials  there are still large stockpiles that remain vulnerable to theft  The IAEA plays an important role in keeping nuclear materials out of the wrong hands by providing international guidelines for improving security and assisting countries with implementation of these guidelines  Yet the IAEA s efforts in this area are chronically constrained by a small budget and an undersized staff  Increasing the voluntary contribution for nuclear security by  5 million in FY2009 would enable the IAEA to expand and accelerate its critical efforts to help secure nuclear materials  The IAEA also plays a key role in international nonproliferation efforts by conducting inspections of nuclear facilities to ensure that nuclear material is not being diverted for military purposes  The other  5 million of the additional funding should be used to strengthen the capabilities of the IAEA s Safeguards Analytical Laboratory  which provides technical analysis of samples obtained during inspections  The laboratory s infrastructure is aging and the additional funding would play an important role in upgrading the laboratory so it can meet future requirements  We believe that the additional funding for the IAEA represents a sound investment in enhancing our national security  The U S  contribution to the IAEA was included in the highest rating category for effectiveness in a review of government programs conducted by the U S  Office of Management and Budget due to substantial progress in achieving sound long term goals  Thank you for your consideration of this request  Sincerely  Barack Obama

County  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today requested assistance from the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  in responding to the infestation   Assistance may include resources for surveillance activities  deploying traps  setting up and enforcing compliance agreements and quarantine areas   We are writing to inform you of the recent discovery of Emerald Ash Borer  EAB  in Bloomington  Illinois  and to ask for your assistance in responding to this infestation   wrote the Illinois Senators    With more than 60 miles between discoveries  responding adequately to this infestation will require additional resources   This discovery is particularly troubling given the destructive power of the Emerald Ash Borer and the significant distance between this discovery and the previous southernmost discovery in Peru  Illinois     Last week  Durbin  a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved  32 5 million for nationwide efforts to combat and prevent the spread of the Emerald Ash Borer  EAB    This funding represents an increase from the   30 7 million in last year s final Agriculture Appropriations bill    Additionally  the bill includes special language directing the US Department of Agriculture s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to work collaboratively with the City of Chicago to manage the infestation and provide appropriate resources   The Emerald Ash Borer  which has now been found in Cook County  DuPage County  Kane County  LaSalle County  McLean County and Will County  is a bright green beetle that kills trees by burrowing into their bark and destroying the trees  ability to bring water from the roots to upper branches  The bug is able to cause significant damage in a limited amount of time   infected trees usually begin to die within two to three years   Timely and concerted management efforts are vital to slow the spread of the infestation  Since it was first discovered in Michigan in 2002  the Emerald Ash Borer has killed more than 30 million trees and has spread to Indiana  Ohio  Maryland  Virginia  Pennsylvania  West Virginia and Illinois  text of letter below July 21  2008   The Honorable Ed Schafer  Secretary  U S  Department of Agriculture   1400 Independence Ave   SW  Washington  DC 20250 Dear Secretary Schafer  We are writing to inform you of the recent discovery of Emerald Ash Borer  EAB  in Bloomington  Illinois  and to ask for your assistance in responding to this infestation   The Illinois Department of Agriculture announced this afternoon that the invasive pest was found in McLean County    This discovery is particularly troubling given the destructive power of the Emerald Ash Borer and the significant distance between this discovery and the previous southernmost discovery in Peru  Illinois   With more than 60 miles between discoveries  responding adequately to this infestation will require additional resources   For example  it is likely that surveillance activities will need to be increased around McLean County  requiring additional personnel   If the beetle has spread to areas between Peru and Bloomington  a significant increase in resources will be needed to manage the spread of this pest      As you know  since it was first discovered in Michigan in 2002  the Emerald Ash Borer has killed more than 30 million trees and has spread to Indiana  Ohio  Maryland  Virginia  Pennsylvania  West Virginia and Illinois   The bug is able to cause significant damage in a limited amount of time  which means that timely and concerted management efforts are vital to slow the spread of the infestation    Thankfully  the U S  Department of Agriculture has established a productive partnership with the Illinois Department of Agriculture  and progress has been made in providing resources to the state through a federal state cooperative agreement   In addition  Congress has provided additional resources to USDA s EAB program  which have been used to develop new EAB management techniques and technologies  We ask that you seriously consider the funding needs of the State of Illinois in

Bond  Shana Marchio   Boxer  Natalie Ravitz  Lieberman  Rob Sawicki  Obama  Ben LaBolt    WASHINGTON  D C      A bipartisan group of U S  Senators led by Senators Kit Bond  R MO   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Joseph Lieberman  I CT   and Barack Obama  D IL   today asked Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to launch a full review of the personality disorder discharge process across the Armed Forces     The Senators  who have been examining the mental health care treatment of service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan  recently became alarmed over reports about the inappropriate use of personality disorder discharges     The use of a personality discharge can result in a loss of disability benefits and medical care from the VA  and can even lead to service members having to repay thousands of dollars in re enlistment bonuses    Bond  Boxer  Lieberman and Obama expressed concern with a process that is diagnosing thousands of service members with long and honorable military careers with    pre existing    personality disorders that have only emerged after combat service in Iraq and Afghanistan       Recent reports about the abuse of personality disorder discharges are inexcusable   It is critical we act now and work to restore the confidence of our service members     said Senator Kit Bond      The men and women who put their lives on the line to defend our nation     and our freedoms     deserve the highest quality care      Sen  Boxer said     It appears as if the military is using    personality disorder discharges    to avoid covering the healthcare needs of our service members  many of whom are suffering from PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury as a result of their service in Iraq and Afghanistan   This is immoral and has to stop          We have an obligation to ensure that our service members are accurately diagnosed and treated for their psychological wounds     Senator Lieberman said      We cannot afford to do anything less  I urge the Department of Defense to review its policies to ensure that service members are not being inappropriately discharged          Reports that the Department of Defense is abusing its personality discharge procedures are especially troubling given the thousands of American service members we know to be suffering from less visible  service related psychological injuries     said Senator Obama      The Department of Defense must conduct a comprehensive review of its personality disorder discharge procedures and its mental health care system  to ensure that service members who have risked everything and now suffer from a mental health condition receive the treatment  care  and benefits they deserve      Bond  Boxer  Lieberman and Obama were joined by 26 of their Senate colleagues

sent the following letter to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates asking him to conduct an independent review of the discharge process  to implement appropriate measures to prevent abuse of the process  and to support the creation of a Special Discharge Review Board to assist in reviewing petitions from military personnel who have already been discharged for personality disorders and who have honorable service records in Iraq and Afghanistan   The Honorable Dr  Robert M  Gates  Secretary of Defense  The Pentagon  Washington  D C   20301 Dear Secretary Gates  We urge you to conduct a thorough and independent review of the personality disorder discharge process across the Armed Forces  We are concerned over continuing reports from Veterans    Service Organizations  the media  and individual U S  service personnel that personality disorder discharges have been implemented inappropriately and inconsistently  There are indications that personality disorder discharges are being used as a tool to discharge expeditiously U S  service personnel who have service connected injuries  such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  or Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI   Even more troubling is the perception that the U S  military is using these discharges to avoid disability and medical benefits payments   The Washington Post deftly illustrated an example of this problem on June 17  2007  in a piece entitled    The War Inside     According to the Post   after serving a combat tour in Iraq   Army Specialist Jeans Cruz returned to Ft  Hood  Texas  crippled by the mental anguish of his combat experience  Notes from his medical files indicate    major depression     and    anger from Iraq  nightmares  flashbacks     The Army was so concerned that it even went so far as to have Spc  Cruz sign a    Life Maintenance Agreement     a document stating that he agreed    not to harm himself or anyone else     But the Army ultimately discharged Spc  Cruz with a    personality disorder     in essence finding that Spc  Cruz   s medical problems had nothing to do with his service in Iraq   Since personality disorder discharges are considered    pre existing     personnel discharged under these provisions cannot collect disability benefits and may not receive medical care from the Department of Veterans Affairs for these    pre existing    illnesses  Spc  Cruz experienced this first hand  On August 16  2006  Spc  Cruz received a letter from the VA stating that he had been denied disability pay   To make matters worse  military personnel given a personality disorder discharge who have not fulfilled their service contracts can find themselves forced to repay thousands of dollars in re enlistment bonuses back to the federal government  This can result in debilitating debt for military personnel and their families   many of whom supported our forces over many years of service and endured significant strain as a result of frequent and protracted combat deployments   Defense Department records indicate that over 22 500 personality disorder discharges have been processed within the past six years  While this represents a small percentage of overall discharges  their inappropriate use and debilitating impact on personnel once discharged is cause for grave concern   Another egregious example of misuse was chronicled by reporter Joshua Kors on March 29  2007  in a piece entitled     How Specialist Town Lost his Benefits     A copy of the article is attached for your review   On October 19  2004  Spc  Jon Town was injured and sustained major loss of hearing in a rocket attack in Ramadi  Iraq  His injuries ultimately resulted in memory loss and depression  ending his military career  But instead of sending Spc  Town through the medical board process   an in depth medical review of a service member   s fitness that often results in the award of disability payments and allows injured personnel and their families to remain eligible for medical benefits after active service ends   the command at Ft  Carson  Colorado  elected to give Spc  Town a personality disorder discharge  This action deprived Spc  Town of disability benefits and guaranteed VA care for his injuries once he was discharged from the Army   While the Army claims to have thoroughly evaluated and reviewed the Town case  we understand that neither Spc  Town nor his fellow soldiers  who were aware of the rocket attack and his resulting injuries  were contacted to discuss the case  Hence in this situation  and we fear potentially in others  the Army review was inadequate and anything but thorough  Consequently  serious questions remain unanswered about the use  or abuse  of the personality disorder discharge and a chain of command that allows the inappropriate use of the discharge to continue even as members of Congress from both parties seek to review the practice and the media points out the glaring inconsistencies in the manner in which the personality discharge is administered   Like many veterans    advocates  we are skeptical about an administrative process that suddenly diagnoses military personnel who have long and honorable military careers  such as Spc  Cruz and Spc  Town  with pre existing personality disorders that reportedly become apparent only after combat service in Iraq and Afghanistan  We are particularly concerned that combat forces at the unit level and above are inadequately equipped to diagnose  treat  and work with personnel assessed with brain related injuries  and that the mechanisms tasked with handling the discharge process and meeting unit manning requirements are also overwhelmed   Therefore  we urge you to conduct a thorough and independent review of the personality discharge process and to implement appropriate measures to prevent the repeat of cases like Spc  Cruz   s and Spc  Town   s in the future  We also urge you to support the creation of a Special Discharge Review Board to assist the Board for Correction of Military Records for each service in reviewing petitions from personnel discharged for personality disorders with honorable service records in Iraq and Afghanistan   As the Walter Reed Army Medical Center hearings demonstrated  the American people will not tolerate substandard treatment and rehabilitative care for those who have served  As members of the United States Senate  we have an obligation to ensure that our service personnel and their families receive the benefits and care they are entitled to  We are eager to work with the Department of Defense on the issues we have outlined and look forward to hearing from you  Should your staff have additional questions  please direct them to James Pitchford of Sen  Bond   s staff or Ann Norris of Sen  Boxer   s staff                                   ,Obama

Washington  D C      U S  Senators Russ Feingold  D WI  and Barack Obama  D IL  are pushing for Congress to produce the strongest ethics and lobby reform bill possible   Feingold and Obama are urging several Senate leaders  who will play important roles in the bill   s fate as the Senate prepares to negotiate the final bill with the House of Representatives  to include several key provisions that passed the Senate but were left out of the House version of the bill   Feingold and Obama were two of the main architects of the Senate bill which passed in January with broad bipartisan support   Senate Majority Leader Reid hailed the bill as one of the most significant pieces of legislation dealing with ethics and lobbying reform in our nation   s history   Also signing the letter were all of the freshmen Democratic Senators including Senators Brown  D OH   Cardin  D MD   Casey  D PA   Klobuchar  D MN   McCaskill  D MO   Sanders  I VT   Tester  D MT   Webb  D VA   and Whitehouse  D RI   who made cleaning up Washington crucial parts of their successful campaigns       The public voted for change last November in part because people were sick and tired of the way Washington works     Feingold said      Without provisions like a strong lobbyist gift ban  and tough restrictions on privately funded travel and corporate jet flights  the bill won   t do enough to change the status quo in Washington          Last November  the American people sent a message to Washington to clean up its act  so it   s important that Congress take tough action on lobbying and ethics reform     said Senator Obama      Since donors are now limited in the amount of money they can contribute to candidates  the greatest measure of influence is how much an individual raises   The final ethics bill must require that candidates disclose those who have bundled contributions for their campaigns  so that we can expose the link between lobbyists who are raising campaign cash in exchange for votes on legislation and start changing the way Washington works        The text of the letter reads     June 21  2007 The Honorable Harry Reid  Majority Leader  The Honorable Mitch McConnell  Minority Leader The Honorable Dianne Feinstein  Chairman  Committee on Rules and Administration  The Honorable Robert Bennett  Ranking Member  Committee on Rules and Administration The Honorable Joseph Lieberman  Chairman  Committee on Homeland Security   Government Affairs  The Honorable Susan Collins  Ranking Member  Committee on Homeland Security   Government Affairs Dear Senators Reid  McConnell  Feinstein  Bennett  Lieberman  and Collins   At the beginning of the 110th Congress  the Senate worked diligently in a bipartisan fashion to pass a strong lobbying and ethics reform bill aimed at changing the culture of political Washington   That bill  known as S  1  included several provisions that we view as vital   We urge you to ensure that the Senate conferees on S  1 champion these Senate passed provisions and seek to include them in the final bill brought back to the Senate floor   In particular  we believe that the following provisions must be included in the final bill if the Congress is to fulfill its promise to deliver to the American people a lobbying and ethics reform measure that constitutes real reform and will lead to real change   A strong lobbyist gift ban     The Senate bill includes a modification to the Senate Rules to prohibit lobbyists and organizations that employ or retain lobbyists from giving gifts  including free meals and tickets  to members of Congress and their staffs   This provision must not be weakened   Restrictions on corporate jet flights     The Senate bill requires Senators to pay the charter rate when flying on corporate jets for personal  campaign  or official purposes   All components of this provision must be retained   The changes to the Federal Election Campaign Act included in the Senate bill  but not the House bill  are essential so that incumbents and challengers in congressional races are treated equally   Disclosure of political contributions and bundling by lobbyists     With gifts banned  the Senate bill requires disclosure of the various ways that lobbyists can legally provide financial assistance to elected officials   This includes contributions to campaign committees  lawmaker   s charities or entities designated by a lawmaker  Presidential libraries  inaugural committees  and events to honor or educate elected officials   To make sure the public has a complete picture of the financial ties between legislators and lobbyists  the provision requiring disclosure of participation in fundraising events and of contributions collected or arranged for lawmakers must also be included   Revolving door amendments     Current revolving door restrictions have proven ineffective in preventing members of Congress from profiting on their public service and gaining undue lobbying access to their former colleagues   The Senate bill increases the    cooling off period    for members of Congress from one year to two years    By contrast  the House bill does not change the current cooling off period    The Senate bill also expands the activities that former members must refrain from during that period   Finally  senior staff are prohibited for one year from making lobbying contacts with the entire house of Congress for which they worked  instead of just the employing office   All three of these components are important to restoring public confidence in Congress and should be included in the conference report   Limits on privately funded travel     Following the lead of the House  which significantly changed its travel rules in January  the Senate bill includes provisions designed to ensure that lobbyists and organizations that employ lobbyists do not pay for multi day trips that the public often sees as boondoggles   The Senate bill permits legitimate educational trips paid for by groups that do not lobby and one day trips to give speeches or attend events related to official business   Elaborate trips were central to the Jack Abramoff scandal  and these new rules must not be weakened in conference   Lavish convention parties     The Senate bill contains a rule change that prohibits Senators from attending events held in their honor and paid for by lobbyists or entities that employ or retain lobbyists at the national party conventions   These events have come to symbolize both the excess and the access of some lobbyist lawmaker relationships   This provision should be included in the conference report   Greater transparency in the legislative process     The Senate bill contains a number of provisions to open the legislative process to greater public scrutiny and understanding  including ending the practice of secret Senate holds  making conference reports available on the Internet at least 48 hours before voting on them  providing a 60 vote point of order against conference report items outside the scope of the conference  prohibiting    dead of night    additions to conference reports  and earmark reforms   These provisions must be retained in the final bill   We believe that a strong lobbying and ethics reform bill can help change the way politics is conducted and policy is pursued in Washington  thereby increasing public confidence in Congress   The Senate   s work in January gave the public hope that real reform could actually occur on a bipartisan basis   We strongly urge you to make sure that those hopes aren   t dashed in this last stage of the legislative process   We look forward to working with you to pass a final bill of which the Senate  and the public  can be proud   Sincerely     Russ Feingold  D WI   Barack Obama  D

Asian Carp Barrier   7 500 000 The State of Illinois has been working closely with the Chicago District and other Great Lakes agencies at both the federal and state level to keep Asian Carp from reaching the Great Lakes through the Chicago Waterway system  Funding will fulfill a Project Cooperation Agreement with the Corps to construct a second  more effective and permanent electrical barrier in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal   Army Corps of Engineers in the Chicago District of Illinois  to support Operations and Maintenance of the permanent Asian Carp Barrier   1 000 000 Funding the operation and maintenance of the Asian Carp Barrier is essential to prevent the introduction of Asian Carp  primarily Silver and Bighead Carp  into the Great Lakes ecosystem  The value of the Great Lakes fishery is estimated at around  4 5 billion year  and experts have predicted that Asian Carp  if allowed to become established in the Great Lakes  would have devastating effects on important fish species such as Lake Trout  Perch and Salmon  An additional and very important benefit from the operation of this barrier is that it will still allow unimpeded navigation between the Illinois Waterway and Great Lakes   Army Corps of Engineers in the City of Rock Island  to support construction of Sunset Marina Harbor Entrance Improvements   500 000 The Sunset Marina Harbor Entrance Study  prepared by the Army Corps of Engineers  concluded that it would be cost effective to protect the harbor entrance by constructing an emergent dike  This new structure would deflect much of the silt past the entrance and reduce the harbor dredging frequency from about once every 3 years to once every 7 years   Army Corps of Engineers in Illinois  to support project UMR IWW System Navigation Study  IL  IA  MN  MO    WI   24 000 000 Pre Construction Engineering   Design  PED  of seven new 1 200 foot lock chambers and ecosystem restoration   Timely PED work for navigation is consistent with a recent study indicating that without new 1 200 foot lock chambers at the identified seven locations  American farmers stand to lose over  562 million annually in lost exports and domestic demand by 2020   Manufacturers and consumers also stand to lose from deteriorating infrastructure on our   Third Coast  in addition to the 400 000 jobs sustained by this transportation corridor   Construction of these new lock chambers will create at least 48 million man hours  or up to 6 000 construction jobs each year  providing immediate economic benefits through high skilled labor  and spurring much needed economic growth that has historically occurred through investing in our lock and dam infrastructure   Aurora University  to the Center for Latino Leadership and Education   400 000  Funding

                      CONTACT  Jos   Dante Parra  Honda  or Michael Ortiz  Obama   Bill will strengthen federal agency education programs in the STEM fields WASHINGTON  D C    Rep  Mike Honda and Sen  Barack Obama today introduced a bipartisan bill in their respective chambers that will make America s students and future labor force more competitive in science related fields  The bill was introduced at a time when other countries are gaining ground on America in science and technology fields  Obama  D IL  and Honda  D CA  said this bill will help develop a coordinated strategy in the teaching of science  technology  engineering and math education  the fields collectively known as STEM  The  Enhancing Science  Technology  Engineering and Mathematics Education Act of 2008   H R  6104  will create mechanisms for federal agencies and the states to coordinate STEM education strategies   We need to focus our efforts in teaching the scientists and engineers of tomorrow   said Honda  a former science teacher and educator of more than 30 years   Federal agencies unfortunately are not communicating among themselves  Current federal efforts in STEM education are neither coordinated  nor coherent  nor cooperative  This bill will create the mechanisms and venue for cooperative relationships to develop    We must ensure our nation remains a global leader in scientific advancement and technological innovation  and that begins with strengthening America s schools   said Obama    Our students deserve the education and skills they need to compete in today s global economy and to understand the increasingly complex issues that face our democracy  and we must do everything we can to provide them with the resources and curriculum they need to succeed   This critical legislation will help students develop critical thinking and effective problem solving skills in science  technology  engineering and mathematics by coordinating federal STEM education efforts  consolidating federal education initiatives  and supporting states in collaboratively organizing their efforts   I am proud to introduce this legislation with Congressman Honda  and look forward to moving it forward in Congress    Among the bill s original co sponsors are Rep  George Miller  chairman of the House Committee on Labor and Education  Rep  Vernon Ehlers  R MI   and Rep  Rush Holt  D NJ    In 2006  the federal government sponsored 105 STEM education programs through 15 different federal agencies at a cost of  3 12 billion  Yet the following year  American students did poorly in a test offered world wide that measures student proficiency in understanding and applying science  Microsoft s Bill Gates summarized the concerns when he said   When I compare our high schools with what I see when I m traveling abroad  I m terrified for our workforce of tomorrow   Honda s and Obama s bill would   Reorganize the President s Office of Science and Technology Policy  OSTP   OSTP has a STEM subcommittee that has remained largely dormant over the past few years  The bill would raise that subcommittee to a committee level  giving it a mandate to work proactively at designing coherent STEM strategies  Create an Office of STEM at the U S  Department of Education at the assistant secretary level  This office will coordinate STEM education initiatives among all federal agencies and have a seat at the OSTP STEM Committee  Institute a voluntary Consortium on STEM education  The Consortium would be integrated by no less than five states representing at least five of the nation s nine geographical regions  Its mission is to develop common content standards for K 12 STEM education  engineered at the state and local levels  Create the National STEM Education Research Repository  This would be a clearing house for educators to research the latest innovations in STEM  This will break the silos that keep creative programs from being replicated    Our nation s competitiveness in the global economy depends largely on our ability to graduate students who excel in the fields of science  technology  engineering and math   Ehlers said   We must do all that we can as a nation to prepare students at every grade level so that they have a genuine interest and demonstrated skills in these fields  The jobs of tomorrow will require STEM education skills and our next generation of innovators will need them to succeed   For educators  this bill promises to create tools and make available resources that are now scattered and isolated among federal agencies and the states   The Enhancing Science  Technology  Engineering  and Math Education Act of 2008 will coordinate and enhance STEM education programs at the federal level and empower states to better address the critical needs in their STEM education systems   said Gerald Wheeler  Executive Director of the National Science Teachers Association   We are pleased to support this legislation    As the American economy attempts to recover from a deep economic downturn  losing sight of long term strategies to manage the economy can be risky  said Rep  Rush Holt    Scientists and educators should not be the only ones concerned about STEM education  Those who care about our long term economic health and the ability of future generations to compete in a new global economy should be concerned   Holt said   This legislation is part of our strategy to get STEM education back on track at a time when we can no longer afford to lose ground to our competitors                                 Pursuant to

Senators Urge GAO to Study the Military s Mental Health Care Thursday  April 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact  Ben LaBolt  Obama  Boxer  Bond  Akaka  Harkin  Lieberman  Murray  McCaskill  Sanders ask for review in light of troubling reports  WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Kit Bond  R MO   Daniel K  Akaka  D HI   Tom Harkin  D IA   Joe Lieberman  I CT   Patty Murray  D WA   Claire McCaskill  D MO   and Bernie Sanders  I VT  today sent a letter to the General Accounting Office  GAO  requesting a review of the Department of Defense   s treatment of service related mental health conditions affecting troops that have served in Iraq and Afghanistan   The letter comes in the wake of reports of poor treatment and conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Centers  where many patients and family members described not receiving adequate mental health care  and more recent reports that suggest the Department of Defense  DOD  has not effectively screened and diagnosed mental health conditions   Senators Boxer  Bond  and Obama had previously asked that the Department of Defense to examine command practices and culture related to mental health care with no response   As the DOD drags its feet  the senators have requested the GAO to investigate agency practices related to mental health screenings  diagnoses  referrals and treatment of service members    Recent reports suggest that the Department of Defense is ill equipped to effectively screen and diagnose the increasing number of service members who are suffering from mental health conditions such as post traumatic stress disorder     said Senator Obama      I m especially troubled by reports of some DOD commanders downplaying the serious mental health conditions confronting service members returning home from Iraq  and then redeploying those troops without proper treatment    It s time for a full accounting of how many of our troops are affected by post traumatic stress disorder  other service connected mental health conditions  and traumatic brain injuries  and for an evaluation of our readiness to help the generation of soldiers returning home from war rebuild their lives    Senator Boxer said   Two years ago  military doctors informed me that soldiers with serious mental health problems were being denied care and redeployed to Iraq   Sadly  even after we passed legislation and the Defense Department issued new mental health guidelines  they are not being followed   It is time for the GAO to investigate allegations of mistreatment and improper discharges   The health and well being of our service members must be a priority for the Pentagon and for all Americans        Combat stress and its impact on our soldiers and their families is a serious problem that continues to grow   Reports that our military is unprepared or unwilling to deal with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome or other mental health problems are unacceptable   Being unprepared for these problems is no excuse for inaction  It is our duty to take care of the brave men and women who have answered the call to duty   said Senator Kit Bond       I am deeply concerned about the consequences of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan on the mental health of those who serve     said Senator Akaka      PTSD and other mental health problems  the often invisible wounds of war  can be terribly debilitating   As a senior member of the Armed Services Committee and Chairman of the Veterans    Affairs Committee  I am working to ensure that our wounded warriors receive a timely diagnosis of mental health problems and prompt and effective response   This effort must begin while servicemembers are still on active duty and there have been far too many reports that this is not happening   The results of this requested GAO review will be of great importance as we seek to ensure that DOD and VA meet the needs of our newest war veterans          With news that our soldiers will be serving longer tours of duty with shorter periods of rest at home  there is no better time to ensure the men and women who serve our country are getting the mental health services they need     said Senator Harkin     We must do away with the stigma associated with mental illness and remove any obstacles to treatment          We have a moral obligation to care for our wounded troops and ensure they receive the best care     said Senator Lieberman      Post traumatic stress disorder is afflicting many of our service members and it is imperative that we accurately and efficiently diagnose and treat it  The stakes are high for those that are sacrificing their lives for our country and we must work together to correct any deficiencies that we find in our military   s mental health system       We can t afford to wait until a year after our service members have returned home to discover the affects of the unseen wounds of this war   said Senator Murray   PTSD is taking a horrible toll on our service members and their families and we must be sure today that they are being properly screened  tracked  and treated  We can no longer be unprepared for this mounting problem        Our men and women returning from war should receive mental health care equal to the physical medical care they are given  and anything less is unacceptable     Senator McCaskill said      It took this country 15 years after Vietnam to look at the mental health needs of veterans   We can   t do that to another generation of soldiers          The men and women who put their lives on the line for this country deserve the best care we can provide     Senator Bernie Sanders said      What has been revealed about Defense Department health care is a disgrace that needs to be addressed   We need to find out whether there is a concerted effort by the Defense Department to shortchange our soldiers and veterans who are in need of mental health care and other benefits they have earned      The text of the letter is below  The Honorable David M  Walker   Comptroller General   Government Accountability Office  GAO    441 G Street  NW  Room 7125   Washington  DC 20548  Dear Mr  Walker    We are writing to request that the General Accounting Office  GAO  undertake a review of Department of Defense  DOD  screenings  diagnoses  referrals and treatment of service members who may have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  and other mental health conditions related to their service in Iraq and Afghanistan   Several of us previously wrote the DOD requesting an examination of command practices and reports of biases and misdiagnoses in the treatment of mental health related injuries such as PTSD and other deployment related health problems  including Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI   but have not yet received a response    The stigmas associated with PTSD and other mental health needs are no less potent within the military than in the civilian world   Indeed  reports from soldiers suffering from PTSD suggest that the stigma is worse  with some military commanders appearing to minimize the significance of PTSD and other mental health needs  or suggesting that a service member is malingering to avoid redeployment   There are allegations of commanders at Fort Carson  Colorado denying soldiers access to mental health care and instead ordering them redeployed for additional tours in Iraq   We have also heard of cases in which service members with PTSD are diagnosed as having    personality disorders    that the Army considers    pre existing     thus depriving otherwise eligible combat veterans of disability benefits and much needed mental healthcare  Because the stakes for our service members    and their health are so high  we must move quickly to investigate and correct any deficiencies   We have come to learn about a number of upsetting allegations at Fort Carson   Therefore  for the purposes of an expedited review  we request to be briefed initially by GAO on these immediate cases   We ask that you subsequently focus your inquiry not only on Fort Carson but on system wide mental health deficiencies within the DOD   With the significant burdens already being placed on our service members and their families with multiple extended deployments  we must ensure that they are not further burdened with any humiliation  stigmatization or other minimization of genuine mental health needs  Our service members are risking their lives for our nation   s security  it is our moral obligation to care for them  We therefore ask the GAO to assess    Known cases of improper discharges or misdiagnoses and patterns of systematic stigmatization employed by military commanders regarding the mental health needs of service members throughout the chain of command at Fort Carson and across DOD departments   The growing number of discharges for personality disorders  and whether or not such discharges are being improperly used when service members should in fact be given a mental health diagnosis that DOD does not consider preexisting   The overall number of misdiagnosed cases of PTSD  other mental health conditions  and TBIs  at Fort Carson and force wide    DOD progress in implementing previous mandates to develop force wide criteria and procedures for screening  diagnosing and referring mental health cases for follow up treatment   The efficacy of the DOD   s current mental health safety net and treatment capabilities  for example  what current mechanisms are available to service members in the event of misdiagnosis    The steps and resources required to implement one on one  face to face mental health screenings for all returning service members    The number of service members  men and women  reporting mental health concerns related to sexual assault during deployment  and whether current DOD personnel training and diagnostic guidance is sufficiently responsive to the needs of both men and women    We seek to ensure that the DOD has the resources necessary to diagnose and treat service connected injuries that impact the mental health of U S  service personnel  It is vital that the U S  military ensures it is treating the mental health needs of our forces with the same priority and resource investments it is devoting to physical injuries   If you would like to discuss this request  please contact  redacted   Thank you for your assistance in this matter                                   ,Obama

Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  and Congressman Don Manzullo  R IL  today asked President Bush to declare Winnebago County and Stephenson County a federal disaster area after severe flooding hit the area earlier this month  Durbin  Obama and Manzullo made their request in a letter to the President today   In the letter  the Illinois lawmakers supported Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich   s request last night for federal disaster assistance   The Illinois Emergency Management Agency is now coordinating the state   s efforts       We are writing in support of Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich   s request for a major disaster declaration for Winnebago County and Stephenson County as a result of flooding beginning August 7 and continuing through August 8  2007     the Illinois members wrote      We respectfully request that you make the necessary declaration so that the residents of Winnebago County and Stephenson County can receive federal disaster assistance     If the state   s request for federal assistance is approved  communities could apply for Individual Assistance and Hazard Mitigation Assistance   Individual Assistance includes aid to individuals and households which can include cash grants to help with temporary housing  home repairs and replacement  and other disaster related costs   Hazard Mitigation Assistance includes funding for measures designed to reduce future losses to public and private property    Hazard mitigation opportunities are assessed in most situations   Additionally  small business administration loans can be provided under an    SBA disaster assistance    declaration by the SBA Administrator even if the President denies the major disaster declaration and includes three types of loans to qualified homeowners and businesses   home disaster loans to homeowners and renters  business physical disaster loans to business owners and economic injury disaster loans to small businesses and small agricultural cooperatives   A federal disaster declaration includes SBA assistance under the Individual Assistance program at FEMA   text of letter below   August 22  2007 President George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  D C  20500 Dear Mr  President  We are writing in support of Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich   s request for a major disaster declaration for Winnebago County and Stephenson County as a result of flooding beginning August 7 and continuing through August 8  2007    Preliminary assessments indicate that homes and businesses located in the path of the rapidly rising flood water in the City of Freeport in Stephenson County and the Village of Cherry Valley and the City of Rockford in Winnebago County received the most severe impacts of the flash flooding   These homes and businesses sustained structural damage to basements  foundations  and first floor living areas   The electrical  heating  air conditioning and ventilation systems in hundreds of homes sustained major damage   Governor Blagojevich declared Winnebago County a disaster area on August 7  2007 and declared Stephenson County a disaster area on August 8  2007    The damage assessment found that 820 single or multi family homes were impacted by the floodwaters  many sustaining major damage   Specifically  245 single family homes and 52 multi family homes were affected by floodwaters  73 single family homes and 43 multi family homes sustained major damage  and 274 single family homes and 121 multi family homes suffered minor damage   Twelve single family homes were destroyed  This is the second time in eleven months that the same area in Winnebago County  primarily in the City of Rockford  has been devastated by a flash flood   Governor Blagojevich   s request for disaster assistance regarding the previous flood and his subsequent appeal were denied   As the community is still struggling to recover from last year   s Labor Day flash flood  the need for federal disaster assistance is greater      We respectfully request that you make the necessary declaration so that the residents of Winnebago County and Stephenson County can receive federal disaster assistance   Specifically  we support the Governor   s request for Individual Assistance  including the Individuals and Households Program  and Small Business disaster loans   We also support the request for Hazard Mitigation Assistance for all counties statewide   We thank you in advance for your timely consideration of this important request and stand ready to assist in any appropriate way  Sincerely     Richard Durbin  United States

to Provide Access to Voter Registration for Veterans Tuesday  July 22  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                                      CONTACT  Scott Gerber  Feinstein  or Michael Ortiz  Obama   Legislation would give veterans access to voter registration services at VA facilities    WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Dianne Feinstein  D Calif   and John Kerry  D Mass   today introduced a bill to require the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide voter registration services to veterans in the department s care  The senators introduced the legislation after receiving a response from Veterans Affairs Secretary James B  Peake earlier this month  again denying the senators  request that Secretary Peake designate VA facilities as voter registration agencies  Senators Harry Reid  D NV   Barack Obama  D Ill   Hillary Rodham Clinton  D N Y    Patrick Leahy  D VT   Chuck Schumer  D N Y    Patty Murray  D WA  and Ron Wyden  D OR  are co sponsors   This is about giving those who have fought to spread democracy and freedom the right to exercise that freedom in the voting booth   Senator Feinstein said   I believe the cost of providing voter materials is minimal  And given the sacrifices that these men and woman have made  providing easy access to voter registration services is the very least we can do     It shouldn t have taken a legislative solution to fix a bureaucratic problem  but that s what it s come down to in the name of common sense and patriotism   Senator Kerry said  Making it easier not harder for veterans to vote is the least we can do in our democracy for those who fought for democracy around the globe  The cost of getting these voter materials to veterans is tiny  but its meaning is bigger than any of us     Our nation s service members and veterans have sacrificed so much for our country on the battlefield that we cannot allow them to fight another battle here at home for the benefits and rights they deserve   said Senator Obama    Whether Americans are abroad serving in the Armed Forces  or recovering and living in VA facilities  it is critical that we ensure these brave men and women can exercise their right to vote   It is unacceptable that some veterans in VA facilities are not allowed access to voter registration services   I am proud to join Senators Feinstein and Kerry in their efforts to reverse the VA s current policies  and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and quickly move it forward    We must make it as easy as possible for all people to vote  especially the men and women who have defended that freedom for the rest of us   Senator Reid said    I urge my colleagues to support this important  common sense legislation that provides veterans easy access to the voting process     Voting is a basic right for all Americans  and we should do what we can to remove obstacles to the right to vote  particularly for those who have served this country in uniform   This legislation will help ensure that the men and women who have fought to secure our nation will have their voices heard as part of our democracy   said Senator Clinton   The nation s disabled veterans have given extraordinary service to our country and they deserve our efforts to provide the necessary help to ensure their full participation in our democracy   Senator Leahy said   I hope the Senate quickly passes this important bill  and that the House and the President will act quickly so these steps can be enacted in time for the upcoming national elections    It s always the case that the more participation we have in our elections  the better  But we have a special obligation to ensure our veterans have unfettered access to the polls  This is a simple step that will help our service members exercise the very freedoms they help defend   Senator Schumer said   The right to vote is at the very heart of the democracy that our nation s veterans have fought so hard to protect   Senator Murray said    The VA knows first hand how much our veterans have sacrificed and should make every attempt to make voting easier   not harder   for them   This legislation breaks down barriers to voting for our veterans and helps keep our commitment to protect the rights of those who have fought for us    Our nation s veterans have selflessly answered the call to serve  After being wounded defending our freedoms  many now require care at VA facilities   said Senator Wyden   We should be making it easier for them to exercise their right to vote   not harder  This bill will right that wrong   Specifically  the legislation would   Require the VA to make voter registration services available at VA facilities in states that request it  in accordance with the National Voter Registration Act   These services include providing voter registration forms  answering questions on registration issues and assisting with submitting voter registration forms   Require the VA to assist veterans at facilities to receive and use absentee ballots if they choose to vote absentee    Allow non partisan groups and election officials to provide voter information and registration information to veterans  Require an annual report to Congress from the Department of Veterans Affairs on progress related to this legislation    The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires states to offer voter registration opportunities at all offices that provide public assistance  services to the disabled and at all motor vehicle offices  The Act also allows federal agencies to provide voter registration opportunities   Background Many veterans live at VA facilities and some  especially those who are disabled  find it difficult to travel off campus for services including voter registration  However  a federal appeals court recently ruled that voter registration groups do not have the right to register veterans on the grounds of VA facilities   In light of the court decision  Senators Feinstein and Kerry wrote a letter in March to Veterans Affairs Secretary James B  Peake to find ways to ensure that all veterans have access to voter registration materials and identify the policies they have in place to support voter registration  On April 25  the Department of Veterans Affairs issued a directive that required all VA facilities to develop comprehensive voter registration plans to assist veterans in voting  It also required the VA to publicly post voter registration information for veteran facility inpatients and required that VA facilities provide absentee voter applications if patients cannot leave the facility   In May  the Department of Veterans Affairs withdrew that directive  and issued a new directive that introduced a broad prohibition against organizations conducting voter registration drives at VA facilities  including state and local election officials  In response  the senators wrote a letter to Secretary Peake  saying the new policy could discourage involvement from non partisan groups such as veterans service organizations and the League of Women Voters in helping veterans to vote   Just prior to July 4  Connecticut s Secretary of State Susan Bysiewicz attempted to provide voter information and register residents at a West Haven Veterans Affairs facility   Secretary Bysiewicz was denied entry to the VA facility under the VA s directive   Instead she sought to register veterans leaving the facility   One such veteran who was registered to vote by the Secretary was Martin Onieal  92  a World War II veteran   Mr  Onieal told her  There was nobody here to do this last year     Earlier this month  Senators Feinstein and Kerry along with Senator Daniel K  Akaka  D HI  again wrote a letter to Secretary Peake to find ways to ensure that all veterans have access to voter registration materials and identify the policies they have in place to support voter registration   Last week  Secretary Peake wrote back to the senators  denying their request to designate VA facilities as voter registration agencies  The senators today proposed the legislation in the wake of that denial

to Expand Use of Biofuels Nationwide Monday  March 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Contact  Ben LaBolt  Urges Underwriters Laboratories to certify  blender pumps  to make E85 fuels more accessible to motorists across the country  WASHINGTON     U S  Senator Barack Obama was today joined by Senators Durbin  D IL   Harkin  D IA   Lugar  R IN   Bayh  D IN   Nelson  D NE   Grassley  R IA   Klobuchar  D MN   Thune  R SD   Feingold  D WI   McCaskill  D MO   Voinovich  R OH   Brown  D OH   and Brownback  R KS  in urging Underwriters Laboratories  UL   the world s leading product safety testing organization  to complete its certification process for the multi product fuel dispensers that allow service stations to sell higher ethanol blends up to E85    an 85  ethanol 15  traditional gasoline blend   Several years ago  UL approved the use of multi product fuel dispenser components only to rescind that certification on October 5  2006  announcing it would reconsider whether to certify the dispensers even though there were no documented problems       American manufacturers are doing their part to lead the United States toward energy independence by increasing the use of biofuels  but some roadblocks remain     said U S  Senator Barack Obama      While the biofuels industry will soon produce enough ethanol to make higher fuel blends widely available to consumers  and automakers have steadily increased the production of Flexible Fuel Vehicles  just over 1 000 retailers across the nation carry E85 pumps    UL certification will remove one of the last remaining roadblocks to the widespread installation of dual fuel pumps that give motorists the choice between renewable fuels and traditional gasoline      Approximately 1 100 service stations are equipped to dispense E85 in the U S  today   Congress has enacted a federal income tax credit to offset the cost for service stations of installing of E85 fueling systems  and many states have lowered excise tax rates and provided other incentives to advance E85   But UL s decision to rescind its previously issued E85 certifications and uncertainty as to when its current certification review will be completed has caused some fire marshals  code administrators  and other officials cross the nation to block the installation of new E85 fueling systems   In their letter to Keith Williams  President and CEO of Underwriters Laboratory  the senators wrote     We appreciate that you and your staff have undertaken a new effort to establish E85 component and dispenser testing protocol  but we are extremely disappointed that this initiative is being undertaken after the withdrawal of the prior approvals      Given UL s admission that there has never been an E85 fueling system failure  a report of such failure  or even evidence of corrosion in E85 fueling systems  the decision to rescind the prior approvals while you carry out new testing is troubling     We believe it is in the national interest for UL to either re issue the prior certifications that were available to E85 dispensing equipment or document why it believes these pumps are unsafe  establish a firm timetable to complete its updated testing and analysis  and issue a revised draft protocol to industry as soon as practicable      Sen  Obama has noted that that Brazil is a prime example of a nation that has successfully expanded its infrastructure for distributing higher ethanol blends  from E30 to E85  in special pumps that allow motorists to select what blend of biofuels they want  depending upon cost and availability   Nearly all automobiles manufactured in Brazil today are FFV s  or Flexible Fuel Vehicles  which means they are designed to run efficiently on any blend of ethanol or gasoline    Twenty years from now our nation s transportation fuels sector will be powered primarily by domestically produced biofuels  if we have the vision and the will to make that happen   Obama said    Just as we sent a man to the moon  we can harness our technological skills and entrepreneurial spirit to end our dangerous reliance on foreign sources of oil   In doing so  we will not only protect our national security  we will also protect our public health  create quality jobs for the next generations  and keep billions of dollars here at home  rather than sending them to nations that want to do us harm    In his State of the Union Address last January  President Bush identified the use of higher ethanol blends  including E85  as one of the nation   s leading alternatives to hydrocarbon based transportation fuels and proposed requiring 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels be used in U S  fuels by 2017   This critical goal cannot be met without making these fuels more readily available to motorists  and  as a practical matter  that access is dependent upon UL certification of E85 dispensing equipment   A copy of the letter to Keith Williams  President and CEO of Underwriters Laboratory is embedded below  Mr  Keith Williams  President and CEO  Underwriters Laboratory  333 Pfingsten Road  Northbrook  Illinois 60062 2096 Dear Mr  Williams  We are writing in regard to the recent decision by Underwriter Laboratories  UL  to rescind its previously issued certifications for components of E85 refueling systems  and the new efforts by UL to establish E85 component and fuel dispenser testing protocols   UL initiated a review of the safety of multi product fuel dispenser components and approved their use several years ago   On October 5  2006  UL rescinded the certification for these components and announced that it would embark on an extended recertification procedure for the dispensers themselves   We understand that re evaluation of material testing protocol is not uncommon and indeed should occur in the normal course of time  and we appreciate that you and your staff have undertaken a new effort to establish E85 component and dispenser testing protocol   We are concerned  however  why this initiative is being undertaken after the withdrawal of the prior approvals     especially when UL has acknowledged no documented reports of corrosion for UL Listed or Recognized components used with E85  no field incidents related to UL Listed or Recognized components used with E85  and no reported safety issues associated with Listed or Recognized components used with E85 Moreover  the actions taken by UL have not provided equipment manufacturers  ethanol producers  and the motoring public with adequate certainty and clarity as to the timetable for completion of the process   We know and agree that any device that displays the UL imprimatur must have its characteristics fully reviewed and tested according to key

             Obama Calls on FTC to Protect America   s Seniors from Telemarketing Scams Monday  May 21  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt 202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to Federal Trade Commission  FTC  Chairman Deborah Platt Majoras raising serious concerns about whether the FTC has adequately protected America s seniors from abusive telemarketing fraud schemes  According to a report in Sunday   s New York Times  millions of our nation   s senior citizens are at risk of being robbed of their good credit standing  life savings and privacy   In the letter  Senator Obama says that while telemarketing may help seniors maintain access to products and services  seniors must be protected from exploitation  identity theft  and privacy violations   He calls on the FTC to aggressively enforce the law to ensure that the consumer protection challenges faced by vulnerable populations like seniors are addressed  The full text of the letter is below   The Honorable Deborah Platt Majoras  Chairman  Federal Trade Commission  600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W    Washington  D C  20580   Dear Chairman Majoras   Yesterday  the New York Times published an investigation into telemarketing fraud schemes that exploit vulnerable American seniors  often robbing them of their dignity  their good credit  and even the life savings and financial resources they rely on to pay for food or medication    I am writing to express my concern that the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  is not doing more to deter such schemes and to protect elderly consumers from abusive and fraudulent telemarketing practices   The New York Times story highlighted the ways in which scam artists purchase databases of names of elderly Americans    These lists include names of    Elderly Opportunity Seekers   seniors  looking for ways to make money     Suffering Seniors   people with cancer or Alzheimer s disease   and  Oldies but Goodies   gamblers over 55 years old     Armed with these lists  criminals are able to prey on vulnerable seniors     people like Iowan Richard Guthrie  a 92 year old Army veteran  who lost  100 000 from scams     There is no question that telemarketing and electronic commerce represent important ways for many seniors to participate in the economy as merchants and consumers  But there is also no question that remote transactions present new risks of privacy violations  identity theft  and exploitation of potentially vulnerable consumers     The government must ensure that consumer protection and law enforcement authorities have the right priorities  tools  technologies  and resources to keep up with the evolving threats faced by American consumers    We cannot allow our elderly parents and grandparents to be so easily preyed upon by unscrupulous data brokers and others complicit in deceptive mailings  marketing scams  and outright fraud    The FTC is charged with protecting consumers from fraud  deception  and unfair business practices  The Commission is responsible for enforcing our nation s consumer protection laws and developing rules and procedures to protect and educate consumers  Given this clear mandate  the widespread and sophisticated abuse of many seniors raises a number of questions    What if anything is the FTC doing to assess and address the particular consumer protection challenges faced by seniors or other groups of American consumers who may be especially vulnerable to abuse   In particular  what is the FTC doing to regulate the sale of telemarketing databases to companies that are under investigation or have been prosecuted for fraud   How have FTC resources been allocated to protect rising numbers of seniors who are conducting remote consumer transactions at increasing rates    Are additional resources necessary and for what priority purposes  What if any programs exist to assist seniors with questions or complaints about marketing practices of which they may have been victims    What are the utilization rates of these programs over the past ten years   Have these programs been evaluated  and with what results  Is there adequate coordination between the FTC  the Federal Reserve  and the Department of Justice to ensure effective prevention and prosecution of marketing abuse    What if any multi agency initiatives are currently underway or planned for the near future   Please give specific examples of enforcement actions that have been taken recently against data brokers  telemarketers  or enabling financial institutions   What if any changes to regulatory authority or direction are necessary to enable the FTC to fulfill its consumer protection mandate in light of evolving marketing  communication  and transaction technologies     An FTC that is aggressively enforcing the law is critical to protecting American consumers in a vibrant  fast paced economy    Please respond to the questions above by June 8  2007  I look forward to working with your office to ensure that consumers of all ages can have confidence in their conversations with telemarketers and in all their consumer transactions    Sincerely      Barack Obama  United States Senator                                   ,Obama

  Senate Passes Kerry Obama Legislation to Close KBR Tax Loophole  Provide Tax Relief for Troops   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Senate Passes Kerry Obama Legislation to Close KBR Tax Loophole  Provide Tax Relief for Troops Thursday  May 22  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Whitney Smith  Kerry  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  WASHINGTON  D C    Senators John Kerry and Barack Obama today announced that the Senate passed the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008  The  HEART Act    The Act would provide tax relief to the men and women in our nation s armed services and others volunteering service on behalf of the United States  including Peace Corps volunteers and AmeriCorps volunteers   and is paid for by the Kerry Obama tax reform that closed the tax loophole that allowed defense contractor KBR to avoid paying its fair share of taxes  The Act passed the House yesterday and now goes to the President for his signature   Kerry and Obama were instrumental in ensuring that the funds that will be used to pay for these benefits came from defense contractors that were not paying their fair share of taxes   In March  they introduced the Fair Share Act of 2008 to close the loophole that had allowed KBR to fleece the American taxpayer by almost  100 million a year  It was discovered that KBR and another defense contractor have avoided paying their fair share of Social Security and Medicare taxes by creating shell companies in the Cayman Islands  The Fair Share Act of 2008 will end the practice of U S  government contractors setting up sham companies in foreign jurisdictions to avoid payroll taxes    Now thousands of military families in Massachusetts will receive the benefits they deserve and big companies will pay their fair share of taxes rather than leaving hard working Americans with the bill   said Senator Kerry    This important bill will provide much needed tax relief to our brave service members and hold American companies accountable for paying taxes and guaranteeing that employees receive the benefits they are entitled to through their employment   said Senator Obama    For the sake of transparency and fairness in our tax system  we cannot allow Federal contractors to set up shell corporations in tax shelters and shirk their responsibility to pay payroll taxes for their American employees   I commend Senator Kerry for his leadership on behalf of America s small businesses  workers  and service members and I call on the President to sign this bill into law   The HEART Act includes several provisions included in legislation introduced by Kerry and Senator Gordon Smith  D Oregon  in January of 2007  The Active Duty Military Tax Relief of 2007 aimed to bolster military families and small businesses that employ reservists    The HEART Act would   Enable active duty military personnel to qualify for economic stimulus payments  The HEART Act would clarify that active military who file a joint tax return would be eligible for the stimulus rebate payment even if the spouse does not have a Social Security number   Make permanent the ability to include combat pay as earned income for purposes of the Earned Income Tax Credit  The earned income tax credit  EITC  is a refundable tax credit for eligible low income workers   Generally   earned income  includes taxable wages  salaries  tips  and other employee compensation   Some low income military families who receive the EITC based on taxable military pay could lose this tax credit if they begin receiving non taxable combat pay and have no other earned income on which to claim the EITC   The HEART Act would extend the provision that allows America s military men and women to count combat pay for the purposes of qualifying for the earned income tax credit   Make permanent and modify qualified mortgage bonds used to finance residences for veterans  To give our nation s brave veterans greater access to homeownership  the HEART Act would permanently extend the provision that allows veterans to qualify for state operated  tax exempt mortgage revenue bond programs  This program provides financing to provide lower income individuals without regard to the general first time home buyer requirement   Modify retirement plan protections for reservists who have given their lives in service or who are disabled while serving our country  The HEART Act would modify the Uniformed Services Employment and Re employment Rights Act to  1  allow the day prior to the date of death to be treated as the date the employee returned to work for purposes of triggering payment of benefits under a qualified plan  and 2  permit an employer to make certain contributions to a qualified pension plan on behalf of an employee who is killed or becomes disabled in combat   Modify treatment of differential wages paid by an employer to an employee who becomes active duty military  In the case of an employee who is called to active duty with the United States uniformed services  some employers voluntarily agree to continue paying the level of compensation that the service member would otherwise have received from the employer during the service member s period of active duty  This  differential pay  is not treated as wages for purposes of the federal income tax withholding rules that apply to an employer s payment of wages  The HEART Act would treat differential wages paid by an employer to an employee who becomes active duty military as wages for withholding and retirement plan purposes   Extend the period for filing tax refund credit claims arising from Department of Veterans Affairs  DVA  disability determinations  Because of the lapse of time between retirement and the determination of  or the onset and determination of  a service connected disability  the HEART ACT would extend the statute of limitations to permit retired military personnel to file claims for refunds one year after the date of the determination of a service connected disability is made   Make permanent the special rules that permit penalty free withdrawals from retirement plans  Generally  there is a ten percent withdrawal tax on early distributions from certain retirement plans   Because reservists called to active duty may need access to amounts that they have contributed to their retirement plans in order to meet their personal financial obligations while serving our country  the HEART Act would extend special rules that permit active duty reservists to make penalty free withdrawals from their retirement plans  and a reservist has two years from the last day of the active duty period to contribute distributions to an IRA   Permit recipients of military death benefit gratuities to roll over the amounts received to tax favored accounts for retirement and education savings  To enable survivors of servicemembers should be able to contribute death benefit proceeds to accounts to save for future retirement and education needs  the HEART Act would permit recipients of military death benefit gratuities to roll over the amounts received  tax free  to a Roth IRA or an Education Savings Account  and  Provide a tax credit for small employers with respect to differential wage payments to employees who are on active military duty  Many employers voluntarily eliminate any pay gap between the reservists  civilian pay and military pay by paying the difference  The proposal would treat the pay gap as wages requiring information reporting and subject the differential pay payments to withholding  The proposal would also make it easier for employers to contribute to their activated employee s retirement plans    The HEART Act would also permanently allow the Social Security Administration to disclose tax return information to the DVA for purposes of determining eligibility for certain veteran s programs  clarify that certain tax rebates and benefits are excludible from income for volunteer firefighters  clarify the application of the  five year requirement  to the sale of a principal residence by a Peace Corps volunteer  clarify that state payments to service members are treated as qualified military benefits  and provide for permanent exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence by certain employees of the intelligence community  Supplemental Social Security Income To ensure fairer treatment of military families who depend on Supplemental Security Income payments  the HEART Act would   Allow most military cash allowances beyond basic pay to be treated as earned income for purposes of determining Supplemental Security Income  SSI  eligibility and benefit amounts for military families  and treat certain housing payments as in kind support and maintenance   Disregard state annuity payments paid to blind  disabled  and aged veterans when determining SSI eligibility and benefits  and  Disregard allowances paid to all Americorps volunteers for the purpose of determining SSI eligibility and benefit amounts   Revenue Provisions  The HEART ACT would  revise tax rules on expatriation  American citizens and long term U S  residents are subject to tax on their worldwide income  Under current law  taxpayers can avoid taxes by renouncing their citizenship or terminating their residence  The Heart Act would tighten current law rules to ensure that certain high net worth taxpayers cannot renounce their citizenship or terminate their residence in order to avoid U S  taxes  Under this provision  high net worth individuals would be treated as if they sold all of their property for its fair market value on the day before such individual expatriates or their residency would be terminated  The gain would be recognized to the extent that the aggregate gain recognized exceeds  600 000  which will be adjusted for cost of living in the future    Modify treatment of certain foreign persons performing services under contract with United States  The Heart Act generally would treat foreign subsidiaries of American companies performing services under a U S  government contract as American employers for employment tax purposes  The domestic parent would be jointly liable for employment taxes imposed on the foreign subsidiary   Increase general failure to file return penalty  The Heart Act would increase the general penalty for failure to file tax returns to the lesser of  135 or 100 percent of the amount required to be shown on such return    Mental Health Parity  The HEART Act would extend current law excise tax for failure to comply with the mental health parity requirements for benefits for services furnished on or after the date of enactment through December 31  2008  Current law requires certain group health plans to provide the same coverage for mental health benefits that they provide for medical and surgical health benefits   The HEART Act would extend the imposition of a  100 per day excise tax on group health plans that fail to comply with this requirement                                  Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election      ,Obama

Obama  D IL  today introduced legislation that would require states to prepare disaster evacuation plans that account for the needs of society s most vulnerable members  including the poor  the disabled and the elderly    It is the duty of our government to keep all Americans safe in times of emergency  especially those in our society who are not always able to help themselves   said Obama   But in the days and weeks since Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast  it has become overwhelmingly clear that this was not the case  The government did not adequately prepare to evacuate those who could not afford a car  did not adequately prepare to evacuate the elderly  and did not adequately prepare to evacuate those who were too sick to leave their beds     It has been widely reported that the Hurricane Katrina evacuation plan did not adequately account for the special needs of low income populations  Obama s bill would require the Department of Homeland Security to mandate that each state include plans for the evacuation of individuals with special needs during times of emergency  These people would include low income individuals and families  the elderly  the disabled  and those who cannot speak English  The plans must consider how these people would be evacuated out of the emergency area but also how the states would provide shelter  food  and water to these people once they are evacuated  Obama s bill would require that the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security report each state s evacuation plan within one year after the legislation becomes law    What we saw in the Gulf Coast cannot be repeated   said Obama   We may not be able to control the wrath of Mother Nature  but we can control how we prepare for natural disasters     The bill is

18 other Senate Democrats in a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff asking that the Secretary ensure all evacuation plans include consideration for those in our society who are the most vulnerable  Please find full text of the letter below      September 9  2005    The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  Department of Homeland Security  Nebraska Avenue Center  NW  Washington  DC 20528  Dear Secretary Chertoff  One of the most striking aspects of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina is that the majority of stranded victims were our society s most vulnerable members   low income families  the elderly  the homeless  the disabled  or non English speaking individuals   Many did not own cars   Many believed themselves unable to flee the city  unable to forego the income from missed work  unable to incur the expenses of travel  food  and lodging   Some may have misunderstood the severity of the warnings  if they heard the warnings at all   Some may have needed help that was unavailable   Whatever the reason  they were not evacuated and we have seen the horrific results  It appears that certain assumptions were made in planning and preparing for the worst case scenario in New Orleans   After all  most of those who could afford to evacuate managed to do so   They drove out of town and checked into hotels or stayed with friends and family   But what about the thousands of people left behind because they had special needs  Our charge as public servants is to worry about all of the people   We are troubled that our emergency response and disaster plans were apparently inadequate for large segments of the Gulf Coast population   We wonder whether the plans in other regions are similarly inadequate   Perfect evacuation planning is obviously impractical  but greater advance preparation can ensure that the most vulnerable are not simply forgotten or ignored  We urge you to develop a process by which all emergency planning efforts address the unique challenges of evacuating and or delivering emergency services to people with special needs   Questions that the Department needs to address include  Is there a transportation strategy for those without private vehicles  or funds for alternative private travel  Is there a temporary relocation strategy for those who cannot afford hotels or who have no nearby relatives with whom to reside  Are there adequate stockpiles of food  water  and medicine accessible to low income and special needs communities  or plans for immediate delivery  Do emergency professionals have the training and equipment required to assist people with mental or physical disabilities  Is there a strategy for ensuring that the millions of unauthorized immigrants in the country participate in evacuations free from fear of incarceration or deportation  Is there an adequate communication strategy for those without sufficient English or reading ability  or for the visually and hearing impaired  Communities with special needs may be more challenging to accommodate  but they are every bit as important to protect and serve in the event of an emergency   And though we cannot condone unauthorized immigration  we cannot have this population evading law enforcement during a crisis  We request that you provide information to us on the steps that the Department and its subsidiary agencies are taking to ensure that emergency planning at all levels is improved in this important way  Thank you for your attention to this matter  Sincerely  U S  Senator Barack Obama                                  ,Obama

Contact  Julian Green     Date  September 8  2005  Obama Introduces Bill to Create National Emergency Volunteer Corps   Washington   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced the Hurricane Katrina Emergency Workforce Act of 2005  which would create a national emergency health professional volunteer corps to ensure there is a ready pool of volunteer doctors and nurses who are willing  trained  and certified to serve in times of disaster  In a letter to President Bush  Obama also requested that the President take all necessary steps to expedite the process by which volunteer medical personnel can be deployed to areas damaged by Hurricane Katrina and areas where evacuees have been relocated    Although we live in a changing and uncertain world  one constant remains  whether it be earthquakes  hurricanes  tornadoes  or sadly even terrorist attacks  the nation will surely face future devastating and cataclysmic events   Obama said    We know now that the nation s preparedness for such events in no way matches our ability to respond and mitigate human suffering and economic collapse     Obama s bill would create a national emergency health professional volunteer corps so that there is a ready pool of volunteer doctors and nurses who are willing  trained  and certified to serve in times of disaster  In addition to creating this volunteer pool of professionals  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  would also be required to create a database of names and contact information of these volunteer health professionals so that they can be quickly called upon in a time of need  Lastly  the bill would provide liability protections to qualified health professionals and provide job protections to medical personnel who choose to volunteer to help in relief efforts     We have all watched TV reports of residents stranded  abandoned really  without food or water and medical care  while too many doctors who wanted to help were powerless to do so because they got caught in a web of bureaucratic red tape   Obama said   This bill will guarantee that America is never caught unprepared to help those who need it the most     Please find the full text of the letter below        September 8  2005     The Honorable George W  Bush  President  The White House  Washington  DC  20500     Dear President Bush      I am writing to ask you to take all necessary steps to expedite the process by which volunteer medical personnel can be deployed to areas damaged by Hurricane Katrina and areas where evacuees have been relocated      When I was in Houston earlier this week with former Presidents Bush and Clinton  I met countless hurricane evacuees with heart wrenching stories about the lack of medical care at the Superdome and New Orleans Convention Center   Although these people all expressed relief at the dramatically improved conditions at the Reliant Center  many were worried about the sick and elderly left behind at the makeshift hospital inside of the New Orleans airport   Many were also concerned about whether they would be able to receive adequate medical care while staying at temporary shelters in Houston      I understand that the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  has issued an urgent request for medical volunteers  including paramedics and mental health workers to respond to the needs of the sick  and morticians to respond to the recovery of those lives already lost in this disaster   And  an update published by the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  on Tuesday stated that Louisiana requires 100 mental health professionals for screening  counseling  and tracking of post traumatic stress disorders      The federal government should be doing everything possible to streamline the process by which trained medical personnel around the country can volunteer their services in Louisiana  Mississippi  Alabama  and any of the states where evacuees have been relocated   Indeed  I have heard from many medical personnel in Illinois who were eager to travel to these states to provide assistance       Unfortunately  my office has received numerous complaints from volunteer doctors that the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  did not return their phone calls  did not have information on how they could volunteer  or simply referred them to local authorities who were not able to help them   Doctors who attempted to volunteer their services on the HHS website encountered significant difficulties as well   Such a lack of information and responsiveness is shocking during a time of emergency       Given the urgent need to get medical personnel to affected areas as soon as possible  I am writing to request that you direct DHS  FEMA  HHS  and all other relevant agencies to work with the Red Cross and hospitals in affected areas to eliminate any bureaucratic obstacles preventing much needed services from getting to hurricane victims   This includes providing more detailed information to the medical profession about how they can volunteer their services  better coordination of volunteer doctors and nurses with the Red Cross and local hospitals  and waivers of liability for volunteer medical professionals       The health of too many people remains at risk  and bureaucratic red tape and run arounds should not prevent these people from getting the help they need      Sincerely      Barack Obama  United States Senator                                                 ,Obama

  Statement of Senator Barack Obama on the Continuing Crisis in Darfur   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                  Washington D C  Office SDB 40B Dirksen Senate Office Building   temporary location until April 19th                                                         Statement of Senator Barack Obama on the Continuing Crisis in Darfur Wednesday  April 23  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today released the following statement on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the continuing crisis in Darfur   All the proclamations  the  Never Again  speeches  and the efforts of many around the world have as yet failed to stop the five year long genocide in Darfur   The indiscriminate killing  raping and displacement continue and are escalating  Only decisive and concerted action can end this genocide    To start  the US must lead in supporting the full and effective deployment of the United Nations  UN  African Union  AU  protection force and ensure that the Government of Sudan faces meaningful penalties for obstructing and delaying the deployment of this force   Ambassador Williamson should be commended for his efforts to support the rapid deployment of the African Union United Nations operations in Darfur  UNAMID  peacekeepers   But the Administration  led by President Bush and Secretary Rice  must do more to ensure the UN has the necessary equipment    especially helicopter support    to ensure the full mobility and effectiveness of UNAMID troops  The US should also press for the unrestricted deployment of United Nations Mission in Sudan  UNMIS  forces in South Sudan to Abyei to help prevent the resumption of fighting in that fragile region where tensions are rising   I am deeply concerned by recent reports that the Bush Administration is negotiating the normalization of relations and lifting of sanctions against the Government of Sudan in exchange for piecemeal and modest action on a narrow set of issues   The approach contradicts the resolute and clear policy required to improve conditions on the ground for those at risk  Khartoum has a long history of breaking its commitments to its own people and to the international community   There should be no reward for bad faith   The US relationship with the Government of Sudan can only improve once conditions for the Sudanese people improve   I hope that this hearing will provide a clear explanation of how the Administration s current strategy adheres to this common sense principle     Those that continue to commit war crimes and obstruct peace and protection efforts must face significant penalties  The US should lead in the UN Security Council to impose effective targeted sanctions and to curtail violations of the arms embargo through the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee and the US Department of Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control   At the same time  the Administration should urge the AU to rebuke Khartoum for its role in the attempted coup in Chad  The US also needs to work with the International Criminal Court to ramp up the pace of indictments of those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity  while Khartoum must feel increased pressure to hand over those individuals already indicted by the Court    Lasting peace in Darfur and South Sudan can only be achieved through the unflagging commitment and cooperation of our government  other interested governments around the world  the UN  the AU  the Arab League  and the EU  among others  and advocacy groups  A more comprehensive  consistent  and robust diplomatic effort is an important part of the way forward   US leadership is urgently needed both to help construct a credible peace process for Darfur and to ensure the full and fair implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  The US must work to ensure that a single mediator  actively supported by countries with significant leverage  emerges from the confusion that has characterized the Darfur peace process to date  Prime Minister Gordon Brown s offer to kick start the process is helpful and should be explored   At the same time  Special Envoy Williamson should have sufficient staff and support to devote sustained attention to both the genocide in Darfur and the fraying North South peace process   I am heartened that citizen pressure and activism all over the US is having an impact  Divestment campaigns focused on schools  states  and mutual funds are gathering momentum   Well targeted advocacy related to China s role in Sudan can help promote a more constructive attitude in Beijing   Activists    particularly religious groups    are helping to put the issue of the North South peace deal back on the radar screen  And the anti genocide movement is growing by the day   It is long past time for the US to exert effective leadership to end the first genocide of the 21st century and work to ensure that it is the last                                  Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions

2007 Budget Monday  February  6  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green    Date  February 6  2006  Obama Statement on the 2007 Budget   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement about the proposed 2007 budget     Never before have Americans paid so much for a budget that does so little to keep them safe  secure  and prosperous in a 21st century economy   After years of shelling out billions in taxpayer dollars to well connected and well financed special interests  the President is facing a debt so large that he cannot afford the promises he s made to the American people     In the State of the Union  the President rightly praised our homeland defenders for their bravery  but gave us a budget that takes cops off the street and equipment from our firefighters   He called for us to stand united behind our troops  but his budget will cause 800 000 veterans to lose their health care   We heard about progress on crime and drugs  but see a budget with fewer resources to fight meth use at a time when local communities tell us it s the greatest threat to public safety   We heard about the need to make America more competitive in a 21st century economy  but now find out that thousands of students will be forced to give up college dreams as student aid is slashed for yet another year  And he talked about the importance of affordable health care  but he cut funding to provide health care to rural communities by 73 percent     The American people wanted to believe last Tuesday night that this President was ready to lead this country in a new direction  but they now see a budget that says more about this President s priorities than words ever can      In the months ahead  I look forward to working with members of both parties to end the special interest giveaways that have left us in debt so that we can finally keep the promise of a safer and more prosperous America     THE BUDGET BY THE NUMBERS  Unprecedented Fees on Military Retirees  The President is proposing an unprecedented increase in fees for military retirees using TRICARE  the military s managed care health program     By 2008  the President s plan would reportedly   Triple the TRICARE Prime enrollment fee for retired officers  from  230 to  750   Double enrollment fees for enlisted retirees  from  230 to  450   Double the deductibles for officers  from  150 to  300  and increase deductibles for enlisted members by 33 percent   150 to  200   Establish first ever enrollment fees for TRICARE Standard at  300 for officers and  200 for enlisted retirees  Increase TRICARE pharmacy co pays from  3 to  5 for generic drugs and from  9 to  15 for brand name drugs    Critics estimate that as many as 600 000 military retirees younger than 65 will drop out of TRICARE plans by 2015 because of the proposed fees    New Fees for Veterans Making More than  26 000  For the fourth year in a row  the President is proposing higher health fees and drug co payments for veterans  health care that would drive more than 213 000 veterans out of the VA system  The President would force veterans who do not have service connected disabilities and make more than an average of  25 842 to pay a new  250 annual enrollment fee for their medical care and would double their drug co payments from  8 to  15  for a 30 day supply    Continuing Ban on Middle Income Veterans with No Service Related Disabilities  The President  plan continues the ban on new Priority 8 enrollments  this includes veterans making more than  25 842 without a service related disability  Through this ban  the VA denied health care to 8 944 Illinois veterans last year  Nationally  more than 260 000 veterans were denied access to VA hospitals  clinics and medications last year  The VA s income cutoff varies by county  In Illinois  this averages  36 600 and ranges from a low of  27 350 in 36 rural and low income counties to  40 250 in the Chicago area  The 2005 national average for a single veteran was  25 842    Cuts Funding for Police Officers  The President s Budget cuts the Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  program by 80 percent   In 2005  COPS provided  7 4 million for hiring police officers in more than 60 Illinois Communities  Since 1994  the program has funded 5 854 police officers in Illinois with grants topping  416 million  Since 1994  Illinois has received more than  45 million in COPS grants to purchase crime fighting technologies   an average of  2 8 million per year in equipment that helps law enforcement save time  share information  and improve communications  The President s budget would completely eliminate funding for crime fighting technologies under the COPS program     Eliminate Funding to Fight Meth  The President would eliminate a critical source of assistance to police departments  the Byrne Memorial Grant Program  This year  more than 40 Illinois communities are splitting  12 9 million for Byrne Memorial Grants  Next year  they would receive nothing under the President s proposal  These grants help communities fight violent crime and provide assistance to victims of crime  Money provided by Byrne grants has been crucial in helping communities across Illinois join forces to combat this drug  In 2004 alone  Byrne grants helped Illinois cops make 1 267 methamphetamine related arrests and seize 348 923 grams of meth    Cuts Firefighters Assistance by 55 Percent  The President cuts funding for the Assistance for Firefighters Program by 55 percent from  629 million to  280 million  The program helps fire departments get critically needed equipment and training to protect the public  Illinois received 278 grants totaling  25 4 million for assistance to firefighters in 2005  If funding allocations remain the same next year  Illinois firefighters stand to lose  17 million from 2005   Freeze Need based Funding for College Students  The Bush budget freezes the maximum Pell grant at  4 050  for the fourth year in a row  despite rising tuition costs   In 1975  the Pell Grant covered 80 percent of the cost of a four year public college education   Today  that number is about 40 percent                                   ,Obama

  Kennedy  Specter  Obama  Senators Work to Overturn Supreme Court Decision on Pay Discrimination   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Kennedy  Specter  Obama  Senators Work to Overturn Supreme Court Decision on Pay Discrimination Friday  July 20  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt  No American Should be Denied Equal Pay for Equal Work      Led Better Decision Undermines American Principles WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Obama  D IL  joined a bipartisan group of fourteen Senators  led by Senators Kennedy and Specter  to introduce the Fair Pay Restoration Act  a bill to overturn the Supreme Court   s recent 5 4 decision in Ledbetter v  Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company  which undermined the basic protection against pay discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964   The decision also undermines pay discrimination claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act  The bill would restore the clear intent of Congress that workers must have a reasonable time to file a pay discrimination claim after they become victims of discriminatory compensation       I was deeply disappointed in the Supreme Court   s ruling in Ledbetter v  Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company     said Senator Obama      Contrary to Congress    intent and longstanding precedent  the conservative majority held that workers may not sue their employers for pay discrimination that originated years earlier     even if the unequal pay continues today   This strikes at the heart of equality in this country      Obama added      As Justice Ginsburg explained in her dissent  this ruling will make it extremely difficult to remedy gender and racial discrimination in the workplace under Title VII   Workers will often not discover that they have been discriminated against until years after the initial decision to issue unequal pay checks   At a time when women only earn 77 cents to every dollar that a man makes  we simply cannot let this decision stand   That is why I am pleased to join this bi partisan group of Senators to introduce common sense legislation to overturn this decision and make sure that all workers receive the guarantee of equal pay for equal work       The supporters of this bill believe that no American should be denied equal pay for equal work  Employees    ability to provide for their children  save for retirement  and enjoy the benefit of their labor should not be limited by discrimination  The Court   s decision undermined these bedrock principles by imposing unrealistically short time limits on such claims    The House Committee on Education and Labor recently passed the bill   s House counterpart  and the bill is ready for floor action in the House   The bill   s co sponsors are Senators Kennedy  D MA   Specter  R PA   Obama  D IL   Harkin  D IA   Snowe  R ME   Clinton  D NY   Mikulski  D MD   Durbin  D IL   Dodd  D CT   Leahy  D VT   McCaskill  D MO   Whitehouse  D RI   Boxer  D CA   Stabenow  D MI  and Murray  D WA    Below is a summary of the bill   The Fair Pay Restoration Act The Fair Pay Restoration Act would clarify that the laws against pay discrimination apply to every paycheck or other compensation a worker receives   The bill   s protection would extend to pay discrimination based on race  national origin  gender  religious  age or disability   The bill overturns Ledbetter v  Goodyear Tire   Rubber Co   a divided Supreme Court held that workers must sue for pay discrimination within 180 days after the original pay setting decision  no matter how long the unfair pay continues       Under the case  it doesn   t matter if the discrimination is still ongoing today  and the worker initially had no way of knowing that others were being paid more for the same work  So workers receiving an unfairly low wage today could still be out of time to hold the company accountable if they did not discover the discrimination soon after it first began  The Fair Pay Restoration Act will   Restores a fair  reasonable time limit for filing pay discrimination claims   The bill would start the clock for filing pay discrimination claims when compensation is received  rather than when the employer decides to discriminate  Each discriminatory paycheck would restart the clock for filing a pay discrimination claim   As long as workers file their claims within 180 days of a discriminatory paycheck  their charges will be considered timely   Retains a fair limit on the amount employers owe   Under the Kennedy bill  employers would not have to make up for salary differences that occurred decades ago  Current law limits back pay in job discrimination cases to two years before the worker filed a discrimination claim   The bill would not change this two year limit on back pay   Restores Congressional intent   The bill mirrors language prohibiting discriminatory

  Durbin  Obama  Costello and Shimkus Express Concerns Over Recent VA Promotion    U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Durbin  Obama  Costello and Shimkus Express Concerns Over Recent VA Promotion  Wednesday  July 23  2008  For Immediate Release   Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Michael Ortiz  Obama   Doctor who oversaw Marion VA facility chosen to oversee VA quality and safety WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  were joined by Congressmen Jerry Costello  D IL  and John Shimkus  R IL  in expressing concern over the recent appointment of Dr  Peter Almenoff   the former head of the regional network responsible for the Veterans Affairs  VA  Medical Center in Marion  Illinois   as the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health and for Quality Safety    In a letter to Secretary of the VA  Dr  James Peake  the members of the Illinois Congressional delegation asked for an explanation of the VA s decision to promote Dr  Almenoff along with a full description of his new responsibilities   Additionally  they asked for any information the VA may have about his efforts to ensure high quality medical care at Marion as director of the VA Heartland Network   Dr  Peter Almenoff had oversight authority over the Marion VA Medical Center when nine lives were lost due to substandard care   said Durbin    Just last week  he was given a promotion expanding his authority over healthcare throughout the VA   Critical questions about Dr  Almenoff s role in overseeing the quality of care at Marion VA should have been answered before he was appointed to this new position    After last year s unacceptable tragedies and negligent administration of the Marion VA  it s deeply troubling that Secretary Peake would promote the individual apparently responsible for the mismanagement of the facility to lead the Department s health quality and safety efforts   said Senator Obama    There are too many unanswered questions about Dr  Almenoff s role in the mismanagement of Marion that it seems imprudent to move forward with this appointment without further explanation  Our veterans and service members deserve care worthy of their sacrifice  and they should not be put in danger   I look forward to Secretary Peake s prompt explanation    We have repeatedly emphasized that the VA needs to be very clear with the public about how it is proceeding to restore confidence in the Marion VAMC and the overall veterans  health system   said Costello    Given Dr  Almenoff s previous position  we need more information as to how his promotion best serves the VA and our veterans moving forward    Many veterans have lost confidence in the Marion VA Medical Center  and their trust must be earned back   Shimkus said   Promoting someone at this time who had been in the chain of command  such as Dr  Almenoff  sends the wrong message to those who have put their lives on the line for this nation   Durbin  Obama  Costello and Shimkus have been closely monitoring the progress at the Marion VA Medical Center and the progress being made in hiring a new professional leadership team for the facility   Last month  in a meeting with the four Illinois lawmakers  Secretary Peake announced that a new leadership team will be put in place this fall at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Marion  Illinois      text of letter below and attached   July 23  2008   The Honorable James B  Peake  M D    Secretary of Veterans  Affairs  Department of Veterans  Affairs  810 Vermont Ave   NW  Washington  DC 20420 Dear Secretary Peake  Last week  the Department of Veterans  Affairs announced that its quality and safety efforts will be led by an official with a questionable track record of ensuring quality and safety at a VA medical care facility in Illinois   Dr  Peter Almenoff  who will serve as the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Quality and Safety  formerly directed the VA Heartland Network responsible for the Marion VA Medical Center   As you know  at least nine veterans died in 2007 because of surgical incompetence at the Marion facility   The VA reviewed the facility after the deaths and found easily identifiable problems at Marion   We are not aware of any efforts by the network to fix these problems in the months before the spike in mortality levels   Indeed  the Department s reviews identified certain deficiencies with the network led by Dr  Almenoff  The role of the network in the failure of the Marion facility was never formally reviewed   Nor were network officials included in the Administrative Board of Investigation review   Instead  the VA has promoted the director  who should have been aware of the mismanagement at Marion    mismanagement that led to the deaths of veterans who had every right to trust that they would receive quality medical care  It is difficult to understand the decision to promote Dr  Almenoff   News of his promotion will be frustrating for the veterans who rely on the Marion medical center  particularly since quality and safety issues were at the forefront of the facility s troubles   It may also be of concern to veterans nationally  as Dr  Almenoff presumably will be responsible for quality and safety issues for the entire VA   You have promised to visit Marion and meet with concerned individuals there  and we are sure you will be asked during your visit about the decision to promote Dr  Almenoff  We would appreciate an explanation for the decision to promote Dr  Almenoff and a full description of his new responsibilities  along with any information the VA may have about his efforts as director of the Heartland Network to ensure high quality medical care at Marion  Sincerely                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election      ,Obama

                                  CONTACT  Ashley Glacel  Kohl  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  Report Released in Advance of Tomorrow s House Energy   Commerce Hearing   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today joined with Senator Herb Kohl  D WI   Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging  and Senator Chuck Grassley  R IA   Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Finance  were joined by Rep  John D  Dingell  D MI   Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce  Rep  Joe Barton  R TX   Ranking Member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce  and other Senate and House colleagues in by the U S  Government Accountability Office  GAO  on the consumer protections states have in place for those who purchase long term care insurance  LTCI     Due to the rapid aging of America s population  the marketplace for long term care services is expected to expand significantly   Private LTCI has emerged as one possible way individuals can prepare for their long term care needs later in life   In their request to GAO  members of Congress expressed their interest in examining the frequency with which consumers are experiencing denial of benefits and exorbitant rate increases   In light of such practices  the GAO report examined the robustness of states  rate setting standards and the rules for settling of benefit denials  Congressional requesters expect to use the report findings as a guideline for determining the future viability of LTCI and to consider what  if any  regulatory steps could be taken on the federal level to strengthen consumer protections   Tomorrow at 10 00 a m  in 2123 Rayburn House Office Building  Rep  Bart Stupak  D MI   Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations  will hold a hearing entitled   Long Term Care Insurance  Are Consumers Protected for the Long Term    This hearing is the second in the subcommittee s series to explore issues of long term care service delivery and financing issues  GAO found that rate increases for LTCI policies fluctuate widely from state to state and plan to plan   For example  one company cited in the report repeatedly raised premiums  resulting in a cumulative increase of more than 70 percent since 1991  while another company has raised premiums only once since 1975   According to the report  rate stability standards  which are designed to protect consumers against sharp premium increases  have now been adopted by more than half of all states   However  because many states have not yet adopted these standards  a vast number of consumers are still left unprotected   Additionally  because the rate standards are so new  state regulators are unsure of how successful they will be in moderating future premium increases  GAO also reviewed claims settled by LTCI companies in ten states by evaluating consumer complaints   The report found that standards for the timely payment of consumer claims varied significantly by state  with  timely  being defined as five days in one state and 45 days in another   One state did not have a timeliness requirement at all   GAO also noted that some states are considering implementing an external appeals process for adjudicating disputed claims  The federal government expects that as many as 30 states will have Long Term Care Partnership programs in place by the end of this year   These programs encourage the private purchase of LTCI and feature state approved plans that combine private LTCI with possible add on Medicaid coverage in policies that allow consumers to protect some portion of their accumulated financial assets   Many state officials  as well as LTCI providers  are enthusiastically supporting rollout of these Partnership programs   As programs of this nature unfold across the country  the GAO report s findings make it clear that consumers who are urged by state governments to purchase these plans must have access to comprehensive  accurate information about Partnership approved plans to determine whether they are a sound and affordable choice for them  The report was requested jointly by the following   Senator Herb Kohl  D WI   Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging  Senator Chuck Grassley  R IA   Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Finance  Rep  John D  Dingell  D MI   Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce  Rep  Joe Barton  R TX   Ranking Member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging  Senator Byron Dorgan  D ND   Senator Amy Klobuchar  D MN   Senator Barack Obama  D IL     We need to make sure we get some of these already troubling issues resolved  especially since state governments are partnering with long term care insurance companies   said Senator Kohl    Congress is doing the right thing by taking a close look at long term care insurance to make sure consumers are protected    Affordable and comprehensive long term care is critical for the health  safety and independence of America s seniors   said Senator Obama    Many Americans are spending thousands of dollars on private long term care insurance  and yet when they need help the most  they often face lengthy waiting periods and wrongful denials of claims   We must take steps to strengthen oversight of this industry  ensure claims processes are consistent and fair  and guarantee that benefit packages offer the financial protection promised   I commend Chairman Kohl for his leadership on this important issue  and I look forward to working with my colleagues to address the findings of this report     The very high costs of long term care make it smart public policy to help people manage their financial risk with long term care insurance policies   It s also important to make sure these products are viable and don t leave consumers with big premiums and little security   This new report provides helpful information for federal and state lawmakers  regulators and consumer watchdogs in meeting that challenge   Senator Grassley said   The GAO s findings and our own Committee staff s investigation have identified troubling weaknesses in the states  ability to protect consumers from abusive practices   said Rep  Dingell    If the insurance industry is not up to the task of correcting these problems swiftly and treating vulnerable policyholders and their families fairly then Congress will need to consider steps to ensure strong  uniform national standards   Our oversight hearing tomorrow will lay the groundwork for urgently needed reforms in the industry and at the state and federal levels    As more and more Americans choose to purchase private long term care insurance to prepare for future needs  we must ensure that the product is fair and accessible   Companies  in partnership with government  should offer fair pricing  transparency in premium increases  and timely responses to complaints   I am proud that my state of New York was a pioneer in the Long Term Care Partnership program  and also holds some of the highest standards in the country for these types of consumer protections  As this GAO report makes clear  however  the federal government has a role to play  we need to take steps to ensure that seniors have the resources and information they need to make the right choices about long term care   said Senator Clinton   When planning for their long term care  people want the peace of mind that their insurance premiums won t be increased in dramatic and unpredictable ways  and that they ll have timely access to care   said Senator Dorgan    This type of basic stability for long term care will protect consumers and provide better healthcare access for those who need it    This report underscores the need for a new approach to long term care insurance to ensure that as the baby boom generation ages  standards will be in place to help people plan for their health care needs   said Senator Klobuchar    Long term care insurance will be critical to ensuring that our seniors have the care they need to live independently and stay in their own homes as long as possible    The GAO has identified significant gaps among the states in their abilities to protect consumers from abusive practices by their insurance companies   Rep  Stupak said    We look forward to hearing more tomorrow from GAO  other experts  state regulators and the industry itself about these issues  and to hearing their ideas for addressing the problems that policyholders face when they need to use the insurance they have struggled so hard to pay for     The GAO report can be found here                                   Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts

WASHINGTON  D C    A comprehensive plan to provide  3 96 billion in federal tax relief to flood  tornado and severe storm victims in the Midwest was introduced today by Senators Chuck Grassley and Tom Harkin of Iowa  Kit Bond and Claire McCaskill of Missouri  Norm Coleman and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  Dick Durbin and Barack Obama of Illinois  Pat Roberts and Sam Brownback of Kansas  and Evan Bayh and Richard Lugar of Indiana  The  Midwestern Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008  is modeled after tax legislation that Congress passed to help victims of Hurricanes Katrina  Rita and Wilma in 2005 and the tornado in Kiowa County  Kansas in 2007   Sponsors of the new legislation    S 3322    are urging Congress to act quickly   The same bill was introduced today in the House of Representatives by Representatives Dave Loebsack  Tom Latham  Bruce Braley  Steve King and Leonard Boswell of Iowa   Federal tax relief has proven to be very helpful to disaster recovery efforts in recent years   This summer  devastating natural disasters hit Iowa and other parts of the Midwest  so now it s time for Congress to pass tax relief legislation for the Midwest   I was Chairman of the Finance Committee after Hurricane Katrina   Lawmakers acted quickly for victims along the Gulf Coast   In 2005  a major individual tax relief package was signed by the President within three weeks of the Katrina disaster   A few weeks later  Congress followed up with an infrastructure and business tax relief package   Congress appropriated  60 billion in emergency funds within a week of the storm and much more followed   This year  we re seeking the same consideration for Midwestern disaster victims   Grassley said    After learning lessons from 9 11  Katrina and other disaster packages  we ve tailored this year s package to the needs of this major natural disaster    Iowans are picking up the pieces after enduring one of the most brutal floods in our state s history   Harkin said   After a disaster of this magnitude  Iowans deserve strong federal support  This tax relief will go a long way toward helping families  businesses and non profits recover and rebuild after the disaster     The recent floods  severe storms  and tornadoes have torn through the homes and lives of many Minnesotans and they need our help   Coleman said    This tax relief legislation provides victims of the Midwestern disasters with the support needed to recover and rebuild their communities  The best time to deliver this relief was yesterday  but the second best time is now and I will stand with my colleagues to ensure it becomes a reality for those who are still recuperating from the disasters    In Illinois  we still don t know the full extent of our losses   Durbin said    The damage is bad  but it could have been a lot worse had it not been for the hard work and determination of everyone who helped us prepare for the floods   I will bring a similar resolve to Washington as we work on approval of a tax relief package that will help people and communities across the Midwest get back on their feet after this major disaster    Families and communities across Illinois and the Midwest have lost so much as a result of this summer s flooding  and we must do everything we can to help them recover and rebuild as soon as possible   Obama said    I am proud to support this bill to offer tax relief and assistance to the victims of this disaster   I will continue to work with my colleagues to help rebuild the Midwest in the days and weeks ahead    From tornados this spring to the recent flooding on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers  Missourians have been hard hit by Mother Nature   The provisions in this bill will help disaster victims in my home state and across the Midwest rebuild   It is critical Congress acts now to provide the relief our families  businesses and communities need   Bond said   Throughout this epic event Missourians were able to come together and do what was necessary to prevent a tremendous amount of damage   And yet  the devastation is still overwhelming   Missourians will need all help from all possible angles to make sure we can rebuild America s heartland   McCaskill said   Our local communities in Minnesota showed incredible courage and resilience in rebuilding from this year s floods and storms    Klobuchar said   But at a time like this  local communities should not be expected to fend for themselves  The federal government has an essential role to support communities as they recover and rebuild    Disaster Tax Relief is a critical element of recovery as many Indiana communities embark on efforts to rebuild their homes and businesses   Lugar said   Thousands of residents in Indiana and across the Midwest have had their lives chaotically disrupted by storms  tornadoes and floods  We can and must do more to deliver critical aid to storm victims so they can rebuild their homes  their businesses and their lives   Bayh said  Individuals and businesses located in presidentially declared disaster areas due to floods  tornados and severe storms in Iowa  Arkansas  Illinois  Indiana  Kansas  Michigan  Minnesota  Missouri  Nebraska and Wisconsin would be eligible for the Midwestern Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008    Among other provisions  the legislation would let disaster victims with damage to their primary residence tap their assets and access cash by withdrawing money from retirement plans without tax penalties  suspend limits on tax incentives for charitable contributions  strengthening local and other fundraising drives collecting money to help small businesses and families recover  create tax credit bond authority to help local governments rebuild infrastructure  increase the amount of tax exempt bond authority to help businesses receive below market interest rate financing  remove limitations on deducting casualty losses due to natural disaster  and reduce the 2008 tax burden for small and mid sized businesses by substantially increasing the 2008 deductions for the depreciation and expensing of business property  Here s a summary of what s in the bill  RELIEF FOR ALL COUNTIES DECLARED ELIGIBLE FOR ASSISTANCE  The proposals immediately below benefit taxpayers located in all counties in the ten states mentioned above that are presidentially declared  FEMA  major disaster areas determined to warrant individual assistance  individual and public assistance  or public only assistance due to flooding  tornadoes  or severe storms   Qualified Disaster Recovery Assistance Distributions   The proposal waives the 10 percent penalty tax if a distribution from an individual retirement account   IRA   or tax favored retirement plan  e g   Code sections 401 k   403 b   or 457 b  plans  is considered a qualified Disaster Recovery Assistance distribution   qualified distribution     A distribution is considered a qualified distribution if it is made on or after the presidentially declared disaster date   applicable declaration date   and before January 1  2010 and is made to an individual whose principal residence on the applicable declaration date is located in a Midwestern disaster area and who sustained an economic loss by reason of the disaster   Other principal features include the following   i  the waiver is limited to amounts up to  100 000   ii  the mandatory withholding rules applicable to eligible rollover distributions would not apply   iii  participants receiving a qualified distribution would be permitted to spread the income tax resulting from receipt of the distribution ratably over three years  and  iv  amounts distributed may be re contributed to the plan over a three year period following the distribution and such re contributed amounts would not be includible in income in the tax year in which the distribution was made  e g   if a participant received a qualified distribution in 2008 and subsequently re contributed the distribution amount in 2009  the participant may file an amended return requesting a refund for the amount taxable in 2008   Recontribution of Withdrawals for Home Purchases   The proposal allows distributions for home purchases that were made from a Code section 401 k  or 403 b  plan or IRA after the date which is 6 months before the applicable declaration date and before the day after the applicable declaration date and that were not finalized because of the tornadoes and floods giving rise to the designation of the area as a disaster area to be re contributed to the plan or IRA tax free  i e   the recontributions would be treated as rollovers    Amounts must be re contributed within four months from the date of enactment of the bill in order to receive favorable tax treatment  Loans from Qualified Plans   The proposal effectively doubles the limitation on loans from a 401 k   403 b   or a governmental 457 b  plan by allowing participants located in a Midwestern disaster area and who sustained economic loss by reason of the tornadoes and floods giving rise to the designation of the area as a disaster area to receive loans up to the lesser of  100 000  or 100 percent of the vested accrued benefit for loans made after the date of enactment and before January 1  2010   In addition  outstanding loan payments due on or after the applicable declaration date and before January 1  2010 may be deferred an additional 12 months  with appropriate adjustments for interest  Suspension of Casualty Loss Limitations   Under present law  non business casualty losses are deductible by taxpayers who itemize only to the extent they exceed ten percent of adjusted gross income and a one hundred dollar floor  In some circumstances  taxpayers are permitted to include a current year casualty loss on an amended prior year return  The proposal eliminates the ten percent and one hundred dollar floor for casualty losses resulting from the Midwestern disaster and incurred in the disaster area  including those claimed on amended returns  Special Look Back Rule for EIC and Refundable Child Credit   To deal with the situation where 2008 records are lost or destroyed in a disaster  this proposal allows low income working families an election to use their 2007 income amount for purposes of determining their eligibility for the refundable earned income credit and the refundable child tax credit  Additional Personal Exemption for Housing Victims   Current law provides a personal exemption for taxpayers  their spouses  and dependents  The proposal allows taxpayers who house up to four dislocated persons from the Midwestern disaster for a minimum of sixty days in their principal residences an additional personal exemption of  500 per dislocated person  maximum additional personal exemption increase of  2 000    Family members  other than spouses and dependents  staying with the taxpayer may qualify  and the housing must be provided rent free  This proposal would not affect any deductions or exemptions for the dislocated person on the dislocated person s tax return   The deduction can be claimed in 2008 and 2009  but cannot be claimed in both years with respect to the same person  Exclusion for Certain Cancellations of Indebtedness   Under current law  gross income generally includes any amount realized from the discharge of indebtedness   The proposal ensures that individuals are not taxed on personal debt that is discharged in response to damage suffered from the Midwestern disaster   For example  if a house is damaged or destroyed and the mortgage lender discharges all or part of this mortgage debt  the amount discharged is not treated as income as a result of the proposal  Extension of Replacement Period for Property Lost Due to Floods or Tornadoes in the Midwestern Disaster Zone   Present law allows taxpayers not to recognize gain with respect to homes that are damaged or destroyed as a result of a presidentially declared disaster if the taxpayer replaces the property within a four year period  Business property that is destroyed must be replaced within a two year period to avoid gain recognition  The proposal extends the replacement period to five years for principal residences and business property that was damaged or destroyed within any presidentially declared disaster area for the Midwestern disaster   The extended replacement period applies to principal residences and business property  and the replacement property must be located in the Midwestern disaster area  RELIEF FOR ALL COUNTIES DECLARED ELIGIBLE FOR INDIVIDUAL ASSISTANCE OR INDIVIDUAL AND PUBLIC ASSISTANCE The proposals immediately below benefit individuals and businesses located in all counties in the ten states above presidentially declared  FEMA  major disaster areas determined to warrant individual assistance  or individual and public assistance  due to flooding  tornadoes  or severe storms  Relief for Individuals and Families Employee Retention Credit   This proposal provides a 40 percent tax credit for wages paid up to  6 000 if paid after the applicable disaster date  and before January 1  2009  by employers with 200 or fewer employees located in the Midwestern disaster area who continue to pay their employees while their business is inoperable   Representations Regarding Income Eligibility   Allows operators of qualified residential rental projects to rely on the representations of prospective tenants displaced by the Midwestern disaster for purposes of determining whether the individuals satisfy the income limitations for qualified rental projects  Individual s tenancy must begin during the six month period beginning on the date the individual was displaced by the Midwestern disaster  Expansion of Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning Credit   Current law allows a Hope Scholarship Credit in the first two years of post secondary education equal to 100  of the first  1 000 of qualified tuition and related expenses  and 50  of the next  1 000 for a maximum credit of  1 500  There is also a Lifetime Learning Credit available to students enrolled in one or more courses at the undergraduate or graduate level  whether or not pursuing a degree   equal to 20  of the first  10 000 in qualified tuition and related expenses  The proposal doubles the Hope Credit dollar amounts so the maximum credit would be  3 000  and doubles the Lifetime Learning Credit percentage from 20  to 40   for a maximum Lifetime Learning Credit of  4 000 for students attending undergraduate or graduate institutions in the Midwestern disaster area  Room  board  books and fees would also be considered qualified expenses   This proposal applies to tax years 2008 and 2009  Secretarial Authority to Adjust Taxpayer and Dependency Status for Taxpayers  The Midwestern disaster has displaced thousands of individuals   Under present law  a prolonged change in a family s living situation could affect its eligibility for various tax benefits   The proposal gives the Treasury Department the authority to ensure taxpayers do not lose deductions  credits or filing status because of dislocations from the Midwestern disaster  Mortgage Revenue Bonds   Mortgage revenue bonds are tax exempt bonds that state and local governments generally issue through housing finance agencies  The proceeds from the bonds are used to fund below market interest rate mortgages for certain first time homebuyers meeting income and purchase price restrictions  The proposal allows greater access to mortgage revenue bond proceeds by lifting the first time homeowner requirement through 2010 for homes in the area damaged by the Midwestern disaster   Additionally  special income and purchase rules for targeted area residences apply so that more individuals and residences may qualify for financing   It also allows up to  150 000 of the loan proceeds to be used for disaster related repairs to damaged homes  as opposed to  15 000 under current law   Tax Relief for Businesses Tax exempt Bonds   Provides Iowa  Arkansas  Illinois  Indiana  Kansas  Michigan  Minnesota  Missouri and Wisconsin the authority to issue a special class of qualified private activity bonds  called Midwestern disaster area bonds  outside of the state volume caps   The maximum aggregate bond authority with respect to any state cannot exceed  1 000 times the portion of the state population which is located in a Midwestern disaster area   Midwestern disaster area bonds can be issued by States and municipalities  Bond proceeds can be used to pay for acquisition  construction  and renovation of nonresidential real property  qualified low income residential rental housing  and public utility property  e g   gas  water  electric and telecommunication lines  located in the Midwestern disaster area  The current low income housing targeting rules are relaxed so that more bond proceeds can be used to rebuild housing in the Midwestern disaster area  Interest payments on the bonds are not subject to the AMT   The authority to issue Midwestern disaster area bonds expires after December 31  2010   In the case of project involving a private business use  either the person using the property suffered a loss in a trade or business attributable to severe storms  tornadoes or flooding or is a person designated by the Governor of the State as a person carrying on a trade or business replacing a trade or business with respect to which another person suffered such loss   In the case of a project relating to public utility property  the project must involve the repair or reconstruction of public utility property damaged by sever storms  tornados or flooding  Low Income Housing   Under current law  States receive allocations of low income housing tax credits based on population  The proposal allows States to allocate volumes of additional housing credit amounts in years 2009  2010  2011 of  18 per person in the Midwestern disaster area measured by population data issued before the earliest applicable disaster date for Midwestern disaster areas within the applicable state   Additional Depreciation   Permits businesses that suffered damage as a result of the Midwestern disasters to claim an additional first year depreciation deduction equal to 50 percent of the cost of new real and personal property investments made in the Midwestern disaster area  The additional deduction applies to purchased computer software  leasehold improvements  certain commercial and residential real estate expenditures and equipment  All depreciation deductions  including bonus depreciation  would be exempt from the AMT  The proposal applies to property placed in service through December 31  2011  December 31  2012 for real property   In addition  the Department of Treasury would be granted authority  on a case by case basis  to extend the bonus depreciation deadline for placing long lived property in service in certain circumstances for the Midwestern disaster area for up to one year  Expensing Property   Current law permits certain small businesses to deduct up to  250 000 of the cost of property used in the business  The proposal would increase this amount to  350 000 for qualifying expenditures made in the disaster area through December 31  2011  December 31  2012 for nonresidential real property and residential rental property   This proposal would also increase the level of investment at which benefits phase out from  350 000 to  1 4 million of qualifying purchases  thus allowing more businesses to use this tax benefit in rebuilding   This proposal applies to businesses that suffered property damage in the Midwestern disaster area and that placed property in service in the Midwestern disaster area after the date of the applicable disaster   Expensing Demolition and Clean up Costs   Under the proposal  50 percent of the costs  that would otherwise be capitalized  related to site cleanup and demolition would be deductible by businesses  Effective for amounts paid or incurred beginning on the applicable disaster date and ending on December 31  2010  Expensing Environmental Remediation Costs   The proposal extends the deductibility of costs of cleaning up a qualified contamination site  if the release  or threat of release  or disposal of a hazardous substance is attributable to the disaster described in the Presidential declaration in the Midwestern disaster area  Effective for expenditures paid or incurred beginning on the applicable disaster date and ending on January 1  2011   Increase in Rehabilitation Credit   For buildings that were damaged or destroyed in an applicable disaster  the rehabilitation credit is raised from 10 percent to 13 percent of qualified expenditures for any qualified rehabilitated building other than a certified historic structure  and the rehabilitation credit is raised from 20 percent to 26 percent of qualified expenditures for any certified historic structure  Five year Net Operating Loss Carryback for Certain Amounts   The proposal extends the net operating loss carryback period from 2 to 5 years for net operating losses attributable to  i  new investment and repairing existing investment in the areas damaged by the Midwestern disaster   ii  business casualty losses caused by the Midwestern disaster  and  iii  moving expenses and temporary housing expenses for employees working in areas damaged by the Midwestern disaster   The proposal is effective on the date of enactment  Tax Credit Bonds   Authorizes Midwestern disaster States to issue debt service tax credit bonds providing credits against Federal income tax instead of interest payments  so that these States can provide assistance to communities unable to meet their debt service requirements as a result of the flooding  tornadoes  and severe storms   The maturity of the bonds cannot exceed 2 years   At least 95 percent of bond proceeds must be used to redeem or to pay principal  interest or premiums on an outstanding bond  and such proceeds so used must be matched by an equal amount of State funds   The maximum amount of tax credit bonds shall not exceed  100 million for any state with an aggregate population located in the Midwestern disaster areas within such state of at least 2 million   50 million for states with such populations of at least 1 million but less than 2 million  and zero for any other state    Tax Incentives for Charitable Giving Temporary Suspension of Limitations on Charitable Contributions   The amount allowed as a charitable deduction in any taxable year may not exceed ten percent of the corporation s taxable income or fifty percent of an individual s adjusted gross income  The proposal temporarily waives these limits regarding charitable cash contributions dedicated to Midwestern disaster relief efforts   The proposal is effective for contributions paid during the period beginning on the earliest applicable disaster date for all States and ending on December 31  2008   Increase in Standard Mileage Rate for Charitable Use of Vehicles   The mileage rate individuals may use to compute a tax deduction for personal vehicle expenses associated with charitable work is statutory and has not been increased since 1997 and is currently at 14 cents per mile  For a taxpayer assisting in relief efforts related to the Midwestern disaster  the proposal sets the charitable mileage rate at approximately 35 cents per mile  which is seventy percent of the standard business mileage rate  beginning on the applicable disaster date and ending on December 31  2009  Exclusion from Income of Mileage Reimbursements for Charitable Volunteers   In general  reimbursements received for operating expenses of a personal vehicle used in connection with charitable work in excess of the statutory charitable mileage rate are taxable income to the recipient   However  reimbursements for charitable mileage attributable to the Midwestern disaster up to the amount of the standard business mileage rate will not be considered taxable income through December 31  2009  Enhanced Deduction for Donations of Food and Book Inventory   The proposal extends an enhanced deduction for donations of food inventory to all businesses through December 31  2009   Under present law  a taxpayer s deduction for charitable contributions of inventory generally is limited to the taxpayer s basis  typically cost  in the inventory   However  for contributions of food inventory  C corporations may claim an enhanced deduction equal to the lesser of  1  basis plus one half of the item s appreciated value  i e   basis plus one half of fair market value in excess of basis  or  2  two times basis   The proposal extends the enhanced deduction for donations of food inventory to non C corporation businesses   The proposal establishes an enhanced deduction for donations of book inventory through December 31  2009   Under present law  taxpayers may claim an enhanced deduction equal to the lesser of  1  basis plus one half of the item s appreciated value  i e   basis plus one half of fair market value in excess of basis  or  2  two times basis for donations of book inventory   The proposal extends the enhanced charitable deduction to donations of educational books to public schools  Tax benefits not available with respect to certain property   The proposals relating to additional first year depreciation  increased expensing  and the five year carryback of NOLs do not apply with respect to certain property   Specifically  as was done in the tax relief package for the Katrina disaster  the tax relief provisions do not apply with respect to any private or commercial golf course  country club  massage parlor  hot tub facility  suntan facility  or liquor store   The proposals also do not apply with respect to any property used directly in connection with gambling  animal racing  or the on site viewing of such racing  and with respect to buildings or portions of buildings dedicated to such activities  except if the portion so dedicated is less than 100 square feet                                   Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by

Illinois Senator Says Commitment Would Greatly Increase Consumer Access to E85     WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to Mr  H  Lee Scott  Jr   Chief Executive Officer of Wal Mart Stores  Inc   and to other top executives of hypermarket chains  which include major national and regional merchandisers  club stores  discount chains and national supermarket chains  asking them to commit to installing alternative fuel pumps at all store locations that sell gasoline    It is clear that alternative fuels are our energy future   Obama wrote   That market is up for grabs  and the resistance of conventional branded gasoline retailers to offering E 85 at their service stations creates an opportunity for companies like yours     It is estimated that the more than 3 600 hypermarket stores that sell gasoline will comprise up to 15  of national retail fuel sales within three years  Obama said that a commitment from these large companies to sell alternative fuels like E85  a blended fuel comprised of 85  ethanol and 15  gasoline  would greatly increase access to alternative fuels and help make America more energy independent      Given the large size of your company  a decision to offer this product at your retail fuel stations would contribute to building the infrastructure necessary to meet consumer demand and reduce dramatically our nation s reliance on foreign petroleum   Obama wrote   By announcing a new corporate policy to offer alternative fuels at all of your retail refueling stations  your company would demonstrate its commitment to investing in American made fuels and to protecting our nation s energy security and environment     E85 can be used in Flexible Fuel Vehicles  FFVs   which can also use unleaded fuel when E85 isn t available  Standard vehicles can burn fuel with a 10 percent ethanol mix  Ford Motor Co  Vice President Sue Cischke said last week that  We need about 30 times the   E85 ethanol pumps available today   to accommodate the more than 5 million flexible fuel vehicles currently on the road  It is estimated that only approximately 700 of the 165 000 publicly accessible gas stations sell E85    Stores that choose to install alternative fuel pumps would be eligible to receive a tax credit of up to  30 000 to offset the cost of installation  This tax credit was championed by Senator Obama and became law as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005    Obama s letter was sent to executives at  Wal Mart Stores  Inc   Safeway  Inc   Costco Wholesale Corporation  The Kroger Company  Meijer  Inc

the full text of Senator Obama s letter   May 22  2006   Dear Executive    The Energy Policy Act  signed into law by the President last year  calls for the production of greater levels of alternative fuels  such as ethanol and biodiesel  by the year 2012  and provides a tax credit for the installation of alternative fuel refueling pumps to expand consumer access to these new fuels    It is estimated that there are more than 3 600 hypermart supermarket gasoline sites in the United States  which could comprise up to 15  of national retail fuel sales within three years   Given that your company and similar mass retailers continue to expand into retail fuel markets  I urge you to commit to the installation of alternative fuel refueling pumps at each of your retail stations so that your customers will have full access to domestically produced  environmentally friendly alternative fuels  such as E 85  which is an 85  renewable ethanol 15  gasoline mixture   The nation is at a crossroads in energy policy   Our choice is to continue to cling to fossil fuels as the cornerstone of our supply  or to take advantage of existing technology and the emerging consumer preference for non petroleum based fuels     It is clear that alternative fuels are our energy future   That market is up for grabs  and the resistance of conventional branded gasoline retailers to offering E 85 at their service stations creates an opportunity for companies like yours     As production capacity of E 85 continues to rise and automakers increase production of flexible fuel vehicles  expanding consumer access to this new fuel is critical and prescient   Given the large size of your company  a decision to offer this product at your retail fuel stations would contribute to building the infrastructure necessary to meet consumer demand and reduce dramatically our nation s reliance on foreign petroleum   Moreover  by announcing a new corporate policy to offer alternative fuels at all

they are extremely concerned about the potential impact on Downstate Illinois communities if the plants are closed and asked Secretary Chao immediately prepare to assist displaced workers if closings occur    We ve seen how recent plant closings in Galesburg have devastated local economies and communities in Illinois   Obama said   The Department of Labor must be prepared to immediately help Maytag workers get back on their feet if the Herrin closing goes forward      Whirlpool s decision to close the Herrin  Illinois plant is a painful loss for Southern Illinois   said Durbin   We must

Secretary  United States Department of Labor  200 Constitution Avenue  NW  Washington  DC  20210   Dear Secretary Chao    We are writing regarding the decision of Whirlpool  Inc  to close Maytag washer and dryer plants in Illinois and Arkansas   These plant closings will have a significant impact on thousands of our constituents  and we request the immediate assistance of the Department of Labor  DOL  in helping displaced Maytag workers get back on their feet    As you know  Whirlpool announced on May 10 that it would be closing laundry appliance plants in Illinois  Arkansas  and Iowa   The Illinois facility is located in Herrin and employs 1 000 people  the Arkansas facility is located in Searcy and employs 700 people   These plants form the backbone of their respective communities  and the loss of these 1 700 jobs will be felt deeply by families across each of our states    We understand that state officials and community leaders are attempting to stop or mitigate these plant closings   However  we want to make sure that if the closings go forward  the 1 700 individuals in Illinois and Arkansas who will lose their jobs will have immediate access to the full range of DOL programs and services     Specifically  we request that the Department immediately mobilize resources through the DOL Rapid Response program to begin working with state and local workforce development agencies and local One Stop Career Centers to help Maytag employees transition into new jobs   These workers will require   career counseling and job search assistance  information about unemployment insurance  opportunities for education and training  and information about their health benefits and pensions options   We understand that Rapid Response specialists have a unique ability to provide this training  and we request that these specialists be mobilized immediately to help displaced Maytag workers    Further  we understand that Illinois and Arkansas may apply for Department of Labor National Emergency Grants to expand their capacity to respond to this crisis   We fully support and urge the Department s approval of any such application  as these layoffs significantly exceed the minimum criteria for National Emergency Grant assistance      Finally  we expect that many of our dislocated constituents will apply for Trade Adjustment Assistance   Competition from foreign imports may have played a central role in the loss of these 1 700 jobs   We hope the Department will consider certifying these displaced workers as eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance  which will help them return to suitable employment as quickly as possible    We appreciate your timely consideration of these requests   These plant closings will devastate our constituents in Herrin and Searcy  and 1 700 families are in urgent need of our government s assistance   We look forward to working with you to provide them with the help they require     Sincerely    Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   Senator

Senators led by Senators Barbara Boxer  D CA   Barack Obama  D IL   and Kit Bond  R MO  today expressed deep concern to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates about the state of mental health care services for soldiers at Ft  Carson  Colorado   In December  the Senators wrote to Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs William Winkenwerder after National Public Radio  NPR  aired a story detailing the failure of officials at Ft  Carson to provide adequate treatment for soldiers suffering from service connected mental health problems  including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD     And last week  the Senators  along with Senators Joseph Lieberman  I CT   Hillary Clinton  D NY   and John Kerry  D MA   dispatched their staff to Ft  Carson to meet with soldiers and commanding officers to investigate allegations of inadequate mental health care for troops       Our troops are risking their lives for this country  and the sad reality is they are not being given the mental health care services they need and deserve to stay healthy and strong     Senator Boxer said      This problem is not unique to Ft  Carson   clearly we need to be doing more across the board to improve mental health services for our Armed Forces  and to do that we need a strong commitment from the Secretary of Defense   The health and well being of our service members must be a priority for the Pentagon and for all Americans        A growing number of service members at Ft  Carson and throughout our military hospitals are returning from war with serious psychological injuries that must not go untreated  to say nothing of those who are going undiagnosed and falling between the cracks     said Senator Obama      We must implement comprehensive reforms that boost mental health resources and training at our military bases  reduce the strain on our troops and provide early detection  treatment and counseling for those who are affected   That s why I ve called for individual  face to face mental health screenings for all returning service members and for important new pre and post deployment screenings for traumatic brain injuries          When it comes to the poor treatment of some of our soldiers returning from combat  the revelations presented to my staff make Walter Reed look like a minor plot in a greater tragedy     said Senator Bond      The military   s handling of some soldiers suffering from mental health problems is unacceptable   We cannot allow the government to continue to fail these soldiers and their families who have sacrificed so much for this country          We have no greater moral obligation than to provide the best care to our soldiers     Senator Lieberman said      Many of them are facing mental health issues and we must provide them with timely and state of the art care  I was pleased by the commitment of the leadership at Ft  Carson to investigate any mishandling of service members    cases and I am committed to working with them and my Senate colleagues to ensure that our soldiers and military leadership have the resources they need to cope with the signature injuries of this war          We have a duty to our wounded warriors to reform and ready the military for the increasing number of veterans suffering from complex injuries like traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder     said Senator Clinton      After a recent Congressional staff delegation visit to Fort Carson  it is clear that much more remains to be done to improve access to mental health care for our wounded service members  to address the stigma that surrounds mental health issues  and to educate commanders on how to deal with soldiers suffering from these types of injuries          We must address all the wounds of war of our heroes when they return home     including the less visible ones  PTSD and traumatic brain injuries  I   m optimistic that this was a productive meeting   Major General Hammond and the leadership at the meeting listened intently to our concerns about access to mental health services for our soldiers     Senator Kerry said      This was an important step forward  and we feel strongly the military knows we mean business and they   ll work with Congress to make sure we are doing everything possible to support our soldiers and veterans  We urge the Secretary of Defense to listen and get our troops the care they need and deserve      The Senators today sent the following letter to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates asking him to ensure that Ft  Carson is given the resources and direction necessary to provide an optimal level of care for our service members    May 22  2007  The Honorable Robert Gates   Secretary of Defense   1000 Defense Pentagon   Washington  DC 20301  Dear Secretary Gates   In recent months  troubling allegations have surfaced at Ft  Carson  Colorado  suggesting that soldiers are not receiving adequate care for mental health problems incurred as a result of combat service in Iraq and Afghanistan   Specifically  soldiers have asserted that they are not receiving comprehensive treatment for Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI  and mental health issues  such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD    They have also alleged that the command climate discourages soldiers from seeking help for these problems   As a result  we dispatched members of our staff to Ft  Carson last week to investigate these claims   While Ft  Carson has taken some important steps to improve care for soldiers   including implementing mandatory TBI screening and enhancing the pre  and post deployment screening process  the reality remains that the base is facing significant challenges in providing mental health care services   The Department of Defense Mental Health Task Force recently found that the stigma of mental illness and injury is pervasive across our Armed Forces   and Ft  Carson is proving to be no exception   After meeting with soldiers as well as commanders at the base  our staff concluded that the stigma of mental illness is a significant barrier to care   They also determined there is a considerable lack of resources to adequately support the psychological needs of our service members and their families  and a lack of training and education regarding mental health problems for leaders from the division level to the unit level   These issues are severely impairing the ability of our Army and the Department of Defense to produce and maintain the best trained and equipped military fighting force in the world   While visiting the base  our staff received a commitment from Major General Jeffrey Hammond  Commander 4th Infantry Division  that he will investigate claims of command intimidation and lack of access to timely mental health services   They also received his commitment to train military personnel on the mental health challenges many of our service members face   While we are pleased at this commitment  it is apparent that the challenges at Ft  Carson cannot be solved by General Hammond alone   Therefore  we urge you to ensure that Ft  Carson and every other military installation facing similar problems are given the resources and direction necessary to provide an optimal level of care for our service members   We will be following up with a more detailed staff report on Ft  Carson in the near future  and we expect the Department of Defense to immediately review those findings and take appropriate action to see that any and all problems are corrected   Congress and the American people have made clear  especially following the revelations at Walter Reed Army Medical Center  that substandard care for injured service members will not be tolerated   These men and women have stood up for our country  and we have no greater obligation than to stand with them and their families in their hours of greatest need   Please respond as soon as possible to indicate your plans to address these issues   Sincerely   Senator Barbara Boxer   Senator Barack Obama   Senator Christopher Bond   Senator Joseph Lieberman   Senator Hillary Clinton   Senator John Kerry                                    ,Obama

23  2008  For Immediate Release   Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  Additional damage discovered after original request for assistance was denied WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today asked President Bush to declare fifteen southern Illinois counties federal disaster areas after severe flooding hit the area in March  The Illinois Senators were joined by Congressmen Jerry Costello  D IL   Tim Johnson  R IL  and John Shimkus  R IL  in their support of Governor Rod Blagojevich s appeal of the President s April 28 denial of a request for federal assistance for the following counties  Alexander  Franklin  Gallatin  Jackson  Jefferson  Johnson  Marion  Massac  Perry  Pulaski  Randolph  Saline  Union  White and Williamson   As a result of the denial of federal assistance  the Illinois Emergency Agency  IEMA  requested a second Preliminary Damage Assessment  PDA  which found additional damage to residences in four of the 15 counties that were included in Blagojevich s original request for Federal assistance   In all  the storm destroyed 64 homes and damaged more than 300 homes    Additional resources are badly needed in communities throughout Illinois that have been stretched to the limit in recent months   said Durbin    I am glad to join with my colleagues in Congress and in supporting Governor Blagojevich s request for federal funding that will allow these communities to fully recover from the storms    Illinoisans affected by the destructive flooding in March deserve federal relief to rebuild as quickly as possible   said Senator Obama   Fifteen counties in my home state endured significant damage  and we must ensure these families and businesses have the resources to recover   I strongly urge the President to reconsider his denial of federal assistance for those who are struggling to rebuild their lives    The federal disaster declaration was originally requested on April 8 as a result of severe flooding that began on March 17   The storm and floodwaters destroyed 39 homes and damaged more than 500 homes and 145 businesses   Further damage to roads  bridges  water control facilities and other public infrastructure have been reported although the full extent cannot be measured until the waters recede and local governments can conduct an initial assessment  If the state s request for federal assistance is approved  communities could apply for Individual Assistance and Hazard Mitigation Assistance   Individual Assistance includes aid to individuals and households which can include cash grants to help with temporary housing  home repairs and replacement  and other disaster related costs   Hazard Mitigation Assistance includes funding for measures designed to reduce future losses to public and private property    Hazard mitigation opportunities are assessed in most situations  Additionally  small business administration loans can be provided under an  SBA disaster assistance  declaration by the SBA Administrator even if the President denies the major disaster declaration and includes three types of loans to qualified homeowners and businesses   home disaster loans to homeowners and renters  business physical disaster loans to business owners and economic injury disaster loans to small businesses and small agricultural cooperatives   A federal disaster declaration includes SBA assistance under the Individual Assistance program at FEMA   text of letter below May 23  2008 The Honorable George W  Bush  The President  The White House  Washington  DC 20500 Dear Mr  President  We write to support Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich s request for a federal disaster declaration for fifteen counties in southern Illinois as a result of flooding beginning March 17  2008   Governor Blagojevich declared these counties state disaster areas on March 20  2008  Severe storms in late March produced extremely heavy rain and flooding in Alexander  Franklin  Gallatin  Jackson  Jefferson  Johnson  Marion  Massac  Perry  Pulaski  Randolph  Saline  Union  White  and Williamson Counties   As a result of the denial of federal assistance to aid residents in southern Illinois  it was necessary for the Illinois Emergency Agency  IEMA  to request a second Preliminary Damage Assessment  PDA   which was completed on May 21  2008  by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA    This PDA was able to verify the extent of damage to those homes that were inaccessible in April due to standing flood water in three counties since the initial PDA   According to the additional information from the second PDA  the storm s damage assessment has increased   In all  the storm destroyed 64 homes and damaged more than 300 homes  and it continues to present a disaster recovery situation that is beyond the capability of the State and affected local governments   Flood waters have also damaged roads  bridges  water control facilities  and other public infrastructure  which was discovered after the water receded  This is the fourth flood event for Illinois in the last year that has warranted federal disaster assistance   Constant flooding has exhausted the resources of many of the local governments affected by the most recent storms   We respectfully request that you make the necessary declaration so that the residents of these fifteen counties can receive federal disaster assistance   The flooded area in the fifteen counties has a population that is 45 percent low income  and federal assistance through the programs administered by FEMA will help them to recover from this devastating flood   We thank you in advance for your timely consideration of this important request and stand ready to assist in any way appropriate  Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin        United States Senator                                                                      Barack Obama  United States Senator

First Assess and Address Minority Media Ownership WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to Federal Communications Commission  FCC  Chairman Kevin J  Martin  calling on him to launch an independent review panel to develop proposals to further promote media ownership diversity   According to press accounts  following an insufficient 30 day review  the FCC intends to modify existing ownership rules by allowing greater media market consolidation   This would allow large media outlets to become larger  potentially cutting out small business  women and minority owned firms   Minority owned and operated newspapers and radio stations play an important role in the African American and Latino communities and help bring minority issues to the forefront of our national dialogue   However  the Commission has failed to recognize the vital role these outlets play in our democracy and has not done enough to further the goals of diversity in the media  In the letter  Obama also asks for the FCC to reconsider the Chairman   s proposed consolidation timeline and start a public review of any specific proposed rule modifications   He also asks Martin to complete a study of the responsibilities that broadcasters have to the communities in which they operate   Obama and Senator John Kerry have previously written to Kevin Martin asking him to address the issue of minority media ownership  and the impact that new rules would have on opportunities for minority  small business  and women owned firms   The text of the letter is below  Dear Chairman Martin    I am writing regarding your proposal to move forward aggressively with modifications to existing media ownership rules   According to press accounts  you intend to present specific changes to existing rules in November with a Commission vote on that proposal     whatever it may be     on December 18  2007   I believe both the proposed timeline and process are irresponsible    Minority owned and operated newspapers and radio stations play a critical role in the African American and Latino communities and bring minority issues to the forefront of our national discussion   However  the Commission has failed to further the goals of diversity in the media and promote localism  and as a result  it is in no position to justify allowing for increased consolidation of the market   Moreover  30 days of public review of a specific proposed change is insufficient to assess the effect that change would have on the media marketplace or the rationale on which any such proposal is based   While the FCC did commission two studies on minority ownership in the round of 10 studies it ordered at the beginning of 2007  both suffered from the same problem     inadequate data from which to make determinations on the status of minority media ownership or the causes for that status and ways to increase representation    It is time to put together an independent panel  as Commissioner Adelstein has recommended  to issue a specific proposal for furthering the goal of diversity in media ownership   I object to the agency moving forward to allow greater consolidation in the media market without first fully understanding how that would limit opportunities for minority  small business  and women owned firms  I also object to the Commission   s propensity to vet proposals through leaks to the press and lobbyists   The Government Accountability Office  GAO  issued a report in September 2007 titled     The FCC Should Take Steps to Ensure Equal Access to Rulemaking Information      In that report  GAO found that      Situations where some  but not all  stakeholders know what the FCC is considering for an upcoming vote undermine fairness and transparency of the process and constitute a violation of the FCC   s rules      The report went on to state      This imbalance of information is not the intended result of the Communications Act and it runs contrary to the principles of transparency and equal opportunity for participation established by law and to the FCC   s own rules that govern rulemaking     In the wake of that report  I find it disturbing that  according to the New York Times  the Commission is considering repealing the newspaper and television cross ownership rules   It is unclear what your intent is on the rest of the media ownership regulations   Repealing the cross ownership rules and retaining the rest of our existing regulations is not a proposal that has been put out for public comment  the proper process for vetting it is not in closed door meetings with lobbyists or in selective leaks to the New York Times    Although such a proposal may pass the muster of a federal court  Congress and the public have the right to review any specific proposal and decide whether or not it constitutes sound policy   And the Commission has the responsibility to defend any new proposal in public discourse and debate    This is not the first time I have communicated with the agency on this matter   Senator Kerry and I wrote to you on July 20  2006  stating that the Commission needed to address and complete a proceeding on issues of minority and small business media ownership before taking up the wider media ownership rules   Our request echoed an amendment adopted by the Senate Commerce Committee in June 2006   And last month  at an FCC hearing on media ownership held in Chicago  I requested that the FCC put out any specific changes that would be voted on in a new notice of proposed rulemaking so that the American people have an opportunity to review it    In closing  I ask you to reconsider your proposed timeline  put out any specific change to the rules for public comment and review  move to establish an independent panel on minority and small business media ownership  and complete a proceeding on the responsibilities that broadcasters have to the communities in which they operate

     Obama  Coburn to Introduce Hurricane Katrina Oversight Legislation Wednesday  September 14  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Coburn Contact  John Hart or Aaron Cooper   202  228 5357  Date  September 14  2005 Obama  Coburn to Introduce Hurricane Katrina Oversight Legislation   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  today introduced the Oversight of Vital Emergency Recovery Spending Enhancement and Enforcement Act  OVERSEE   which is designed to ensure financial integrity in the Hurricane Katrina relief and recovery effort    Last week  Congress approved  62 billion for Gulf Coast relief and rebuilding efforts   most of which will go directly to FEMA   said Obama   This is twelve times the amount of money FEMA was given last year   more than it has ever been trusted to spend before  If FEMA s track record during the rescue effort and in years before is any indication of how they will perform during the rebuilding that lies ahead  this should concern every taxpayer and every citizen interested in helping the millions of Americans who have been devastated by Hurricane Katrina     Previous rebuilding efforts involving FEMA and other government agencies have a history of fraud  corruption  and waste when there is no oversight or accountability in how the funds are spent  Following Hurricane Frances in 2004  FEMA awarded  30 million and approved more than 12 000 claims for residents of Miami Dade County  The storm  however  made landfall 100 miles north and Miami Dade never even saw hurricane force winds    The Coburn Obama bill would create a Chief Financial Officer  CFO  to oversee all expenditures associated with the Hurricane Katrina relief and reconstruction effort  The Hurricane Katrina CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  staffed with experts from relevant federal agencies  and would have management and oversight over any agency using federal funds for the recovery  The CFO would issue monthly financial reports to Congress and the Government Accountability Office would issue quarterly reports to Congress reviewing the work of the CFO and recovery activities    As we look towards the massive Gulf Coast rebuilding efforts ahead  we must demand accountability over how the billions of dollars we ve given to FEMA are spent   said Obama   The CFO will also specifically look at whether federal funds are going to people most in need  whether federal funds are going to companies that hire local workers  and the extent to which the federal government is using no bid and  cost plus  contracts  As you ll recall  these contracts are what caused the whole contracting mess in Iraq      Even if the Levees hadn t burst and New Orleans didn t flood  Hurricane Katrina would still be the largest natural disaster this country has ever faced  and the rebuilding effort will be certainly be the largest and costliest of its kind  This entrusts FEMA with a massive amount of responsibility  and so it s only right that we protect both taxpayers and citizens on the Gulf Coast with strict accountability and oversight about how the money is being spent and whether it s being most efficiently directed to helping people rebuild their lives    SUMMARY OF COBURN OBAMA  OVERSEE ACT  A Chief Financial Officer  CFO  would be established and would be responsible for the efficient and effective use of federal funds in all activities relating to the recovery from Hurricane Katrina  Unlike an IG which audits money after it has been spent  the CFO would review expenditures before they are approved  This is a better way to protect against waste  fraud  and abuse  The CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  and located in the Executive Office of the President  The CFO office would be staffed with experts detailed from relevant federal agencies  would have management and oversight of each federal agency involved in the recovery effort  and would work in conjunction with the inspectors general in each of these agencies   Every month  the CFO would issue financial reports to Congress on the use of federal funds  These reports would include information about the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to persons most in need  the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to companies that hire local workers  and the use of sole source and  cost plus  contracts  The Government Accountability Office  GAO  would issue quarterly reports reviewing the activities and expenses approved by the CFO  These reports would examine the accuracy of the CFO s reports and include information on the extent of waste  fraud  and abuse in federal spending  the use of sole source or  cost plus  contracts  whether federal funds have been used appropriately by state and local agencies  and the extent to which federal funds have helped persons most in need and local workers  The CFO position would terminate one year after the enactment of the bill but could be extended for an additional year by the President                                    ,Obama

24  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 24  2008  CONTACT  Liz Richardson  Kerry  or Michael Ortiz  Obama     WASHINGTON  DC   Senators John Kerry and Barack Obama sent a letter to the Chairman and Ranking member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  Sen  Carl Levin and Norm Coleman respectively  Kerry and Obama asked that their colleagues consider investigating government contractors that circumvent paying payroll taxes by hiring employees through offshore shell companies  Last month  Kerry and Obama introduced the Fair Share Act of 2008 to close this tax loophole and save the American taxpayer an estimated  846 million over ten years  In the House  the bill is being sponsored by Reps  Brad Ellsworth and Rahm Emanuel  and was recently included in the Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act of 2008      Abusing offshore tax loopholes is wrong and at least one greedy company has fleeced the American taxpayer to the tune of hundreds of millions since the Iraq war began   said Senator Kerry   The American people who play by the rules and foot the bill for this war in Iraq deserve to know just how many companies are avoiding paying their fair share of taxes and how much it s costing our economy  The Senate has a responsibility to shed some sunlight on the tax practices of these government contractors  and we will not be satisfied until these kinds of loopholes are eliminated once and for all      It s the responsibility of American companies to pay their taxes and ensure that their employees  work is counted for future Social Security and Medicare benefits   said Senator Obama   It s unacceptable for contractors to use foreign shell companies to avoid paying their share of payroll taxes  and that s why Senator Kerry and I introduced legislation to close this loophole and hold these contractors accountable   I look forward to moving this legislation forward and working to crack down on tax havens and abusive tax shelters     Please find the text of Senator Kerry and Obama s letter below  April 23  2008 The Honorable Carl Levin    Chairman   Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations   Committee on Homeland Security   Governmental Affairs    199 Russell Senate Office Building      The Honorable Norm Coleman  Ranking Member  Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  Committee on Homeland Security   Governmental Affairs    199 Russell Senate Office Building      Dear Senators Levin and Coleman  Recently  we introduced S  2775  the Fair Share Act of 2008  which ends the practice of U S  government contractors setting up shell companies in foreign jurisdictions to avoid payroll taxes   Representatives Ellsworth and Emanuel also introduced companion legislation  This legislation amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Social Security Act to treat foreign subsidiaries of U S  companies performing services under contract with the United States government as American employers for the purpose of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes  The legislation was introduced in response to a Boston Globe article in which Farah Stockman reported that Kellogg Brown   Root  KBR  has avoided payroll taxes by hiring workers through shell companies in the Cayman Islands   American companies who are benefiting from U S  government contracts are able to set up foreign subsidiaries in tax havens and treat American workers employed in connection with the contract as employees of the subsidiary   As a result  those employers can avoid Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes and their employees are denied the contributions for Federal benefits purposes  We bring this issue to your attention because we think it is another example of the abuse of offshore tax havens used in order to avoid the payment of U S  taxes   We believe closing this glaring loophole is consistent with your efforts to address tax shelters and tax havens   It is unclear how pervasive the practice used by KBR is  but there are numerous federal contractors that have subsidiaries located in tax havens and  as your investigations have uncovered  an abundance of tax professionals willing to help companies shirk their tax responsibilities whenever a loophole can be found      We are working with the Finance Committee to close this tax loophole  and the House recently included this legislation as part of the Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act of 2008   The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that closing this loophole raises  846 million over ten years    We request that the Permanent Subcommittees on Investigations investigate this and similar abuses by federal contractors to avoid payroll taxes  and we look forward to continuing to work with you on measures to ensure fairness for American taxpayers    Sincerely

Senate  241 Russell Senate Office Building  Washington  DC  20510   Dear John    Thank you for inviting me to participate in the meeting yesterday to discuss lobbying and ethics reform proposals currently before the Senate   I appreciate your willingness to reach out to me and several other Senate Democrats to discuss what should be done to restore public confidence in the way that Congress conducts its business   The discussion clearly underscored the difficult challenge facing Congress    You and many in the Democratic Caucus have played a major role in reform efforts in the Senate   In fact  the Indian Affairs Committee hearings you led were instrumental in promoting public awareness of the culture of corruption that has permeated the nation s capital    As you know  Senator Harry Reid and others in the Democratic Caucus have taken an important step by introducing   which imposes many of the same disclosure requirements for lobbyists that you have proposed  while also strengthening enforcement  eliminating  pay to play  schemes  and imposing more restrictive rules on meals  gifts  and travel that Members and their staff can receive from special interests that advocate before Congress   This bill  which now has the support of 40 members of the Democratic Caucus  represents a significant step in addressing many of the worst aspects of corruption that have come to light as a result of the Justice Department investigation of Jack Abramoff    I know you have expressed an interest in creating a task force to further study and discuss these matters  but I and others in the Democratic Caucus believe the more effective and timely course is to allow the committees of jurisdiction to roll up their sleeves and get to work on writing ethics and lobbying reform legislation that a majority of the Senate can support   Committee consideration of these matters through the normal course will ensure that these issues are discussed in a public forum and that those within Congress  as well as those on the outside  can express their views  ensuring a thorough review of this matter    Given the state of affairs in Washington  we have a historic opportunity to make fundamental changes in the way our government operates so that the actions we take as public officials are responsive and transparent to the American people   Thank you again for your interest in this important matter    Sincerely     Barack Obama  United States Senator  February 6  2006   The Honorable Barack Obama  United States Senate  SH 713  Washington  DC 20510   Dear Senator Obama  I would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me regarding your desire to cooperate in our efforts to negotiate bipartisan lobbying reform legislation were sincere   When you approached me and insisted that despite your leadership s preference to use the issue to gain a political advantage in the 2006 elections  you were personally committed to achieving a result that would reflect credit on the entire Senate and offer the country a better example of political leadership  I concluded your professed concern for the institution and the public interest was genuine and admirable   Thank you for disabusing me of such notions with your letter to me dated February 2  2006  which explained your decision to withdraw from our bipartisan discussions   I m embarrassed to admit that after all these years in politics I failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self interested partisan posturing appear more noble   Again  sorry for the confusion  but please be assured I won t make the same mistake again    As you know  the Majority Leader has asked Chairman Collins to hold hearings and mark up a bill for floor consideration in early March   I fully support such timely action and I am confident that  together with Senator Lieberman  the Committee on Governmental Affairs will report out a meaningful  bipartisan bill       You commented in your letter about my  interest in creating a task force to further study  this issue  as if to suggest I support delaying the consideration of much needed reforms rather than allowing the committees of jurisdiction to hold hearings on the matter   Nothing could be further from the truth   The timely findings of a bipartisan working group could be very helpful to the committee in formulating legislation that will be reported to the full Senate   Since you are new to the Senate  you may not be aware of the fact that I have always supported fully the regular committee and legislative process in the Senate  and routinely urge Committee Chairmen to hold hearings on important issues   In fact  I urged Senator Collins to schedule a hearing upon the Senate s return in January    Furthermore  I have consistently maintained that any lobbying reform proposal be bipartisan   The bill Senators Joe Lieberman and Bill Nelson and I have introduced is evidence of that commitment as is my insistence that members of both parties be included in meetings to develop the legislation that will ultimately be considered on the Senate floor   As I explained in a recent letter to Senator Reid  and have publicly said many times  the American people do not see this as just a Republican problem or just a Democratic problem   They see it as yet another run of the mill Washington scandal  and they expect it will generate just another round of partisan gamesmanship and posturing   Senator Lieberman and I  and many other members of this body  hope to exceed the public s low expectations   We view this as an opportunity to bring transparency and accountability to the Congress  and  most importantly  to show the public that both parties will work together to address our failings     As I noted  I initially believed you shared that goal   But I understand how important the opportunity to lead your party s effort to exploit this issue must seem to a freshman Senator  and I hold no hard feelings over your earlier disingenuousness   Again  I have been around long enough to appreciate that in politics the public interest isn t always a priority for every one of us   Good luck to you  Senator    Sincerely    John McCain  United States Senate    February 6  2006   The Honorable John McCain  United States Senate  241 Russell Senate Office Building  Washington  DC  20510   Dear John    During my short time in the U S  Senate  one of the aspects about this institution that I have come to value most is the collegiality and the willingness to put aside partisan differences to work on issues that help the American people   It was in this spirit that I approached you to work on ethics reform  and it was in this spirit that I agreed to attend your bipartisan meeting last week   I appreciated then   and still do appreciate   your willingness to reach out to me and several other Democrats    For this reason  I am puzzled by your response to my recent letter   Last Wednesday morning  you called to invite me to your meeting that afternoon   I changed my schedule so I could attend the meeting   Afterwards  you thanked me several times for attending the meeting  and we left pledging to work together    As you will recall  I told everyone present at the meeting that my caucus insisted that the consideration of any ethics reform proposal go through the regular committee process   You didn t indicate any opposition to this position at the time  and I wrote the letter to reiterate this point  as well as the fact that I thought     I confess that I have no idea what has prompted your response   But let me assure you that I am not interested in typical partisan rhetoric or posturing   The fact that you have now questioned my sincerity and my desire to put aside politics for the public interest is regrettable but does not in any way diminish my deep respect for you nor my willingness to find a bipartisan solution to this problem       Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator                                Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election      ,Obama

enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug  Improvement  and Modernization Act of 2003  U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Ken Salazar  D CO  sent a letter to Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  Secretary Michael O  Leavitt requesting that the Department outline the steps it has taken to correct misinformation it distributed  improve its ability to respond to and answer seniors  questions  and prevent fraud    Given the enormous health and financial implications  Americans have every right to expect that the benefit plan will be implemented in an efficient  comprehensible and fair manner   Obama and Salazar said   Two years after the enactment of this bill  we are deeply troubled by recent newspaper reports and complaints we have received from constituents that highlight flaws in the implementation of the Medicare drug benefit     In their letter  Obama and Salazar said they were troubled by reports that the 2006 Medicare   You handbook mailed to 42 million beneficiaries contained significant errors regarding the monthly premiums that plans will charge low income enrollees  The Senators asked Secretary Leavitt to outline actions HHS has taken to correct this and other misinformation  as well as explain steps it has taken improve its ability to respond to and answer questions and protect seniors from fraud  They requested a response by January 3  2006    We were not members of Congress in 2003 when the Medicare Modernization Act was enacted   Obama and Salazar said   We therefore have no political stake in defending or criticizing the merits of the law that created the prescription drug benefit  As public servants  however  we have every interest in ensuring that seniors and people with disabilities receive reliable  accurate information  that the federal government prohibits insurers and agents from victimizing seniors in the marketing of the plans  that seniors and people with disabilities get the assistance necessary to make informed choices  and that the prescription benefit is properly implemented     Below  please find the full text of the letter                                                      December 8  2005   The Honorable Michael O  Leavitt  Secretary  Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C   20201    Dear Secretary Leavitt     As you know  during the next few weeks  millions of America s seniors and people with disabilities face the difficult task of selecting a Medicare prescription drug plan   As you also know  we were not members of Congress in 2003 when the Medicare Modernization Act  MMA  was enacted   We therefore have no political stake in defending or criticizing the merits of the law that created the prescription drug benefit   As public servants  however  we have every interest in ensuring that seniors and people with disabilities receive reliable  accurate information  that the federal government prohibits insurers and agents from victimizing seniors in the marketing of the plans  that seniors and people with disabilities get the assistance necessary to make informed choices  and that the prescription benefit is properly implemented     Given the enormous health and financial implications  Americans have every right to expect that the benefit plan will be implemented in an efficient  comprehensible and fair manner   Two years after the enactment of the MMA  we are deeply troubled by recent newspaper reports and complaints we have received from constituents that highlight flaws in the implementation of the Medicare drug benefit     For example  misinformation provided by your Department has caused significant confusion   The 2006 Medicare   You handbook mailed to 42 million beneficiaries contained significant errors regarding the monthly premiums that plans will charge low income enrollees   The informational insert published in Parade magazine misrepresented the Medicare drug benefit as more generous than it really is   Moreover  when beneficiaries call 1 800 MEDICARE  the primary source for information regarding the drug benefit  they often encounter automated messages requesting that they call back   Many beneficiaries complain that when they are connected to a live person  the operators are unable to answer all but the most basic questions regarding the benefit plans   Given the lack of accurate information available to beneficiaries  it is no surprise that a recent poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the majority of seniors do not understand the Medicare drug benefit       Recent newspaper reports also reveal that seniors may be at risk of being defrauded by unscrupulous insurers and agents who reportedly have visited their residences uninvited  pressured them to select particular plans  misrepresented plans  and requested personal information such as Social Security numbers and banking information   Although it is impossible to completely prevent fraudulent activities by unscrupulous persons  it does not appear that state and federal authorities have a coordinated plan of action to deter fraudulent conduct and to swiftly prosecute insurers and agents who engage in illegal activities   Implementation of the new drug benefit should not be an open invitation for scam artists to take advantage of senior citizens        In light of these reports  we strongly urge you to take immediate action to address these concerns  and request that you provide our offices with answers to the following questions as soon as possible   What actions has your Department taken to correct the misinformation provided to beneficiaries   Does your Department have a way to determine whether the corrected information is reaching beneficiaries Is there an adequate communications strategy for interacting with individuals with disabilities or for those without sufficient English or reading abilities Are the 1 800 MEDICARE informational centers properly staffed to respond to the inquiries What actions has your Department taken to ensure that operators who staff the 1 800 MEDICARE information centers are properly trained to meaningfully respond to questions concerning the benefit plans  Is there a coordinated plan between federal and state authorities to investigate and prosecute insurers  agents and others who engage in fraudulent and otherwise illegal conduct in marketing and selling the benefit plans   If so  what is the plan What actions has the Department implemented to deter fraudulent conduct in the marketing of the plans  including monitoring the conduct of authorized plan insurers      We request that you provide this information to us by January 3  2006      We owe Medicare beneficiaries clarity  fairness  and our best efforts to implement the benefit plan   Similarly  we owe our Americans assurances that their tax dollars are spent wisely and efficiently   We look forward to reviewing your response  and to overseeing effective  timely interventions to address the shortcomings of the implementation effort to date          Sincerely

in funding for judicial security that Durbin and Obama had appropriated in this past year s emergency supplemental appropriation legislation  The funding will be used for installation of security

husband and mother of Judge Joan Lefkow of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois  we met with the Director of the U S  Marshal Service and worked to provide the money

for the federal court system led by then Chief Justice Rehnquist  The Judicial Conference requested that the  12 million to improve security for federal judges be included in this year s Supplemental

  Obama Joins Kennedy  Lewis to Introduce Civil Rights Act of 2008   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama Joins Kennedy  Lewis to Introduce Civil Rights Act of 2008 Thursday  January 24  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                            CONTACT  Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  WASHINGTON  DC   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Congressman John Lewis  along with more than a dozen Senate colleagues  introduced the Civil Rights Act of 2008  which will strengthen accountability when civil rights and workers  rights are violated   Recent court decisions have weakened America s civil rights laws in ways that Congress never intended   This legislation will ensure accountability for violations of our civil rights and fair labor laws and give individuals the right to challenge practices that have unjustified discriminatory effect based on race  color  national origin  disability  age or gender  It also gives students the same protection from harassment in school that workers have on the job  and holds employers fully accountable for age discrimination and discrimination against our men and women in the armed services   The Civil Rights Act of 2008 is co sponsored by Senators Leahy  Dodd  Lautenberg  Bingaman  Kerry  Harkin  Mikulski  Akaka  Boxer  Feingold  Murray  Durbin  Schumer  Cantwell  Clinton  Obama  Menendez  Cardin  and Brown   Senator Kennedy said   Civil rights is still the unfinished business of America   Prejudice  discrimination  and outright bigotry continue to limit the lives of large numbers of our people  and even some courts have rolled back core protections for civil rights and workers  rights  The Civil Rights Act of 2008 will restore the bedrock principle that individuals may challenge all forms of discrimination in public services and will strengthen existing civil rights protections   Our civil rights and fair labor laws must have effective remedies that ensure accountability for discrimination  or America will never be America    The struggle for civil rights in this country   said Rep  John Lewis   has been a long hard road  littered with the broken bodies of countless men and women who gave all they had for the cause of social justice    They were sharecroppers  sanitation workers  teachers  students  ministers  priests  housewives  and activists   They were ordinary people with extraordinary vision who joined together and tore down the walls of legalized segregation and racial discrimination in this country   Only a few decades later  we cannot allow recent court decisions to turn back the clock and open the door to contemporary abuses   That is why Sen  Kennedy and I have worked so hard to meet every judicial step backward with a legislative step forward   We want to be able to say that on our watch  we did all we could as members of Congress to ensure the protection of civil rights in this country and hold discriminatory employers and individuals accountable   With the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 2008  we hope the 110th Congress will hold the same legacy  as a legislative body that continued the march toward a democracy in this country that ensures liberty and justice for all    I have been a long time supporter of efforts to rid the workplace of unlawful discrimination  and I believe the Civil Rights Act of 2008 is critical to achieving that important goal   said Leahy    This bill ensures that protections against workplace bias and discrimination  which conservative courts have attempted to roll back  are fully protected and restored   It is particularly important that  on the week that our nation observes and honors the legacy of Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr   Congress has introduced this bill   We must remain vigilant in ensuring our precious civil rights  which generations of Americans fought and bled to protect  remain available for our children and our grandchildren   I will continue to fight to end all workplace discrimination  including discrimination based on sexual orientation    The best way to honor the memory of Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  is to continue his work to ensure that America lives up to its promise of treating all citizens equally   said Dodd    The fight for civil rights will not be won or lost in a single battle  but instead is an ongoing struggle taking place in our workplaces  schools  and communities across the nation   I am honored to join Senator Kennedy and my colleagues in the Senate and Congressman John Lewis in the House of Representatives in introducing a bill that will give Americans the tools and support they need to defend themselves and others when their civil rights have been violated    We need to put teeth back in our civil rights laws   Senator Frank R  Lautenberg said    This bill would reaffirm the basic American value that everyone  regardless of race  gender or age  should have the same opportunities to succeed    This legislation is an important step in restoring the ability of Americans to protect their civil rights in courts   U S  Senator Jeff Bingaman said     I am proud to stand with Senator Kennedy and our colleagues to stop the assault on civil rights in our country   said Sen  Kerry   Too many brave Americans marched  fought  and faced down snarling dogs and fire hoses in the struggle for civil rights to have decades of progress erased by a few misguided decisions made by conservative judges   Our country is great because we believe in Jefferson s promise of God given inalienable rights for every citizen  and because we know it takes a government committed to protecting them to make the promise of civil rights real for the American people    Over 40 years ago Congress made it clear that discrimination is unacceptable in this country   said Harkin   In recent years however the Supreme Court has eroded these important laws and our action today is a first step towards restoring crucial civil rights protections in order to stamp out bigotry and injustice    The Supreme Court s decision in Alexander v  Sandoval sent a dangerous message about equity in this country   I am proud to team up with my colleagues to right this wrong   said Senator Mikulski   We need to reexamine what this country must still do to make sure that all Americans are protected from discriminatory acts   This bill ensures that those who have received injustice in the workplace have their fair day in court    There is no better way of honoring the civil rights movement than by working to address the erosion of protections we see today   said Senator Murray  Chair of the HELP Employment and Workplace Safety Subcommittee   This bill restores many of our most basic civil rights by confronting threats on the job and in our schools  We cannot continue to allow students to be harassed  employment laws to be marginalized  and discrimination to go unpunished  I am proud to support Senator Kennedy and Rep  Lewis in this effort   Senator Schumer said   For too long  the Supreme Court s cramped interpretations of civil rights statutes have closed the doors of the federal courts to people with claims of discrimination  This important legislation will right the wrong of those decisions  and restore Congress s original intent to protect all citizens by holding accountable those that violate our cherished civil rights    In recent years  we have seen courts erode key civil rights protections in our workplaces  our schools and our communities   said Senator Clinton    This important bill will reverse a number of these troubling decisions  and restore the promise of our nation s civil rights laws for millions of Americans    Too many hardworking Americans continue to face discrimination and unfair employment practices  and we must do everything we can to guarantee that all Americans receive fair and equal treatment under the law   said Senator Obama    Civil rights have to be at the forefront of our national dialogue  and we must ensure that those who suffer discrimination  whether by the federal government or private employers  can protect themselves legally   The Civil Rights Act of 2008 is an important step in our continuing battle against age discrimination  religious discrimination  the misuse of federal funds  and upholding workers  rights   I commend Chairman Kennedy for his leadership on this bill   and for his lifelong leadership on these issues   and urge my colleagues to quickly pass this legislation    Just because the calendar says 2008 doesn t mean that the need to fight for civil rights in our country is over   said Sen  Menendez   This week  we all reflected on the legacy of Dr  Martin Luther King  and this legislation helps carry on that legacy  Federal tax dollars should never be used to discriminate against or disadvantage our citizens  It is our responsibility to sustain our commitment to civil rights  and with this legislation  we can restore some of the major civil rights principles that have been diluted  I applaud Senator Kennedy for his continued leadership on civil rights    Discrimination for any reason has no place in America  The Civil Rights Act of 2008 is essential to restoring the balance to our system that provides equal opportunity for every American   said Senator Cardin   There has been a growing disregard of the original intent of Congress by many conservative judges in the area of civil rights law  For many  this has eroded their chance at achieving the American Dream  I believe Congress must act to reverse this troubling trend    This legislation bolsters the rights of Americans by ensuring there are consequences when an individual s civil rights are breached   Brown said   It is a bill that honors our constitution  and I am proud to support it                                   Pursuant to  policy

  Statement of Senator Barack Obama on the ASEAN Regional Forum Ministerial Meeting    U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Statement of Senator Barack Obama on the ASEAN Regional Forum Ministerial Meeting  Thursday  July 24  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Michael Ortiz Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice s attendance at the ASEAN Regional Forum  ARF  Ministerial meeting in Singapore is an opportunity for us to reflect on the relationship between the United States and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  and indeed Southeast Asia itself   After September 11  official U S  attention returned to Southeast Asia focusing especially on concerns about Islamic extremism in the region  This threat remains  coming from a small number of extremists living amidst a broadly tolerant and moderate Muslim population in Southeast Asia   But it must not be the sum total of our attention and interest in the region  Our alliances with Thailand and the Philippines  and special relationship with Singapore  remain critical components of our regional presence  Relations with Indonesia  Malaysia  and Vietnam will only become more essential to the security and prosperity of the United States  and the world  in coming years    Half of the world s oil passes through Southeast Asia s sea lanes  as does a third of global trade   U S  trade with the ten nations of ASEAN is more than  170 billion per year  making the region as a whole our fourth largest trading partner    ASEAN s impact extends beyond Southeast Asia and provides the model for  and in some cases the core of  many transnational institutions in the Asia Pacific region   ASEAN has led efforts to construct new vehicles for regional cooperation and confidence building among nations with histories of tension and mistrust  The ASEAN Regional Forum is one such organization   These efforts have helpfully supplemented the existing regional security arrangements  notably the U S  system of alliances  that have underwritten stability for generations   ASEAN is at a crossroads in its own institutional development  and in its relations with the United States    The new ASEAN Charter offers the promise of a more cohesive and assertive institution  one that demands respect for human rights from its member states  These emerging trends need to be strengthened  and I join the growing number of those in Southeast Asia who recognize that what happens in one ASEAN member country often affects the interests of others  As a U S  Senator  I will support ASEAN s efforts to evolve to accommodate this era of increasing inter dependency    I remain particularly concerned about conditions in Burma  I commend ASEAN for its attempts to reach the suffering people in southern Burma  who continue to struggle in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis  But more needs to be done to reach them  I hope the upcoming ARF meeting deals directly with this issue  as well as with broader plans for regional cooperation on humanitarian assistance to the country   I urge ASEAN to take the lead in a broader  long term effort to effect a coordinated international response to the situation in Burma that can encourage the junta toward reform and true national reconciliation in that country     The United States needs to strengthen its relationship with ASEAN  and we have some new opportunities to do just that   But to do so we must listen to the region s concerns and be part of the regional discussion  The United States should hold summit meetings with ASEAN s leaders   In addition  I am pleased that the United States is the first country to have an Ambassador for ASEAN Affairs  but that is only a beginning step   We should encourage others in the Asia Pacific region to work with us to strengthen ASEAN and to address a growing list of developmental challenges and new security threats  such as infectious disease  drug and human trafficking  environmental degradation  climate change  energy security and disaster mitigation  Attendance at Asian regional meetings sends important signals to the region s leaders about the importance of East Asia  and particularly Southeast Asia  to the continued security and prosperity of the United States   We should demonstrate unmistakably through our high level participation in such forums that our interests are profoundly engaged in the region  I have a deep personal interest in Southeast Asia  for four of the first ten years of my life  I lived in Indonesia with my mother and sister  My years there gave me an appreciation for the region s rich diversity of cultures  societies  and traditions  Our policy toward Southeast Asia should reflect an understanding of that diversity  and of the increasing importance of the region to the peace  stability and prosperity of the United States and the broader international community

        Senators Seek Tax Relief for Flood and Tornado Victims in the Midwest  Tuesday  June 24  2008  For Immediate Release  Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  WASHINGTON  D C     Senators Dick Durbin  D IL   Barack Obama  D IL   Chuck Grassley  R IA   Tom Harkin  D IA   Norm Coleman  R MN   Claire McCaskill  D MO   Kit Bond  R MO   Richard Lugar  R IN   Amy Klobuchar  D MN  and Evan Bayh  D IN  have filed an amendment to the housing legislation that s pending in the Senate   The amendment is a tax relief measure designed to help people and communities in Midwestern states hard hit over the last month by floods and tornados  The senators said the Midwestern Disaster Tax Relief bill is modeled after tax legislation that Congress passed to help victims of the tornado in Kiowa County  Kansas in 2007 and Hurricanes Katrina  Rita and Wilma in 2005   The new proposal contains provisions that would let disaster victims withdraw money from retirement plans without tax penalties  suspend limits on tax incentives for charitable contributions  create tax exempt bond authority to help rebuild infrastructure  remove limitations on deducting casualty losses due to natural disaster  and allow additional depreciation and increased amounts for expensing property to help businesses   As residents continue to battle the flooding back home in Illinois  I will continue to work in Washington to see that they have access to every federal recovery tool   Durbin said    Tax relief has proven to be extremely useful in helping people and communities get back on their feet after a major disaster   I hope Congress will act swiftly so Illinoisans will have immediate access to relief funds as soon as the President makes a disaster declaration for Illinois    Families and communities across Illinois have suffered so much due to this year s flooding  and we must do everything we can to help them recover and begin to rebuild   said Obama    I am proud to support this amendment to offer tax relief and assistance to the victims of this disaster   I will continue to work with Senator Durbin and my colleagues to help rebuild the Midwest in the days and weeks ahead     Tax relief has been important and helpful to tornado and hurricane victims in recent years  and it s just as important for people in Iowa and other Midwestern states this year who have been wiped out by flooding and tornados  including an EF5 tornado in Parkersburg  Iowa   Grassley said    The sooner Congress acts on this disaster tax relief  the better   People are working day and night to put their lives and their communities back together   There s so much hurt  but people are determined to get through it and rebuild   Given the enormity of the loss in Iowa  I hope Congress can find a way to act quickly to help through tax relief  along with other measures     Iowans and our neighbors in the Midwest have endured a tough year with floods  tornadoes and other natural disasters   Harkin said    While the storms may be behind us  many families have experienced huge losses   loss of their homes  belongings and livelihoods  Communities large and small are facing the daunting task of rebuilding their entire infrastructure  Now is the time to offer relief and assistance to the people of Iowa and the Midwest     Missourians are in a world of hurt right now   Many of our small communities  thousands of businesses and homes  have been devastated by rising flood waters   This amendment will help to make sure that America s heartland will have the resources they need to recover from the floods   McCaskill said   Too often  Missourians are reminded of nature s tremendous devastating power   Bond said    These provisions will help Missourians and other Midwestern families recover after being hard hit by Mother Nature   It is critical that we provide our communities the resources they need to get back on their feet     Disasters can take away lives  they can destroy homes  and they can wipe away roads and bridges  But in America  we won t let them take away our spirit of community   Klobuchar said    At a time like this  local communities should not be expected to fend for themselves   this relief will help these communities begin to recover and rebuild from the devastating flooding in the Midwest     In the last several weeks  thousands of residents in Indiana  like so many across the Midwest  have had their lives chaotically disrupted by storms  tornadoes and floods   Bayh said   Time is not our ally in getting resources to ravaged communities  Congress must move quickly to pass this legislation  and then we must act to appropriate additional funds  to deliver critical aid to storm victims so they can rebuild their homes  their businesses and their lives   A summary of the amendment filed this morning is below   The legislation would benefit Iowa  Illinois  Missouri  Indiana  Kansas  Minnesota  Wisconsin  Michigan and

                           CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today released the following statement on the visit of Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to the United States   I welcome the visit this week of Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and her delegation to the United States   President Arroyo s visit is an opportunity to strengthen our historic alliance  and to discuss a host of issues of mutual interest     I wish first to express my sympathies through President Arroyo to the victims and families of typhoon Fengshen  which has just hit the southern portion of the Philippines  leaving tremendous devastation in its wake   I urge the U S  government to provide emergency support to alleviate the suffering caused by this catastrophic natural disaster   The bond between the United States and the Philippines is strong and enduring  The Philippines has been an important ally of the United States through World War II  the Cold War  and now the fight against terrorism and extremism  The 1954 Manila Pact formed a cornerstone of U S  policy in Southeast Asia during the Cold War  and the Philippines continues to be one of only two U S  treaty allies in Southeast Asia today   After the events of September 11  2001  the Philippines has worked closely with the United States to root out Al Qaeda and its affiliates in the region     Annual joint military exercises  named  Balikatan   or  Shoulder to Shoulder   have been a model of cooperation  and form the core of U S  Philippine military to military activities to support the Philippines with its ongoing defense reform efforts   I support these continuing programs  including upgrading and enhancing the military s equipment and training   The agenda for President Arroyo s visit is full   Together  we must address many challenges going forward  including the future of ASEAN  the continuing tragedy in Burma  implementation of recently authorized Millennium Challenge Account assistance  and alleviation of the effects of the global food crisis on the Philippines   We should deal with these challenges with confidence in the foundation of our common interests and the shared values on which our relationship is based     President Arroyo will also come to offer her appreciation for the United States Senate s passage of the Veterans  Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007 in April   This legislation would offer Filipino veterans the benefits they rightfully deserve for their heroic service during World War II   Filipino and American troops fought bravely together under some of the most trying conditions suffered by any forces during that conflict  Filipinos displayed great courage alongside American soldiers at Bataan and Corregidor  only to be denied their just benefits by our government  I join President Arroyo in urging my colleagues in Congress to honor the heroic service of Filipino World War II veterans by finally turning this important legislation into law   The most important part of our bilateral relationship is the deep and abiding people to people bond that our two nations share   I grew up in Hawaii  where Filipinos have had an enormous positive impact on the culture and the economy  Across the United States  generations of Filipino immigrants have enriched our society and contributed to building a more vibrant United States of America  The continuing bond they have with the land of their heritage resonates in the strong families and communities they have woven into the fabric of American society   As dedicated citizens  Filipino Americans  4 million strong   embody our nation s highest ideals   The Philippines has a proud legacy as Asia s first democracy  a legacy that should be honored and cherished but never taken for granted by the American people   I have great hope for the Philippines and admiration for its people   I extend a warm welcome to President Arroyo on her visit to the United States  and I look forward to working with her and her country in years to come as the Philippine people work together with us toward a better and more secure future for our two

  Senators Introduce Bipartisan Ethanol Education and Expansion Act   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senators Introduce Bipartisan Ethanol Education and Expansion Act Thursday  May 24  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact   Linden Zakula  Klobuchar   Ben LaBolt  Obama   Shana Marchio  Bond   Garrette Silverman  Voinovich   or Max Gleischman  Durbin    Legislation would provide Americans with cheaper and environmentally friendly fuel   Washington  D C      Today in an effort to provide Americans relief from record high gas prices U S  Senators Amy Klobuchar  D MN   Barack Obama   D IL   Kit Bond  R MO   George Voinovich  R OH   and Dick Durbin  D IL  introduced legislation to expand consumer access to 85 percent ethanol fuel  or E 85  an affordable  home grown alternative to gasoline   The Ethanol Education and Expansion Act of 2007 would work to reduce prices at the pump for consumers by providing grants through the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  to farmer owned ethanol producers to install additional E 85 pumps at rural gas stations as well as the equipment needed to sell E 85 directly to gas stations    Gas prices topped  3 22 nationwide this week  Americans can only fill up half their tanks  and the oil companies are raking in record profits   people want cheaper and environmentally safe alternative fuels  like E 85   remarked Sen  Klobuchar    This bill not only helps Americans pay less at the pump by making sure they can find E 85 at their local gas station  but it helps the farmers of the Midwest invest in homegrown renewable energy     Reducing our nation s consumption of gasoline and encouraging the use of renewable fuels  like ethanol  are important steps in combating global climate change   said Sen  Obama    Expanding our ethanol infrastructure  as this legislation proposes  will inject competition into the market  give Americans the power to choose domestically produced  environmentally friendly fuel and reduce our dependence on expensive foreign oil    Ethanol has become a popular alternative for the 6 million Americans with flexible fuel vehicles  vehicles capable of using gas or E 85 as fuel  looking for relief at the pump and an environmentally friendly fuel   However  many consumers have a hard time finding E 85  since it is available at just 1 200 stations     less than one percent of the approximately 170 000 gas stations in the U S    As hard working Americans continue to feel the pain at the pump  we need to provide access to more energy alternatives to fuel consumers   said Sen  Bond  This bill is a good step towards making our country more energy independent  The addition of E 85 pumps will better serve our nation s need for a reliable renewable resource     Keeping America competitive in the global marketplace requires an overhaul of our national energy policy     we must become less reliant on foreign sources on energy   Sen  Voinovich said   To do so  we must increase our energy supply  conserve more energy and explore and expand our use of new technologies including E 85  Our bill will help dramatically increase the availability of E 85  making it a viable source of fuel for everyday Americans who are committed to our nation s energy independence    As part of the grant program  the bill would allow farmer owned ethanol producers to install the infrastructure needed to bypass oil companies and sell E 85 directly to gas stations  This would ensure that American farmers receive the benefits of home grown fuels such as E 85   The bill would also create the new E 85 Education Program  which would award competitive grants to non profit organizations to educate gas station owners  vehicle fleet operators and the general public about the benefits and availability of E 85   Currently  most ethanol is sold to oil companies who then re sell to gas stations  often at higher prices  Klobuchar s bipartisan proposal eliminates the middle man  thus reducing prices at the pump for consumers and keeping energy dollars in the Midwest instead of lining the pockets of oil cartels in the Middle East    Renewable fuels are one of the keys to America s drive toward energy independence   These fuels reduce our reliance on foreign oil and enhance our ability to control our own security and economic future     while helping our farmers by increasing demand for their crops   Durbin said   One of the biggest challenges in increasing the use of renewable fuels is that many consumers don t have access to fuels like E 85   This legislation takes an important step toward overcoming this hurdle and paves a path to greater production and use of renewable fuels    Sen  Klobuchar will work to include the legislation in the 2007 Farm Bill  which the Senate is expected to take up in the coming months  The bill sets the amount of federal grant assistance at 20 percent of the total project cost  providing enough funding to complete 1 000 2 000 new E 85 pumps over the five year life of the Farm Bill   Senators Ben Nelson  D NE   Hilary Clinton  D NY   Debbie Stabenow  D MI   Sherrod Brown  D OH   Claire McCaskill  D MO   and John Kerry  D MA  are also co sponsors of the legislation                                    ,Obama

  Obama  Comprehensive Immigration Reform Should be Tough  Respect Nation   s Values   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  Comprehensive Immigration Reform Should be Tough  Respect Nation   s Values Wednesday  May 23  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt   WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today spoke on the Senate floor about comprehensive immigration reform  saying comprehensive and bipartisan immigration reform is necessary and should strengthen our security  promote our economic interests  and reaffirm our heritage as a nation of immigrants   Obama announced plans to introduce an amendment with Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  that would remove that arbitrary minimum threshold of points before family preference is considered and increase the points for family ties   Under the current agreement  an applicant would have to obtain 55 points through other criteria before receiving points for family ties   He said he intends to introduce a second amendment with Senator Menendez that would sunset the immigration point system in five years and call on Congress to examine the consequences of the program and determine whether it should continue   Senator Obama   s floor statement is below       Last year  I spoke at one of the marches in Chicago for comprehensive immigration reform   I looked out across the faces in the crowd  I saw mothers and fathers  citizens and immigrants  people of Polish and Mexican descent  working Americans  and children          And what I know is that these are people we should embrace  not fear   We can and should be able to see ourselves in them          I do not say that to diminish the complexity of the task   I say it because I believe it must guide our discourse   We can and should be able to fix our broken immigration system   I think the bill that has come to the floor is a fine first step  but it still requires some changes  and I am working with others to improve it           In approaching immigration reform  I believe that we must enact tough  practical reforms that ensure and promote the legal and orderly entry of immigrants into our country   Just as important  we must respect the humanity of the carpenters and bricklayers who help build America  the humanity of garment workers and farm workers who come to America to join their families  the humanity of the students like my father who come to America in search of the dream   We are a nation of immigrants  and we must respect that shared history as this debate moves forward          To fix the system in a way that does not require us to revisit the same problem in twenty years  I continue to believe that we need stronger enforcement on the border and at the workplace   And that means a workable mandatory system that employers must use to verify the legality of their workers          But for reform to work  we also must respond to what pulls people to America and what pushes them out of their home countries   Where we can reunite families  we should   Where we can bring in more foreign born workers with the skills our economy needs  we should   And these goals are not mutually exclusive   We should not say that Spanish speaking or working class immigrants are only good enough to be temporary workers and cannot earn the right to be part of the American family          With regard to the most pressing part of the immigration challenge     the 12 million undocumented immigrants living in the U S      we must create an earned path to citizenship   Now  no one condones unauthorized entry into the United States   And by supporting an earned path to citizenship  I am not saying that illegal entry should go unpunished   The path to permanent residence and eventual citizenship must be tough enough to make it clear that unauthorized entry was wrong          But these immigrants are our neighbors   They go to our churches  and their kids go to our schools   They provide the hard labor that supports many of the industries in our country   We should bring them out of hiding  make them pay the appropriate fines for their mistakes  and then help them become tax paying  law abiding  productive members of society          I am heartened by the agreement that we have to put all 12 million undocumented immigrants on a path to earned citizenship   But there are other parts of the compromise deal before us that cause me serious concern           Let me briefly address some of those concerns          In order to stem the demand for illegal workers  we need a mandatory employment verification system that is actually mandatory   It needs to allow employers to check with the Department of Homeland Security to see that their employees are legally eligible to work in the United States   This is something I worked on last year   But this year   s version of the employment eligibility verification system would give DHS too much power to force the screening of everyone working in America without appropriate safeguards   I will be working with others to offer an amendment to make this provision closer to what we proposed last year          As for the guestworker program in the bill  it proposes to create a new 400 000 person annual temporary worker program that could grow to 600 000 without Congressional approval   And it expands the existing seasonal guestworker programs from 66 000 up to 100 000 in the first year and 200 000 after that   At the end of their temporary status  almost all of these workers would have to go home   That means at the end of the first three years  we would have at least 1 2 million of these new guestworkers in the country with only 30 000 of those having any real hope of getting to stay   That will just create a new undocumented immigrant population          As we have learned with misguided immigration policies in the past  it is na  ve to think that people who do not have a way to stay legally will just abide by the system and leave   They won   t   This new group of second class workers will replace the current group of undocumented immigrants  placing downward pressure on American wages and working conditions   And when their time is up  they will go into the shadows where our current system exploits the undocumented today         I will support amendments aimed at fixing the temporary worker program that Senator Bingaman and others will be offering   And if we   re going to have a new temporary worker program  those workers should have an opportunity to stay if they prove themselves capable          But the most disturbing aspect of this bill is the point system for future immigrants   As currently drafted  it does not reflect how much Americans value the family ties that bind people to their brothers and sisters or to their parents          As I understand it  a similar point system is used in Australia and Canada and is intended to attract immigrants who can help produce more goods   But we need to consider more than economics  we also need to consider our nation s unique history and values and what family based preferences are designed to accomplish   As currently structured  the points system gives no preference to an immigrant with a brother or sister or even a parent who is a United States citizen unless the immigrant meets some minimum and arbitrary threshold on education and skills          That   s wrong and fails to recognize the fundamental morality of uniting Americans with their family members   It also places a person   s job skills over his character and work ethic   How many of our forefathers would have measured up under this point system   How many would have been turned back at Ellis Island          I have cosponsored an amendment with Senator Menendez to remove that arbitrary minimum threshold of points before family starts to count and to bump up the points for family ties          And at the appropriate time  I will be offering another amendment with Senator Menendez  to sunset the points system in the bill   The proposed point system constitutes  at a minimum  a radical experiment in social engineering and a departure from our tradition of having family and employers invite immigrants to come   If we are going to allow this to go forward  then Congress should revisit the point system in five years to give us time to examine the concept in depth and determine whether its intended or unintended consequences are worth the cost of continuing the experiment or whether we should return to the existing system that allows immigrants to be sponsored through family and employers          In closing  we must construct a final product that has broad bipartisan support and will work   The time to fix our broken immigration system is now   If we do not fix it this year  I fear that divisions over the issue will only deepen and the challenge will grow                                      ,Obama

Barack Obama  D IL  and Christopher Bond  R MO  sent the following letter to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates  requesting a full accounting of service members    psychological injuries  including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD   since October 2001   The senators also requested a detailed report on how the military monitors other psychological injuries   Recent media accounts indicate that the number of service members seeking care for PTSD from the Veterans Administration  VA  increased 70  over a 12 month period  or an increase of some 20 000 cases   In addition  reports of the total number of cases of PTSD treatment at the VA since 2001     50 000 cases     far exceed the number of wounded documented by the Pentagon   In the letter  Obama and Bond request information including the total number of PTSD among active duty service members  the total number of other reported psychological injuries  the procedures and referral mechanisms for service members to seek counseling while in combat  the number of mental health staff deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan  the number of mental health staff for each major mobilization and demobilization site  the incentives in place to attract additional behavioral health specialists  and the total annual expenditure on mental health care for active duty service members   The text of the letter is below October 23  2007 The Honorable Robert M  Gates  Secretary of Defense  The Pentagon  Washington  D C  20301 1000 Dear Secretary Gates    We are writing to request a full accounting from the Department of Defense on the number of psychological injuries sustained by service members since October 2001 and how the military reports on and invests in treating these less visible psychological injuries   Recent media accounts indicate that the number of service members seeking care for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  from the Veterans Administration  VA  jumped 70  over a 12 month period  or an increase of some 20 000 cases   In addition  reports of the total number of cases of PTSD treatment at the VA since 2001     50 000 cases     far exceed the number of wounded documented by the Pentagon     While the literature suggests that symptoms of psychological injuries such as PTSD often surface after the initial trauma  these reported numbers not only underscore the increase in demand for mental health resources among our veterans  but suggest that many of our brave active duty service members are sustaining less visible psychological injuries at a time when the military faces a severe shortage of behavioral health personnel   As a result  many of our warriors may lack access to care just at a time when early treatment could be beneficial   In light of the fact that mental health care is now the second largest area of VA treatment sought by Iraq and Afghanistan veterans  it is incumbent on the military to ensure it is providing adequate treatment before our warriors ever separate from service   Especially in combat theaters  where recent reports also suggest a spike in suicides  we must ensure service members facing the stress of combat operations have access to resources and care for psychological injuries    For these reasons  we ask that you provide the following information    What is the total number of cases of PTSD among active duty service members documented by each military department since October 2001   Please distinguish between those cases that were diagnosed in and out of a combat theater   Is this number reported in the Pentagon   s regular compilation of wounded injured figures  whether or not cases require a medical evacuation   Of this number  how many received treatment from a mental health professional    What is the total number of other reported psychological injuries documented by each military department since October 2001   Please distinguish between those cases that were diagnosed in and out of a combat theater   Is this number reported in the Pentagon   s regular compilation of wounded injured figures  whether or not cases require a medical evacuation   Of this number  how many received treatment from a mental health professional   What procedures and referral mechanisms are in place in each military department for a service member who may want to seek counseling in a combat theater   How are service members currently trained to identify symptoms of combat stress   What is the approximate number of mental health staff  differentiated by specialty  deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan  by calendar quarter and military department  since October 2001   Of this number  on average how many are embedded with units in forward operating areas    What is the number of mental health staff  differentiated by specialty  for each major mobilization and demobilization Army and Marine Corps site  Please provide the number of military personnel assigned to each of these installations   What incentives are in place  or being considered  to attract additional behavioral health specialists  differentiated by specialty   For Fiscal Year 2002 through 2007  what has been the total annual expenditure  by quarter and military department  on mental health care for active duty service members   Of these totals  how much was expended for staffing  both for military personnel and private contractors    Caring for the mental health of our service members should be as important as caring for their physical wounds   Thank you for providing this information to our offices by November 13  2007    Sincerely  Barack Obama

Obama Calls on Gates to Clarify Contractor Role in Iraq Thursday  September 20  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 Asks for Answers from Pentagon on Blackwater  Obama bill would promote contractor accountability and transparency WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  sent the following letter to U S  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates  calling on him to answer questions about the Blackwater incident and the role of private security contractors and the impact of their operations in Iraq    In February  Obama introduced the Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act  S  674   which would require federal agencies to report to Congress on the number of security contractors  the military and security equipment they use  the number of contractors killed and wounded  and any disciplinary action taken against them   This legislation would also improve coordination between security contractors and the U S  military  and require investigation of criminal misconduct engaged in by contractors    Obama offered this legislation as an amendment to the FY 2008 Defense Authorization bill  which is currently before the Senate  The text of the letter is below  Dear Mr  Secretary   I am writing with regard to an incident in Baghdad earlier this week involving the State Department s security escort  which is made up of armed private contractors from the Blackwater firm   During a firefight last weekend  Blackwater security contractors killed 8 people and wounded 14 others  This incident  which is under investigation at the Department of State  raises larger questions about the role of private security contractors   An estimated 48 000 private security employees are operating in Iraq  and more than 1 000 contractors have died in Iraq since 2003   As last weekend   s incident illustrates  little is known about what functions these security contractors are performing  how much their services are costing  what military and safety equipment they are provided  and what rules of engagement they are following   For that reason  in February  I introduced the Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act  S  674    The bill would require federal agencies to report to Congress on   the total number of security contractors  the total cost of the contractors  the number of contractors killed or wounded  information about the military and safety equipment provided to contractors  and a description of disciplinary action taken against contractors   The bill would improve coordination between security contractors and U S  armed forces by requiring the issuance of rules of engagement  clarify the legal status of contractors  and require investigation of criminal misconduct engaged in by contractors  In an effort to learn more about Blackwater   s operations in Iraq  I am interested in getting your reaction to several issues under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense    1   The press has reported several other instances involving Blackwater  including a reported shooting of the Iraqi Vice President s security guard  reported shootings of Interior Ministry employees  and reported armed standoffs between Blackwater employees and Iraqi police   Has the Pentagon investigated these or other incidents   If yes  what were the results of those investigations   2   Last year  Congress enacted and the President signed into law a provision stating that contractors operating in contingency operations would potentially fall under the Uniform Code of Military Justice  UCMJ    Is it your view that any illegal actions by private security contractors in Iraq would be punishable under the UCMJ   If not  under what legal process would they be held accountable   3   More than 13 000 private security contractors have been reported wounded in Iraq and reports suggest that many suffer from the same challenges that many of our soldiers  including post traumatic stress disorder  once they return home   What steps are their contracting firms taking to ensure long term care for employees that require it   4   Lastly  I am concerned about the impact of this incident     and similar incidents     on our overall effort to end the war in Iraq   Has the Department of Defense conducted an analysis of the consequences of turning over such armed functions in a war zone to contractors outside the chain of command  and whether this outsourcing is actually hurting  rather than helping  our counter insurgency efforts  especially in winning local hearts and minds   I look forward to your prompt responses to these questions   Thank you  Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator                                  ,Obama

thousand workers are now without jobs   said Obama    These airlines collapsed in the face of skyrocketing fuel prices  a consolidating aviation industry  and a declining economy   I join Senator

attached   April 25  2008 The Honorable Elaine L  Chao  U S  Department of Labor  200 Constitution Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20210 Dear Secretary Chao  The termination of operations of Aloha Airlines and ATA Airlines has resulted in the abrupt dislocation of over 1 200 flight attendants and other personnel  including customer service agents    Given the current state of the aviation industry  it will be difficult for these working Americans to find new jobs in the shrinking US airline industry   In the past  many dislocated or furloughed flight attendants found jobs with other carriers  but the job market in aviation today is poor  The Aloha and ATA flight attendants who are now unemployed had served more than 10 years on average in their specialized fields   The length of service with their company means that the vast majority of these flight attendants have not participated in the job market for more than a decade  A successful transition to a new career requires targeted dislocated worker intervention services   For these particular workers  and especially the flight attendants  whose unemployment follows years of wage and work rule concessions during bankruptcy for their carrier  we urge you to consider releasing National Emergency Grant funds to address their specific re training needs    We urge you to quickly evaluate whether the termination of operations of Aloha Airlines and ATA Airlines qualify as eligible events for National Emergency Grant  NEG  funding  and if so identify these flight attendants as a target population eligible for specialized assistance    If the flight attendants qualify  we further request that you issue a special guidance letter to all states and local workforce investment boards to announce the immediate availability of NEG funds and to encourage the development of expanded dislocated intervention services for these flight attendants   If they do not qualify  we request an explanation and alternative services that the Department can make available to them  We ask that you make this determination as quickly as possible and notify us as soon as that decision is made                                    Pursuant to

                  Obama Testifies About Plan to Reduce Lobbyist Influence and Clean Up Washington Wednesday  February  8  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green    Date  February 8  2006  Obama Testifies About Plan to Reduce Lobbyist Influence and Clean Up Washington   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today testified before the Senate Rules Committee about legislation he has introduced to help increase transparency and accountability in government and help clean up Washington    Below  please find Senator Obama s testimony as well as a more detailed explanation of the legislation   TESTIMONY OF SENATOR BARACK OBAMA  SENATE RULES COMMITTEE  FEBRUARY 8  2006   Chairman Lott  Senator Dodd  thank you for giving me the opportunity to testify today about this important subject    I m here to testify about three pieces of legislation that I ve played a role in drafting and that I believe are worth serious consideration by this Committee    Since the very first time I spoke out on lobbying reform  I have said over and over what I still believe to be true today   that while some are clearly to blame for the corruption that has plagued Washington  all of us   Democrats and Republicans   are responsible for cleaning it up   That s why I hope to work in a bipartisan manner on reform  and that s what I hope this legislation can provide a foundation for        The first bill is the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act  which already has the support of 41 members of the Senate   The bill takes a number of significant steps to fundamentally change the way we do business in Washington     First  it would lengthen the cooling off period to two years for lawmakers and staff who seek to become lobbyists  and it would require immediate disclosure as soon as any job negotiations begin   This would end the stories we ve heard about working on a prescription drug bill during the day while you re talking about your future salary with the drug industry at night     Second  the bill would open conference committee meetings to the public and require that all bills be posted on the Internet for 24 hours before they re voted on  so the public can scrutinize them to prevent special interest provisions from being slipped in during the dead of night       Third  the bill would end all lobbyist funded gifts  meals  and travel and strengthen the Senate office that monitors lobbyist disclosure forms     If enacted  this bill would go a long way towards ending the cozy relationship between lawmakers and lobbyists   But I believe we can take some additional key steps   And that s why I m introducing two more bills today    The first deals with enforcement   We can pass all the new ethics rules in the world  but if we don t establish a body that can monitor and enforce those rules  it ll be easy to break them   That s why this bill calls for a nonpartisan  independent Congressional Ethics Enforcement Commission   This Commission would be staffed with former judges and former members of Congress  and it would allow any citizen to report a possible ethics violation by lawmakers  staff  or lobbyists   The Commission would have the authority to conduct investigations  issue subpoenas  and provide public reports to the Senate Ethics Committee or Department of Justice so that any wrongdoing can be punished accordingly        To prevent this Commission from being manipulated for partisan political purposes  the bill establishes stiff sanctions for the filing of frivolous complaints  and prohibits the filing of complaints 30 days before a primary election and 60 days before a general election    This proposal is modeled after similar commissions in Kentucky  Florida  and Tennessee that have worked very well   particularly in Kentucky    I believe it s a good model for how to reform our ethics process in Congress  and I m pleased that this bill is supported by Common Cause    Norm Ornstein at the American Enterprise Institute  who is an expert on the workings of Congress  has said this about my enforcement bill    This approach to ethics enforcement is just the kind of balanced and reasonable alternative we need   Enforcement of ethics in Congress needs independence and credibility to all  but cannot become either a vehicle for the criminalization of policy differences or an avenging angel like the Independent Counsel statute created    This commission would have on it people of integrity and institutional sensitivity  and could serve to educate members and staff about ethical behavior and performance while also providing vigorous and credible enforcement of ethical standards   It deserves strong bipartisan support     I m also introducing a second bill today that would bring greater transparency to earmarks so that we can save taxpayer dollars and end the special interest abuse of this process   This is area that many of our colleagues are interested in reforming   Sen  McCain has already discussed the proposals that he s working on with Sen  Coburn   And I know Chairman Lott and Sen  Feinstein have introduced an earmarks bill as well    The bill I am proposing today builds on the earmark provisions in the CLEAN UP Act that I introduced last month with eight senators and includes language from a proposal by Rep  Obey   My new bill would require that information about all earmarks  including the name of the lawmaker requesting it and a justification of why they want it  be disclosed 72 hours before they are considered by the full Senate     The bill would also place some common sense limits on earmarks   Members would be prohibited from advocating for an earmark if they have a financial interest in the project or its recipient   Earmarks also could not be used to secure promises from lawmakers in exchange for a vote on a bill   These earmark reforms won t solve every abuse  but the idea is this   if you re proud enough about an earmark to issue a press release about it  then you should be able to defend it to the public     I hope that this committee will take into consideration these proposals as well as others that can serve as the basis for real and effective lobbying reform   Again  I hope to do this in a bipartisan manner   But I will say this   the true test of bipartisanship is not whether we pass a bill that appeals to a lowest common denominator that we can all agree on  it s whether we pass the strongest bill with the strongest reforms possible that can truly change the way we do business in Washington   That s what the American people will be watching for  and that s what we owe them in the end    THE CONGRESSIONAL ETHICS ENFORCEMENT COMMISSION ACT Senator Barack Obama has proposing the creation of a Congressional Ethics Enforcement Commission to receive complaints from the public on alleged ethics violations by members of Congress  staff  and lobbyists   The Commission would have authority to investigate complaints and present public findings of fact about possible violations to the House and Senate Ethics Committee and Justice Department   This proposal  which is endorsed by Common Cause and Norm Ornstein  is modeled after similar state commissions in Kentucky  Florida  and Tennessee   Composition  The Commission would be comprised of nine Commissioners chosen by the leaders of Congress   Four of the Commissioners must be former federal judges  and four must be former members of Congress   During their service  Commissioners would be prohibited from serving as a fundraiser for a Senate or House candidate  contributing to a candidate for federal office  serving as an officer in a political party  acting as a registered lobbyist  and participating in the management or conduct of a political campaign   Investigative Powers  In conducting its investigations of alleged violations  the Commission would have the authority to issue subpoenas  compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents  and take depositions    All Commission proceedings  including the initial complaint  would remain confidential until a final determination is made   Following a preliminary investigation of a complaint  the Commission would have several options   dismiss the complaint  confidentially inform the alleged violator of potential violations and provide information to ensure future compliance with the law  or upon a majority vote  initiate an adjudicatory proceeding to determine whether to present a case to the House and Senate Ethics Committee or the Department of Justice  The House and Senate Ethics Committee and the Department of Justice would retain the ultimate authority to discipline members of Congress   Frivolous Complaints  To avoid manipulation of the Commission for political purposes  any person filing a complaint that they knew to be false would be subject to a  10 000 fine and up to one year in jail   That person also would be barred from filing any future complaints    No complaints could be filed against a member of Congress in the three months prior to an election to ensure that complaints are not filed for political purposes   THE INTEGRITY IN EARMARKS ACT   Senator Barack Obama has proposed a bill to increase transparency and accountability in earmarks   The bill would require the following   All earmarks  including the name of the requestor and a justification for the earmark  would be disclosed 72 hours before they can be considered by the full Senate   All earmarks would have to be listed in the actual bill  not just the committee report   All earmarks would have to be germane to the bill in which they are contained   Senators would be prohibited from advocating for an earmark if they have a financial interest in the project or earmark recipient   Earmarks may not be used to secure promises from senators that they will vote a certain way on a bill   Earmark recipients must disclose to an Office of Public Integrity the amount that they have spent on registered lobbyists and the names of those lobbyists                                     ,Obama

  Obama Joins Boxer  Senators to Introduce Bill to Reverse EPA Global Warming Waiver Decision   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama Joins Boxer  Senators to Introduce Bill to Reverse EPA Global Warming Waiver Decision Friday  January 25  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT Peter Rafle  Boxer EPW   Kate Gilman  Boxer EPW   or Michael Ortiz  Obama   Washington  DC   U S  Senator Barbara Boxer  D CA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works  introduced legislation today that would direct the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to grant California a waiver under the Clean Air Act to cut global warming pollution from motor vehicles      Cosponsors of the bill include Senators Dianne Feinstein  D CA   Joseph Lieberman  ID  CT   Hillary Clinton  D NY   Frank Lautenberg  D NJ   Benjamin Cardin  D MD   Bernie Sanders  I VT   Sheldon Whitehouse  D RI   Edward Kennedy  D MA   Patrick Leahy  D VT   Christopher Dodd  D CT   John Kerry  D MA   Barbara A  Mikulski  D MD   Olympia Snowe  R ME   Susan Collins  R ME   Bill Nelson  D FL   Barack Obama  D  IL   and Roberts Menendez  D NJ   Senator Boxer said   Administrator Johnson s decision to deny the waiver was not supported by the facts  by the law  by the science  or by precedent   I will use every available tool to ensure that California and the nation are able to reduce the pollution that causes global warming   One of those tools is legislation that essentially overturns Mr  Johnson s actions   Senator Obama said   Effectively tackling global warming demands bold and innovative solutions  and given the failure of this Administration to act  California should be allowed to pioneer   I commend Chairman Boxer for her leadership on this bill and on working to eliminate the damaging consequences of climate change around the world   Senator Feinstein said   It s become clear that Administrator Johnson s denial of California s waiver was based on politics  not science  Even the EPA s own experts have said that there was a compelling need for action   So  today  Senator Boxer and I have introduced legislation to take this decision out of the hands of the EPA   and allow California to move ahead with curbing tailpipe emissions   Bottom line  I m committed to protecting California s landmark global warming efforts   and will do everything in my power to ensure that this Administration doesn t stand in the way   Senator Lieberman said   The vision and leadership of California  Connecticut  and the other states that have moved to curb global warming pollution from cars should be rewarded by the grant of authority to implement the states  programs   In the wake of the Bush administration s failure to follow federal law and deliver the needed authority  we in Congress must step in with legislation that gives the states the go ahead to fight climate change   Senator Clinton said   It is outrageous that the Bush Administration chose to block the efforts of New York  California and many other states that want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles  Chairman Boxer s continued oversight on this issue is critically important  and I am proud to join with her in introducing legislation to overturn EPA s wrongheaded decision and allow states to move forward on global warming   Senator Lautenberg said   It s bad enough the Bush Administration has been sitting on its hands and done virtually nothing to fight global warming  but now it s trying to block states from taking strong action on their own   Our legislation would work to overturn this misguided decision and allow states like New Jersey and California to continue their efforts to reduce greenhouse gases and combat global warming    Senator Cardin said   The EPA has clearly chosen to ignore the issue of global warming   It s time that States are allowed to take meaningful action to protect the health of their citizens by reducing greenhouse gas emissions    Senator Sanders told the EPA administrator   If you can t do the right thing  at least get out of the way of California  Vermont and other states   If we do not move aggressively  this planet is in danger   Senator Whitehouse said   Allowing Rhode Island and all these states to set tough vehicle emissions standards is one of the strongest and most common sense steps we can take to begin to tackle the enormous challenge of global warming   But once again  this administration has put blind ideology before science  once again  this administration has let politics govern policy  and once again  this administration has taken an action that will directly undermine our efforts to protect our environment and safeguard public health   I applaud Chairman Boxer s commitment to addressing this issue and am proud to cosponsor this important bill   Senator Kennedy said   It s extremely unfortunate that the Administration has stood in the way of states  efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles   I commend Senator Boxer for her leadership in filing this bill  which is so vital to states like Massachusetts and California which are ready to do the things necessary to curb global warming in spite of the obstacles EPA has set   Senator Leahy said   The Bush Administration has been AWOL or worse on air quality issues  and now they even want to undermine states like California and Vermont that are trying to pick up the slack   They won t lead and they won t follow  so the Boxer bill would force them at least to get out of the way and stop obstructing states like ours that are trying to lead on clean air policy   Senator Dodd said   The EPA s decision in December to deny the request by California  Connecticut  and 15 other states for the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles was a politically motivated roadblock erected to stop responsible solutions to the growing problem of global warming   Indeed  evidence suggests that EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson ignored the advice of his own climate experts  who recommended that this request be approved  This bill restores those efforts to address one of the most pressing issues of our day   I thank Senator Boxer for her leadership on this issue and am committed to seeing this important piece of legislation passed   Senator Kerry said   If the Bush Administration refuses to combat climate change  they at least need to get out of the way when the states do   California needs this waiver  and deserves a lot of credit for meeting an environmental challenge with the reform it demands   Senator Mikulski said   The world is facing a climate crisis and we must act now   Maryland and a number of other states have already joined California in setting a higher bar to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles than the federal government has   The country is looking to us for leadership   As we continue to assist our manufacturing industries in making this transition  we need to set the standard so states can do the right thing   Senator Snowe said   I am deeply disappointed that the Administration failed to follow the statute outlined in the Clean Air Act that allows California to adopt distinct environmental laws  This is a setback for Maine and as well as our national environmental stewardship   Although I am confident that the court system will ultimately overturn this decision  I am troubled that this Administration has unnecessarily delayed enactment of a strong curtailment of greenhouse gas emissions  This legislation will allow the states to move forward with enacting strong reductions in green house gas emissions filling the void of federal action   Senator Collins said   Climate change is one of the most daunting challenges we face and we must develop reasonable solutions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions    If states  like my home state of Maine  establish reasonable standards to help address this serious problem  the federal government should not stand in the way   Senator Nelson said   The failure of the Bush administration to allow states to clean up auto emissions means that Congress is going to have to step in and pass this legislation    Sen  Menendez said   Our planet is in peril and this administration simply refuses to let anyone do very much about it  Under this administration  the EPA is acting like the  Environmental Pollution Agency   Since they won t act  states that want to undertake serious efforts to clean our air should not have their hands tied  New Jersey is one of those states and I will stand up for our right to help save our planet  I applaud Chairwoman Boxer for her leadership on this issue   The bill introduced today directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to grant California s request for the waiver  which will allow California to implement its greenhouse gas emissions standards for motor vehicles   The waiver will also permit other states to adopt California s emissions standards    Fourteen other states have adopted California s standards  or are in the process of adopting them   Another four are moving toward adopting the California standards   All together  those 19 states represent

Also urge president to act on commission recommendations released today WASHINGTON  D C      As the President   s Commission on Care for America   s Returning Wounded made recommendations to the Bush Administration concerning care for soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan  the U S  Senate unanimously approved legislation inspired by U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Claire McCaskill  D MO    s Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act   Both Obama and McCaskill applauded the Senate   s actions to improve health care and the recovery process for service members and their families  and called on President Bush to move quickly in implementing the Commission recommendations in order to provide further protection from military men and women  Like the Obama McCaskill legislation  today   s successful legislation would cut Pentagon red tape  improve military medical facilities  and increase oversight at our nation   s military hospitals         This bill goes a long way toward providing our service members with the treatment and facilities they and their families need to heal and rebuild their lives     said Senator Obama     Today   s recommendations offered by the President   s Commission  which also include some of our proposals from the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act  remind us that we must do more work to ensure that our wounded warriors don   t have to wage another battle when they return home   Providing the best care for our returning service members  veterans and their families is one thing about this war we can still get right        Earlier this year when the Walter Reed scandal broke and the nation read about the unacceptable conditions our injured troops were facing when they returned home from Iraq and Afghanistan  Senator Obama and I proposed necessary changes to ensure that would never happen again  I   m pleased that today the Senate has adopted a measure that includes many of those changes     McCaskill said     Our brave young men and women sign up to fight for freedom at home and abroad  they do not sign up to have to fight for adequate medical care when they return      The bill that passed the Senate today includes several Obama McCaskill provisions such as improving living conditions at military facilities  enhancing mental health care for recovering service members  slashing red tape to ease the healing process  providing health care to family members assisting recovering service members  and reforming the broken military disability review process   The bill also adopts other Obama McCaskill legislation  the HERO Act  which would launch a major national research endeavor into the readjustment needs of returning service members  veterans and their families     Today   s service members and their families face a unique set of needs that must be identified and addressed   To provide them with the best care  comprehensive legislation should also include other provisions McCaskill and Obama have fought for  such as  Strengthen protections for service members against improper discharges for service connected mental health conditions  Provide important federal job protections for family members on invitational orders   A mother or father should never have to choose between caring for a wounded son and keeping their jobs   Require post deployment  face to face mental health screenings for all returning service members       Obama and McCaskill also noted that the Presidential Commission   s report reflects many findings the senators made last winter and subsequently incorporated into their legislation   Along with other recommendations  the Commission  created by President Bush in the aftermath of the Walter Reed scandal and co chaired by former Senator Bob Dole and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna E  Shalala  specifically seeks expanded job protections for family members who are assisting recovering service members in military hospitals   Similarly  McCaskill and Obama recently offered an amendment to the defense authorization bill to provide 12 months of job protection to these family members   Today  they said they will continue to fight for passage of this provision     Senators Obama and McCaskill first introduced this legislation in February following the revelations of extreme neglect at the Walter Reed facilities   In March  they offered key provisions of the legislation as an amendment to the Iraq Supplemental Bill  which was rejected by Senate Republicans    Senator Obama serves on the Veterans    Affairs Committee and Senator McCaskill serves on the Armed Services Committee                                    ,Obama

Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 Recent GAO reports conclude Labor Department enforcement inadequate WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today sent the following letter to Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao  expressing concerns that the Department of Labor is not fulfilling its mission to prevent and remedy violations of federal minimum wage and overtime laws   As cited in a recent editorial in the New York Times  two Government Accountability Office  GAO  reports noted serious problems at the Wage and Hour Division  WHD  of the Labor Department   One report concluded that WHD is not adequately assuring employer compliance   Another report  found an alarming lapse in the Department s handling of individual worker complaints   Despite GAO s conclusions  Acting Administrator of WHD Alexander Passantino  whose nomination is pending in the Senate  testified before the House Education and Labor Committee that GAO was categorically wrong in all of its major findings    In the letter  Obama asks Secretary Chao about Mr  Passantino s categorical rejection of GAO s findings and recommendations and how she will remedy the problems raised    The text of the letter is below    Dear Madame Secretary   I am writing to express serious concerns regarding recent reports that the U S  Department of Labor is not fulfilling its mission to prevent and remedy violations of federal minimum wage and overtime laws   It is important that the Department put procedures into place that will lead to improvements in the enforcement of workers  rights   This is the core mission of the Department and failing to adequately enforce the Fair Labor Standards Act  FLSA  is unacceptable   Most recently  two Government Accountability Office  GAO  reports shed light on serious problems at the Wage and Hour Division  WHD    One report addressed the overall effectiveness of the Division s enforcement procedures  finding that WHD is not adequately assuring employer compliance   It found that the WHD did not effectively take advantage of available information and tools in planning and conducting its compliance activities  failed to use key data on complaints and input from external groups   such as employer and worker advocacy organizations   to inform its planning process   This report also found that WHD focused on the same four industries from 1997 to 2007  despite information from its own commissioned studies that there were other low wage industries that had equally high rates of potential wage and hour violations   Finally  the GAO concluded that the agency does not sufficiently leverage its existing tools and partnerships to encourage employers to comply with the law  Another GAO report found alarming lapses in the Department s handling of individual worker complaints   GAO found frequent instances where WHD   1  inappropriately rejected complaints based on incorrect information provided by employers   2  failed to make adequate attempts to locate employers   3  did not thoroughly investigate and resolve complaints  and  4  delayed initiating investigations for excessive periods of time     Last week  Acting Administrator of WHD Alexander Passantino  whose nomination is pending in the Senate  testified before the House Education and Labor Committee that GAO was categorically wrong in all of its major findings   I would like to know whether you agree with Mr  Passantino s categorical rejection of GAO s findings and recommendations    If so  I would appreciate a detailed response explaining the basis on which you have rejected the conclusions of GAO  an independent agency whose mission is to help improve the performance and accountability of the federal government for the benefit of the American people    If in fact you disagree with Mr  Passantino  I would like you to explain specifically what steps you plan to take to address the shortcomings in the process that the report raises   GAO s conclusions about how the Department exercises its responsibilities to working Americans raise serious  but addressable  issues   Fixing these problems may require bipartisan cooperation  or in some cases additional funding  but other needed reforms are in the sole discretion of the Department  and can be instituted unilaterally     I understand that the Congressional committees of jurisdiction will be sending the Department detailed questions in conjunction with both the House hearing and Mr  Passantino s nomination   I look forward to your responses to those questions  as well as to this communication   I further hope that you will direct the Acting Administrator to revisit his recent statement and commit to reforming the Wage and Hour Division for the benefit all workers   Thank you    Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator

  Senator Obama s Office Responds to Misleading Harper s Magazine Story   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senator Obama s Office Responds to Misleading Harper s Magazine Story Monday  October 23  2006   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Tommy Vietor  202  997 3462  The latest issue of Harper s Magazine contains a piece titled  BARACK OBAMA INC  The birth of a Washington machine   The story is unfortunately filled with a selective presentation of the facts  innuendo and a cynical assumption of bad faith in our leaders  While we do not doubt the integrity or the intelligence of the piece s author  Ken Silverstein  we feel that our side of the story was not fairly presented  Below are some misleading passages from the piece  and some facts we believe will help tell the full story  Misleading Claim  1  Iraq Harper s Magazine says Obama has changed his rhetoric on Iraq  Silverstein wrote   The calibration of Obama s own political rhetoric has been particularly evident in regard to the war in Iraq   Since taking office  Obama has become far more measured in his position    page 38  Fact  Obama has been consistent   He opposed the war from the start  but decided that once we were in Iraq  we needed to plan our withdrawal carefully  Frank Rich of the New York Times puts it succinctly    On one true test for his party  Iraq   Obama  was consistent from the start  On the long trail to a hotly competitive senatorial primary in Illinois  he repeatedly questioned the rationale for the war before it began         He judged Saddam to pose no immediate threat to America and argued for containment over a war         He hasn t changed  In his new book  he gives a specific date  the end of this year  for beginning   a phased withdrawal of U S  troops           New York Times 10 23 2006     Misleading Claim  2    Favors to the Nuclear Industry Harper s Magazine implies that Obama voted to protect loan guarantees for energy technology on behalf of the nuclear industry   page 37   Fact  Obama voted with 75 other Senators to promote a wide array of innovative energy technologies  The Sununu amendment in question would have eliminated loan guarantees to encourage emerging clean energy technologies  These guarantees encouraged a wide array of renewable fuel   Besides nuclear energy  the guarantees can be used for solar and wind power  hybrid cars  hydrogen fuel cells  carbon sequestration  coal gasification and other technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions  Obama voted against the Sununu amendment because he supports emerging technologies and believes many companies would not pursue advanced research without financial support   In the end  76 senators opposed the amendment    Misleading Claim  3  Support for Other Democrats Harper s Magazine says Obama only gives funds to moderate  establishment Democrats  failing to note that Obama has donated to every Senate Democrat running for office in 2006  Harper s says  Obama s PAC has given to candidates that have been carefully culled and selected by the Democratic establishment on the basis of their marketability as palatable  moderates  even when they are facing more progressive and equally viable challengers   Harper s cites as examples Obama s political donations to Joe Lieberman over Ned Lamont  and Tammy Duckworth over Christine Cegelis   page 37  Fact  Obama donated to every Democratic Senator running for reelection and then contributed to Ned Lamont after he won the primary  Harper s takes exception to Obama s decision to donate money to Senator Lieberman  but fails to note that Obama endorsed Ned Lamont and gave him  5 000 the day after Lamont won the nomination   Obama also donated money to every Senate Democrat up for reelection and to every Democratic challenger in a closely contested Senate race  including Sherrod Brown  Claire McCaskill  Sheldon Whitehouse  and Amy Klobuchar  Harper s Magazine misrepresents Tammy Duckworth s position on Iraq  Harper s also implies that Duckworth is a pro war candidate  noting  When asked about her stand on the Iraq war by a reporter  Duckworth had replied   There is good and bad in everything     page 37 38  Duckworth  an Iraq war veteran  says on her website      Misleading Claim  4  Ethanol Harper s Magazine implies that Obama has supported ethanol production because the country s largest ethanol producer  ADM is based in Illinois  Harper s also argues that from a conservation standpoint it is potentially better to drive a standard gasoline car than a flex fuel vehicle   page 32   Fact  Senator Obama supports ethanol production because it is a clean  efficient  and domestically produced alternative to oil from the Middle East  According to the Environmental Protection Agency  E85 fuel produces fewer total toxins and lower levels of ozone forming volatile organic compounds compared to gasoline  The U S  Department of Agriculture has determined that ethanol production is efficient  creating 1 67 times the energy it takes to produce it   Argonne National Laboratory reports that by switching to ethanol and biomass fuels in our passenger cars and light duty trucks  drivers can potentially reduce the use of petroleum by at least 68 percent   Blending ethanol with gasoline just at a 10 percent level will translate to savings to consumers of  3 3 billion a year according to independent researchers at LECG  based on 2002 prices    Sources           Senator Obama wants to enable more entrepreneurs and small businesses to develop ethanol  Senator Obama supports a renewable fuels standard that would encourage ethanol production by expanding demand for renewable fuels and further diversifying the ethanol industry  thereby ensuring much greater competition in the U S  liquid fuels market in the future   Misleading Claim  5  Democratic Convention Speech Harper s Magazine suggests that Senator Obama was chosen to speak at the Democratic National Convention only after he had received the blessing of Washington lobbyists and fundraisers   If the speech was his debut to the wider American public  he had already undergone an equally successful but much quieter audition with Democratic Party leaders and fund raisers  without whose support he would surely never have had been chosen for such a prominent role at the convention    page 36  Fact  The decision to choose Senator Obama was made by Senator John Kerry s campaign  not by lobbyists  After Obama s selection as the keynote speaker at the 2004 Democratic National Convention  Senator Kerry s aides were very clear about their rationale  According to the Chicago Tribune   For the Kerry campaign  the choice of Obama has great meaning as officials try to dispel criticism that they have done a poor job of reaching out to African American voters  Kerry began to focus on Obama  the Democratic candidate for Senate in Illinois  for a role at the convention after meeting him for the first time and listening to him speak at a gala fundraiser in Chicago in April  The next day  Kerry and Obama toured the Greater West Town Community Development Project  visited a bakery  and held a town hall meeting together  An aide to Kerry said the Massachusetts senator was struck by Obama s  passion  eloquence and charisma    Chicago Tribune  July 15  2004   Misleading Claim  6  Private Jets Harper s Magazine wrongly says that Obama stopped taking privately subsidized air travel because of bad press    A fter some atypically bad press for accepting flight  Obama imposed a ban at his office on privately subsidized travel    page 40  footnote  Fact  Obama voluntarily chose to reimburse the full fare for private flights   not just the first class fare as Senate rules require   because he felt it was right  Obama voluntarily chose to reimburse full fare on private flights despite less stringent Senate rules because he thought it was the right thing to do   Obama s decision actually garnered Obama favorable press coverage   Senator Barack Obama flew at least nine times on corporate jets last year   each time  he reimbursed the plane s owners at first class rates  as Senate rules require  But Mr  Obama  freshman Democrat from Illinois  felt queasy about this perk of Senate life  so he said he gave it up   This is an example where appearances matter   he said    New York Times  March 8  2006   Misleading Claim  7  Organized Labor Harper s Magazine suggests that Obama s hiring of a former staffer for Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin makes him susceptible to policies that hurt organized labor  Harper s writes    Obama  hired Karen Kornbluh  a senior aide to Robert Rubin when the latter  as head of the Treasury Department under Bill Clinton  was a chief advocate for NAFTA and other free trade policies that decimated the nation s manufacturing sector    page 33  Fact  Obama has a strong pro labor voting record   Obama voted against the Central American Free Trade Agreement and has said that NAFTA should be renegotiated   Obama has cosponsored many important bills to help workers  including  an increase in the minimum wage  and the Employee Free Choice Act   He also championed efforts in the Senate to help air traffic controllers engaged in a labor dispute with the Federal Aviation Administration   Misleading Claim  8  Calling to Action Harper s Magazine criticizes Obama for calling on students only to strive for energy independence during a speech in July   Obama s speech contained just a single call for political action  This was when he had introduced Mark Pike  a law student who then came bounding across the state in a green one piece mechanic s outfit  As part of a campaign called  Kick the Oil Habit   Pike was to depart directly from the conference and drive from Washington to Los Angeles in a  flex fuel  vehicle   Give it up for Mark   Obama had urged the crowd  noting that Pike would be refueling only at gas stations that offer E85 which Obama touts as  a clean  renewable  and domestically produced alternative fuel     page 32  Fact  Obama was specifically asked to touch on only two themes in his speech  The group that organized the event   the Center for American Progress   specifically asked Obama to touch on two themes in his speech  1  what inspired him to go into politics  and 2  briefly the importance of energy independence    If Harper s was interested in hearing about other issues  below are speeches by Senator Obama on a

  Obama Calls on Chao to Support Sick Nuclear Weapons Employees   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama Calls on Chao to Support Sick Nuclear Weapons Employees Thursday  October 25  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao  calling on her to support former nuclear weapons workers in Illinois who have failed to receive compensation through the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  for illnesses related to their employment at nuclear waste facilities during the Cold War   For years  Cold War veterans from 29 current and former facilities in Illinois have waited to have their claims processed  and in turn have struggled with soaring health care costs   Ensuring these former employees are properly compensated has been a priority for Senator Obama   He has met with many of these workers and their families  his staff has helped victims with their claims  and he has also requested answers from agency heads   Obama also threatened to block the nominations of Administration officials until he received answers from government agencies on the lack of compensation  Recently  Secretary Chao recognized problems with EEOICPA  but failed to specify how the Department of Labor would correct them   In the letter  Obama calls on Chao to urge President Bush to improve communication within the agencies to speed up compensation  issue subpoenas to the agencies and corporations that maintain worker records  clarify current DOL policies on the EEOICPA  and meet with Illinois    former nuclear weapons employees who have been frustrated by the current process    The text of the letter is below  The Honorable Elaine Chao  Secretary  Department of Labor  Frances Perkins Building  200 Constitution Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20210 Dear Secretary Chao  I am writing regarding some recent comments you made to the Paducah Area Chamber of Commerce regarding the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA    As you know  our Cold War veterans have waited years to get their claims processed   Unfortunately  when a decision is finally made on a worker s claim  the integrity of that decision is often in doubt  I am encouraged to hear that you recognize the problems with how EEOICPA is administered   Nonetheless  what is not clear from your comments is what role you believe the Department of Labor plays in creating these problems or what you are doing to correct them   According to the Paducah Sun on October 5  2007         We recognize there have been problems with this program      Chao  said at Thursday   s Paducah Area Chamber of Commerce breakfast   Chao said her staff has urged other agencies    especially the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health    to quickly address the concerns to help people get paid more quickly      And for many of these families time is running out     Chao said       I agree with you that time is running out for many of these workers   Every few weeks  I hear about another Illinois nuclear worker who has passed away without having his or her claim resolved   What I am concerned about  however is that your comments seem to place the blame for this program   s problems at the feet of every other agency  except the Department of Labor  DOL    To be sure  the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  as well as the Department of Energy  share responsibility for EEOICPA   s problems   But a great deal of responsibility for the proper administration of this program rests with DOL  and I am troubled that your comments do not recognize that fact   If DOL is serious about helping nuclear workers under EEOICPA  there are a number of actions that you could take that would be of great value  1   Urge the President to provide the proper balance of worker  medical  and scientific perspectives on the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health by appointing board members who represent the interests of workers or the medical community   2   Issue subpoenas to the corporations and government agencies that maintain the records for the work they did to develop our nation   s nuclear weapons   To date  DOL has issued only one subpoena  3   Provide a written response to the following  a   Does the Department of Labor consider worker affidavits to be true if there is no documentation to establish that their testimony is false  b  What policy  statute or regulation does the Department of Labor use when evaluating the weight to give worker testimony when making decisions related to EEOICPA claims and or SEC petitions              4   Meet with Illinois    former nuclear weapons workers who have found this compensation program administered by the Department of Labor to be so frustrating   Specifically  workers of the former Dow Chemical site in Madison  IL have waited nearly seven years for a decision on their claim   To date  only two have gone through the process of dose reconstruction   I believe you would find it valuable to speak directly with these workers and their survivors and hear first hand about the ongoing frustrations they have with this program   Should you be willing to meet with these workers  I would be happy to arrange the meeting at your earliest convenience    Thank you for your consideration to this request  Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator                                   ,Obama

Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent President Bush the following letter  calling on him to immediately compile and release information on the total number of security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan  the total cost of the contracts  and the number of contractors killed or wounded   With an estimated 48 000 private security employees operating in Iraq  and more than 1 000 contractors killed since 2003  little is known about what functions these security contractors are performing  how much their services are costing  and what rules of engagement they are following    Last week  Obama filed an amendment to the FY 2008 Defense Authorization bill  which requires federal agencies to compile and report information on security contractors to Congress   Obama originally offered the Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act  S  674  in February  The text of the letter is below  Dear Mr  President  I am writing to express my concern about the lack of transparency and accountability in the U S  government   s use of private security contractors in Iraq   I was disturbed by recent press accounts describing a firefight in which Blackwater USA security contractors killed at least 9 people and wounded many others   This recent incident  which is under investigation by the Department of State  raises larger questions about the role of private security contractors and the impact their use has on our military efforts in Iraq    Little is known about what functions these security contractors are performing  how much their services are costing  and what rules of engagement they are following   Moreover  according to press accounts  Blackwater has been exempt from military regulations governing other security companies  such as restrictions on the use of offensive weapons  requirements to report shooting incidents  and compliance with a central tracking system that allows commanders to monitor the movements of security companies on the battlefield   In February  I introduced the Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act  S  674    This legislation would require federal agencies to report to Congress on   the total number of security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan  the total cost of the contractors  the number of contractors killed or wounded  information about the military and safety equipment provided to contractors  and a description of disciplinary action taken against contractors   The bill also would improve coordination between security contractors and U S  armed forces by requiring the issuance of rules of engagement  clarify the legal status of contractors  and require investigation of criminal misconduct committed by contractors     I have offered an amendment that includes several provisions drawn from S  674 to the FY 2008 Defense Authorization bill  which is currently before the Senate  and similar provisions have been included in the House version of the bill    With tens of thousands of private security employees operating in Iraq  and more than 1 000 contractors killed since 2003  the U S  government should immediately compile and release this critical information required by my legislation   The American people deserve to know how their taxpayer dollars are being spent abroad  whether American civilian contractors are adequately protected  and whether these contractors are abiding by American law  Accordingly  I request that you direct the appropriate federal agencies to compile the following information about private security contracts and provide it to Congress in a timely fashion    1  The number of persons performing private security work in Iraq and Afghanistan under contracts entered into by federal departments and agencies  including the Department of Defense  the Department of State  the Department of the Interior  the United States Agency for International Development  and the elements of the intelligence community  respectively   2  The companies awarded such contracts and subcontracts   3  The total cost of such contracts   4  The total number of persons who have been killed or wounded performing work under such contracts   5  A description of the military equipment and safety equipment provided for the protection of contractors under such contracts  and an assessment of the adequacy of such equipment   6  The policies and procedures through which federal departments and agencies instruct and inform contractors of the applicability of the laws of the United States  Iraq  and Afghanistan to their activities   7  The policies and procedures through which federal departments and agencies monitor contractors on their adherence to the laws of the United States  Iraq  and Afghanistan   8  The laws  if any  determined to have been broken in the performance of such contracts  including laws of the United States  Iraq  and Afghanistan  and  9  A description of the disciplinary actions that have been taken against persons performing work under such contracts by either the contractor concerned or the governments of the United States  Iraq  and Afghanistan  It is our government   s obligation to ensure that security contractors in Iraq are subject to adequate and transparent oversight and that their actions do not have a negative impact on our military   s efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan   Please let me know by October 1  2007  whether you will agree to provide this information  Thank you    Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator                                    ,Obama

RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 Bureaucratic red tape has delayed first responder reconstruction projects after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to FEMA Administrator David Paulison  raising concerns about ongoing reconstruction delays  funding disparities  and bureaucratic red tape for first responder resources and projects in New Orleans   Since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the Gulf Coast  and levee failures left the City of New Orleans under water  most of the City s municipal infrastructure was destroyed  especially its emergency response infrastructure  In the letter  Obama calls on FEMA to expedite  comprehensive damage assessments  for the emergency responder facilities so they can begin the rebuilding process  address the funding gap between the obligated funds and the estimated repair costs for the new criminal justice facility  and cut the needless red tape slowing down the reconstruction process   The City of New Orleans has also called on FEMA to swiftly address these concerns    Obama serves as a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  and has been actively involved in helping Gulf Coast residents recover and rebuild since these hurricanes struck    The text of the letter is below  Dear Mr  Paulison  I am writing to express my concerns regarding several issues confronting the City of New Orleans   the City   as it continues to rebuild after the levee failure during Hurricane Katrina  As the City shared with you in a recent letter  there are several top Public Assistance projects and other concerns that must be addressed and I urge FEMA to act quickly on the issues identified by the City  including   Police and Fire Fighter Station Repair   I ask that you address the continued delay in conducting  comprehensive damage assessments  for the Police and Fire Department stations and substations in the City of New Orleans   Without these damage assessments  full repair of the facilities is impossible   While reports indicate that roof repair and stabilization is underway  I urge you to expedite the damage assessments necessary to provide full rehabilitation of these stations  As you conduct these damage assessments  it is likely that cost adjustments may be necessary   I hope FEMA will work with the City of New Orleans and its emergency responders to ensure that the necessary cost adjustments are made in a timely fashion order to ensure that the City is provided adequate funds for these important improvements  Combined Criminal Facility   I ask that FEMA address the funding gap between the obligated funds for the new combined criminal justice facility and the estimated repair costs   As the City struggles with increasing crime problems  the City must have a top quality  fully functioning criminal justice facility and the proposed project will greatly enhance the city s ability to respond to the challenging crime problem    Cutting Red Tape   As the City has outlined in its correspondence with you  the delayed processing of appeals and determinations of damage percentages is hindering the recovery process   I urge you to work to cut the red tape needlessly slowing down the reconstruction process   The proposed 30 day time frame for resolving these issues seems reasonable and I believe will greatly enhance the reconstruction that is still so sorely needed in the City    As you well know  our nation s emergency responders are our front lines in the face of disaster   Now  over two years after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita struck and devastated the Gulf Coast and levee failures left the City of New Orleans under water  it is imperative that we guarantee the people of New Orleans swift repair of its municipal infrastructure  especially its emergency response infrastructure     I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your response to these concerns in the next two weeks  Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator                                 Pursuant to  policy

LaBolt  Obama   Adrianne Marsh  McCaskill   Jennifer Mullin  Harkin   Vince Morris  Kerry   Sara Kuban  Baucus   Elizabeth Alexander  Biden           Legislation would provide family members up to one year of job safety   as they care for wounded heroes WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  was today joined by Senators Claire McCaskill  D MO   Tom Harkin  D IA   John Kerry  D MA   Max Baucus  D MT  and Joseph R  Biden  Jr   D DE  to introduce legislation that would provide up to a full year of job protections for any family member who is caring for a recovering service member at a military medical facility    Obama  McCaskill  and Harkin last introduced this legislation as an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Act   This measure     called the Military Family Job Protection Act   would help ensure that military families will not be forced to wonder whether their job will still be there when they get back home and ease the burden on service members who must focus on their own recovery   This approach was endorsed yesterday by the President   s Commission       When America   s sons and daughters are injured overseas and they return home to begin their recovery  their families should not be forced to choose between caring for a wounded child or keeping their jobs     said Senator Obama      This legislation would provide a safety net that allows families to offer the care that   s necessary for our wounded heroes  easing the burden on the service members   Providing our service members and their families with the care and compassion they deserve is one thing we can still get right about this war        Family members should not have to choose between their livelihoods and caring for wounded loved ones and our bill would remove that burden     Senator McCaskill said     Our military families make tremendous sacrifices to ensure our men and women in uniform can protect our nation     said Senator Harkin     We must do all we can to protect them as well  This bill would prevent job discrimination and ensure families of service members have peace of mind when they are caring for a wounded loved one  I am proud to support this bill that will ensure the families who support our wounded service members have one less challenge to overcome        We must support our military families by giving them the time they need to care for their loved ones     our heroes who serve this country     Senator Kerry said     Extending the amount of time they can take leave to care for a wounded loved one is the very least we can do to honor their service  The last thing our military families should worry about is whether they are also going to lose their jobs as they care for those who have so honorably served this country        When our brave men and women serving in uniform are wounded  their families should be focused on helping them recover  not worrying about where their next paycheck is going to come from     Senator Baucus said     And this legislation will help ease some of the pain along the road to recovery      We must ensure that family members of our wounded warriors are not forced to choose between providing care for their loved ones or keeping their jobs     said Senator Biden      The emotional support these family members give their loved ones  along with the personal  medical and convalescent care they provide  is invaluable and goes a long way in a wounded soldier s recovery   Many families that are already experiencing financial strains due to the deployment of a loved one face additional financial and employment pressures when that service member returns with severe injuries   It is not uncommon for a severely injured service member to spend months recovering at facilities like Walter Reed   There are cases in which family members have had to choose between caring for a loved one and keeping their jobs   Under the Family Medical Leave Act  FMLA   a family member may only receive 12 covered weeks of leave in a given year to care for a seriously ill family member    This legislation will provide employment protections for family members who are carrying for members of the Armed Forces recovering from illnesses and injuries incurred on active duty for up to one year  The bill is based on a provision in the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act  S  713  that was introduced in February by Senators Obama and McCaskill and has 34 bipartisan cosponsors                                     ,Obama

 and emergency services WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced the Improving Emergency Medical Care and Response Act of 2007  which would provide funding for programs that would enhance emergency care systems throughout the country   Recent reports indicate that our nation   s emergency medical care system is not yet equipped to take on new challenges we could face in the coming years   Through multi year grants in regions across the U S   this legislation would better coordinate public health  safety  and emergency services  streamline emergency communications and organize medical data and information to better serve the public     Our nation   s emergency departments are overburdened and ill equipped to respond to the public health crises we must be prepared to face     said Senator Obama      This bill will ensure our emergency rooms  medical personnel and response teams have streamlined communications systems  real time data  and other coordination tools   We will face unprecedented challenges in the years to come  and we need to equip our emergency departments to prepare for the unexpected     In 2006  the Institute of Medicine  IOM  published a series of reports titled the Future of Emergency Care   The reports concluded that in many places throughout the nation  emergency medical services  EMS  are highly fragmented  poorly equipped  and insufficiently prepared for day to day operations  let alone major disasters   Furthermore  emergency departments  EDs  are increasingly overburdened   Between 1993 and 2003  the nationwide number of EDs declined by 425 while the number of emergency visits rose by more than 25 percent   from 90 300 000 to almost 114 000 000   ED overcrowding  which can lead to ambulance diversion  flawed coordination between emergency medical services and EDs  poor communication with public health departments  and lack of disaster preparedness are among the areas that need thoughtful improvement    Notably  the American College of Emergency Physicians  ACEP  agreed with the IOM findings  giving emergency care in the U S  a national grade of C    in its 2006    National Report Card on the State of Emergency Medicine      The Improving Emergency Medical Care and Response Act of 2007 Regionalized accountable emergency care systems show substantial promise in addressing the complexity of an efficient EMS response  which must properly manage the coordination of a number of groups  agencies  and individuals involved   from incident recognition to providing specialized care to public education   This legislation would support 4 multi year grants to support demonstration programs aimed at designing  implementing  and evaluating a regionalized  accountable emergency care

is uniquely defined by the urgency and location of treatment rather than specific organ systems or conditions   This has proven a challenge for funding in emergency medical research because of the broad scope of clinical disciplines it covers   In 2003  only 0 05 percent of NIH training grants awarded to medical schools went to EDs  compared to 29 percent for internal medicine   This Act establishes support for emergency medical research through various Federal agencies in order to expand and accelerate our understanding of the basic science of emergency medicine and enhancing patient outcomes through improved medical service delivery  This legislation is supported by the American College of Surgeons  the American College of Emergency Physicians  and Advocates for EMS    Senator

Chris Murphy  CT 5   Mark Souder  IN 3  House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Henry Waxman  CA 30   Subcommittee on Government Management  Organization  and Procurement Chairman Ed Towns  NY 10   Subcommittee on Information Policy  Census  and National Archives Chairman Wm  Lacy Clay  D MO 1   Virginia Foxx  NC 5   and John Shadegg  AZ 3  introduced bipartisan legislation to make it easier for the public to find out how their tax dollars are being spent    Currently  USASpending gov acts as a clearing house for this information  this legislation would expand the information available on the web site  as well as make the data more accessible and readable   The Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008  also known as the  Google for Government  Act  is identical to a bill introduced in the Senate by Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma  with the support of Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Tom Carper of Delaware   In the past year and half  we ve opened up the books on how the Congress does business   This bill makes it even easier for taxpayers to see how their government is operating   said Representative Murphy   Government transparency is fundamental to our democracy  and I am pleased to cosponsor this bipartisan legislation  which will enhance the amount  and type  of information available to the American public   Simply put  this bill would make the federal government more accountable   said Representative Souder  Updating USASpending gov would allow visitors to view copies of Federal contracts  as well as information about competitive bidding  government lease agreements  earmarks  Federal audit disputes  work quality  Federal tax compliance  any violations or criminal activities  and government reports   USASpending gov was launched in December 2007   It currently allows taxpayers to view approximately  1 trillion in Federal grants  contracts  earmarks  provides updates of data concerning Federal spending  and displays spending data according to contractor  grantee  and congressional district     Our government took an important step last year by launching USASpending gov and giving ordinary citizens an important tool to hold Washington accountable for its spending   said Senator Obama    While USASpending gov has had tremendous success  we can make it even more accessible by expanding the information available on the website and improving the quality of government financial data   I commend my colleagues in the House for offering bipartisan companion legislation  and I look forward to Congress passing this legislation soon    In our system of government  the best ethics reform has always been frequent elections and the ability of citizens to hold their elected officials accountable   This legislation will give the American people valuable new tools in that effort   said Senator Coburn   This bill continues our work to bring more sunshine to where taxpayer dollars go   I am happy to join Senators Obama and Coburn in boosting oversight of contractors   said Chairman Towns   Taxpayers deserve full accountability and easy access to see how their money is spent   This bill makes tracking federal spending easier  more complete and more accurate   said Chairman Clay   Strengthening government accountability and ensuring that average taxpayers can access up to date information on government spending is just plain common sense   Throwing open the doors of government to the sunshine of public access and accountability will make government more responsive to the American citizenry and this legislation advances that critical goal   said Representative Foxx   The American people have a right to know how we re spending their money   This legislation is a first and important step to improving fiscal accountability in the federal government   The more accountable our government becomes  the less it will waste   said Representative Shadegg                                Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot

                Obama Introduces Comprehensive Bill to Strengthen Nation   s Middle Schools Friday  October 26  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  Obama   Chip Unruh  Reed   or Natalie Luna  Grijalva    WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today was joined by Senator Jack Reed  D RI  in introducing the Success in the Middle Act  which would authorize grants to states and school districts to improve low performing middle schools  help raise student achievement  and support our teachers   Representative Ra  l Grijalva  D AZ  has introduced a companion bill in the House   This bill would provide additional federal support to help students successfully complete the middle grades and turn under performing middle schools around     For far too long  our education system has overlooked our nation   s middle schools  and failed to provide them the resources they need for our kids to succeed     said Senator Obama      The middle school experience is vital to success in high school and college  and the lack of attention to middle school on a federal level is reflected in the rising high school dropout rate   Like cities across the country  Chicago has seen only 54  of students graduate from high school by the age of 19   We need to do more to invest in these schools  and this legislation will invest in a new generation of leaders by strengthening our middle schools  teachers  and students   If our country wants to remain competitive in math and science on a global level  we must break down any barriers that are preventing our kids from getting the world class education they deserve        Middle school is a critical time in a student   s educational and social development   It is important to reach at risk students early  before they experience a decline in grades and attendance   Research shows that sixth graders who do not attend school regularly or fail math and English are likely to drop out before graduating from high school     said Senator Reed  a member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee      This legislation will help reform our nation   s middle schools and provide increased support and training for middle school teachers   By targeting additional resources to these grades we will help our children reach their full potential and successfully transition to high school  college  and the workforce        I am very grateful to Senator Obama for initiating the Middle School Bill in the Senate   Middle Schools have long been a forgotten area in our school system     said Congressman Grijalva      This legislation will reverse this pattern and invest in the most crucial years of the education pipeline to ensure our students succeed     The middle school years are a time when academic achievement for U S  students falls dramatically  Minority and low income students are disproportionately affected by underinvestment in middle schools  International math and science comparisons indicate that students in the U S  do not start out behind students in other countries  but they do lag by the end of the middle grades   Many sixth grade students in urban  high poverty schools might attend school sporadically  might be suspended  or fail classes   Research shows that sixth graders with these indicators can account for 40 50  of eventual high school dropouts  and two thirds of the students who will be moved out of their homes and into the juvenile justice system   Since middle schools are more likely than elementary schools or high schools to be identified for improvement  we must identify and address these problems immediately    The Success in the Middle Act would authorize grants to states and school districts to improve low performing middle schools  States would use research findings and promising practices  and work with community partners  such as universities and non profits  to develop plans to improve middle school student achievement   Schools would use early identification data systems to focus on those students most at risk  and to determine how best to teach and support them  Funds would also be authorized to perform research on effective practices to support student learning  and on effective instruction for the middle grades   Specifically  this Act would  Authorize  1 billion a year to states to provide competitive grants to local school districts to improve low performing schools that contain middle grades  Using research findings and promising practices  states would develop detailed plans to improve middle school student achievement   Comprehensive centers  universities  and non profits  would provide technical assistance to the states in developing these plans   Develop and utilize early identification data systems to identify those students most at risk of subsequently dropping out  and to assist school districts in providing targeted interventions to help all middle grades students succeed  Invest in effective strategies at the state and district level such as providing professional development and coaching to school leaders  and developing and implementing comprehensive  school wide improvement efforts and implementing student supports  Authorize funds to generate and disseminate the results of research to identify and employ effective practices that support student learning and success at the middle level   This legislation is supported by the National Education Association  National Association of Secondary School Principals  National Middle School Association  Alliance for Excellent Education  ACT  College Board  Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund  International Reading Association  Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development  National Council of

Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today praised the decision by President Bush to declare six Illinois counties     DeKalb  Grundy  Kane  LaSalle  Lake and Will     federal disaster areas  The President   s disaster declaration triggers the release of federal funds to help people and municipalities recover from severe storms and flooding which occurred in that area August 20     August 31  2007   The President   s declaration includes the possibility that additional designations may be made at a later date after further evaluation     Although the power is back on  and the flooding is long gone  residents and business owners are still facing a mountain of challenges  This Presidential disaster declaration will now start the process of matching needs with money     said Durbin     There is a tremendous amount of work ahead of us  Damage estimates show that nearly 70 homes were destroyed and another 160 homes received major damage  I am hopeful that the federal restoration efforts will begin dealing with the most seriously affected residents first          The families and businesses in our communities affected by the floods this summer deserve our assistance in rebuilding     Senator Obama said      The Delegation pulled together quickly to make sure this request was granted and residents of the six affected counties will get the help they need  I will work to ensure the funds are allocated quickly for all affected Illinoisans       Durbin and Obama noted that federal disaster assistance falls into three general categories   Individual Assistance  Public Assistance and Hazard Mitigation Assistance   DeKalb  Grundy  Kane  LaSalle  Lake and Will Counties are designated for Individual Assistance which provides assistance for individuals and households   This can include cash grants to help with temporary housing  home repairs and replacement  medical and other disaster related costs   DeKalb  Kane and LaSalle Counties are designated for Public Assistance which provides assistance to local and state governments for extraordinary costs for response and recovery to the disaster   This can include emergency work  debris removal from public roads and repair and replacement of disaster damaged public facilities or infrastructure   Additionally  all Illinois counties have been designated for Hazard Mitigation Assistance which includes funding for measures designed to reduce future losses to public and private property  The U S  Small Business Administration can  also  make low interest loans  available for repairing  or replacing  homes  personal property or businesses that sustained damages not covered by insurance     Of the nearly 70 homes that were destroyed in a nine county area 62 were in DeKalb County and six in LaSalle County   In addition to the 160 other homes in the area that received major damage  nearly 4 800 other homes received lesser damage   In addition  169 businesses in the area suffered damage  including six businesses that suffered major damage   The assessment teams also determined that it will cost local and state government agencies almost  23 million to respond to the flooding and severe storms   The Illinois Emergency Management Agency is coordinating the state   s response   On September 14  members of the Illinois Congressional Delegation asked President Bush to declare nine Illinois counties federal disaster areas after severe flooding storms hit the area earlier this month   The affected counties in northeastern Illinois included  Cook  DeKalb  DuPage  Grundy  Kane  Lake  LaSalle  McHenry  and Will    Members who signed on to the letter in addition to Senators Durbin and Obama include  Representatives Judy Biggert  R IL   Dennis Hastert  R IL   Don Manzullo  R IL   Peter Roskam  R IL   Bobby Rush  D IL   Jesse Jackson  Jr   D IL   Dan Lipinski  D IL   Rahm Emanuel  D IL   Danny Davis  D IL   Melissa Bean  D IL   Jan Schakowsky  D IL  and Mark Kirk  R IL    The Illinois lawmakers made their request in a letter to the President in support of Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich   s request earlier that day for federal disaster assistance

Immediate Release   Contact  Sandra Abrevaya  Durbin  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner urging France to reconsider its decision not to extradite Hans Peterson  an American citizen who reportedly confessed to the 2006 murder of Dr  David Cornbleet in Chicago  Earlier this month  Peterson turned himself in to French authorities and confessed to the brutal murder of Dr  Cornbleet  a Chicago dermatologist   Peterson is currently in French custody in Guadeloupe   According to reports  Peterson  whose mother is French  fled to French territory after allegedly committing the murder in an effort to avoid criminal prosecution in the United States   The U S  Department of Justice Office of International Affairs has issued a formal request to the Government of France for Peterson s extradition   On August 23  France announced their decision not to extradite Peterson  Last week  Durbin and Obama sent a letter to Charg   d Affaires Fran  ois Rivasseau at the French Embassy in Washington  DC  urging the Government of France to agree to the United States  request for Peterson   s extradition to face criminal prosecution Dr  Cornbleet   s murder   The Illinois Senators also sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  requesting that she immediately urge her French counterparts to examine the extradition request and to advise the U S  Embassy in Paris of the importance of this case  August 24  2007  The Honorable M  Bernard Kouchner   Foreign Minister  Ministry of Foreign Affairs   37  Quai d Orsay   F   75351 PARIS  Dear Mr  Minister   Congratulations on your appointment as Foreign Minister   You have had an impressive career pre dating this assignment  and your strong efforts have continued in your first months in this new position   We are writing in relation to an issue of great importance to Americans in my state of Illinois and of intense personal interest to us  the criminal investigation into the murder of Dr  David Cornbleet   Dr  Cornbleet  an American citizen in Chicago  Illinois  was brutally stabbed to death on October 24  2006   It is our understanding that Mr  Hans Peterson  also an American citizen  has confessed to the murder of Dr  Cornbleet  and is currently in the custody of French authorities in Guadeloupe   The United States Department of Justice Office of International Affairs has issued a formal request to the Government of France for the extradition of Hans Peterson to face criminal prosecution for Dr  Cornbleet s murder   We wrote earlier this week to the French Charg   d   Affaires in Washington  Fran  ois Rivasseau  underscoring our strong support for this extradition request   However  we learned from a letter from the Ministry of Justice to the U S  Department of Justice on August 22  as well as from a response to our letter that we received today from Charg   d   Affaires Rivasseau  that the Ministry of Justice considers the American born  U S  citizen Peterson to also be a French national and that the extradition request has been denied   These communications    which cite Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France as the primary basis for the decision not to extradite   are a blow to the Cornbleet family and to all Illinoisans    Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in pertinent part that    There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State      While this Article does not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state  it also does not appear to preclude extradition   To the extent there is discretion available in such extradition decisions  we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in favor of extradition   We believe the specific facts of this case justify Mr  Peterson   s extradition   As you may know  after Dr  Cornbleet s death  Mr  Peterson traveled to St  Martin in the French West Indies   In May 2007  Mr  Peterson sought and obtained a French passport after Mr  Peterson s American former roommates contacted the Chicago Police Department to report their suspicions that Peterson was involved in Dr  Cornbleet s murder   In June 2007  the State s Attorney s Office in Cook County  Illinois  confirmed that Mr  Peterson   s DNA was found at the crime scene and issued a warrant for Mr  Peterson s arrest   In August 2007  Mr  Peterson turned himself in to French authorities in St  Martin and allegedly confessed to murdering Dr  Cornbleet      After apparently living his entire life in the United States and under the protection of U S  laws  it appears that Mr  Peterson committed a heinous crime  fled the United States for French territory  and then asserted a claim to French citizenship in an attempt to avoid criminal prosecution in the United States   Dr  Cornbleet s family  the people of Illinois  and the United States criminal justice system have a strong and compelling interest in seeing Mr  Peterson face trial in the United States   We strongly urge the Government of France to reconsider its decision to deny the extradition request for Mr  Peterson and to allow him to face charges in the nation where the crime he confessed to was committed    We ask you for the favor of a swift response    Sincerely     Barack Obama    U S  Senator   Richard J  Durbin  U S  Senator

         Obama  McCaskill Initiative Would Improve Treatment for Servicemembers Tuesday  March 27  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Ben LaBolt  Amendment would ensure soldiers are cared for after they return home from war WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Claire McCaskill  D MO  were today joined by Senators Kerry  D MA   Cantwell  D WA   Biden  D DE   Harkin  D IA   Mikulski  D MD   and Bingaman  D NM  in introducing an amendment to the Iraq supplemental bill that would improve care for servicemembers at active duty military hospitals by adding caseworkers and mental health counselors  reducing bureaucratic hurdles  establishing a women   s mental health treatment program and providing a comprehensive mental health study to ensure that the needs of returning soldiers are met   The amendment is based on S  713  the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act  which Obama and McCaskill in February  Key provisions of the amendment are  More Caseworkers     The Post series found that servicemembers waited on average 209 days to get their disability paperwork processed because caseworkers were overwhelmed by the large number of patients   During this period of limbo  servicemembers have no idea whether they   re going to remain on active duty  whether they   re going to be discharged and  if so  how much they will receive in benefits   In order to speed up the processing of paperwork  the amendment provides  41 million to hire 10 additional caseworkers at each of the 75 military hospitals  More Mental Health and Crisis Counselors     The Post series found that many servicemembers had insufficient access to counselors to help them with psychological problems resulting from their combat service and injuries   Nor did families of servicemembers have access to counselors to help them cope with the challenges and stresses they would face   The amendment provides  17 million to hire 4 additional caseworkers at each of the 75 military hospitals   Electronic Submission of Paperwork     Recovering servicemembers are forced to navigate a confusing DOD bureaucracy that requires them to submit numerous documents to different offices  which often lose the documents   To address this problem  the amendment provides  30 million for the Armed Forces to develop a new secure system to allow recovering servicemembers to submit required paperwork on the Internet and to allow the Armed Forces to track and review paperwork on the Internet  Women   s Mental Health Treatment Program     A recent New York Times Magazine story found that women soldiers face particular mental health issues  particularly given the high number of women soldiers who are the victims of sexual assault and harassment   The amendment provides  15 million for DOD to develop a women s mental health treatment program  including the hiring and training of sexual abuse counselors  to assist female servicemembers who have experienced post traumatic stress disorder or sexual assault and abuse   Comprehensive Study of Mental Health Needs     Following the Vietnam War  a comprehensive study of the mental health needs of returning soldiers was not conducted until 1983     15 years after the height of the war   That is too late   This amendment requires the National Academy of Sciences to study the mental health needs of returning Iraq and Afghanistan servicemembers based on the landmark 1983 National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study   Senator Obama   s remarks on the amendment are below  Towards the end of World War II  Norman Rockwell created a cover for the Saturday Evening Post titled     Homecoming G I       It is a picture of a soldier returning from war   He has a duffle bag clutched in his left hand   He   s looking up at the back of a brick building with laundry hanging from the back porch   A woman in an apron sees him with outstretched arms and a young child races down the stairs   Everyone sees that soldier     the neighbor   s kids  the man fixing the roof  faces from another window     and everyone welcomes that soldier who   s come home from war   That is what our nation did for the millions of service members who returned from the Atlantic and the Pacific   We watched them come home in waves  some were just as strong as their first day in battle  others limped   We saw them crowd Times Square   We saw them walk down Main Streets and sit on stoops   And my grandfather  who fought in Patton   s army  would often speak about this time as America at its finest   That Homecoming didn   t just happen  we were ready for it   Long before the beaches of Normandy were stormed and the last battle was fought  in 1943  President Roosevelt said         Among many other things we are  today  laying plans for the return to civilian life of our gallant men and women in the armed services  They must not be demobilized into an environment of inflation and unemployment  to a place on a bread line  or on a corner selling apples  We must  this time  have plans ready     instead of waiting to do a hasty  inefficient  and ill considered job at the last moment      These are words of wisdom that we ignore at our peril   Today  we have more than 631 000 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan and other parts of the Global War on Terror   According to a recent VA health care report  one third   more than 205 000   have sought treatment at VA health facilities   Even if the war in Iraq comes to an end soon     and I hope the Senate takes action this week to accomplish that goal     the war will live on with our service members and their families for the rest of our lives   Unfortunately  over the past month  we have all seen the disturbing pictures of neglect at Walter Reed   We have read about bats and bureaucratic red tape at the VA   We have seen too many stories about our veterans who have been forgotten   not greeted by the nation that asked them to serve   The time has come for us to see this generation of veterans in all their valor and pain   We should provide them with a plan that is worthy of their courage and will help build back the military they love   That is what Senator McCaskill and I are trying to do with the amendment we offer today   First  we provide an additional  41 million to hire more caseworkers to assist service members navigating the military   s bureaucracy   The last thing a wounded service member should have to face when they return home is a frontline of paper work and delay   Right now  the caseworker to service member ratio at Walter Reed is 1 to 50   Caseworkers help recovering soldiers schedule appointments  care for their everyday needs  and help them fill out paperwork   Military caseworkers are overwhelmed   I understand that the Army is reducing the caseworker to service member ratio to 1 in 17   I applaud this move and our amendment would help the military achieve this goal at all military hospitals   Our amendment also provides  30 million for the armed forces to create an Internet based system for service members to submit their paperwork electronically   No longer will amputees and servicemembers in wheelchairs have to go to countless offices to fill out duplicative forms  only to learn that the forms have been lost in the government bureaucracy   We also need to do more to increase the number of mental health crisis counselors available to assist recovering service members and their families   Too many service members are returning home with unmet mental health needs     stresses that are often experienced by their family members   That   s why our amendment provides  17 million for more mental health crisis counselors   While we all praise how our country treated the service members returning from World War II  we must remember the lessons after Vietnam   The landmark National Vietnam Veterans    Readjustment Study was congressionally mandated in 1983  fifteen years after the height of that war   The completed report showed that the vast majority of Vietnam veterans had successfully acclimated to post war life   We can   t wait fifteen years to plan and prepare for the readjustment needs of the service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan   The average age of a service member deployed since September 11th is 27   The average age of our Guard and Reservists is 33   Sixty percent of those deployed have family responsibilities     47 percent of those who have died have left families   160 000 women have been deployed  and ten percent of those women are single mothers   These men and women are going to face real challenges in readjusting to normal life   Our amendment would provide for a study by the National Academy of Sciences of the mental health and readjustment needs of returning service members   This study will assist the Department of Defense  VA  and Congress in planning for the long term needs of our veterans  Mr  President  last week  I met a woman at Walter Reed   She is one of the 160 000 women who have been deployed  and she suffers from post traumatic stress disorder   Most of us associate PTSD with men and combat   But many of the women in theater face first hand dangers in their combat support roles   Driving a truck in Baghdad is one of the most dangerous missions around     and that is a support role   Women are witnessing the horrors of improvised explosive devices and the horrors of losing fellow service members   And too many experience the trauma of sexual abuse   This young woman was very scared and she trembled as we spoke   I asked what we could do to help   She said that she could not handle group therapy sessions  she could only tolerate one on one sessions with counselors   Her experience is shared by many women   Treatment for women with PTSD  especially sexual abuse victims  is very different from treatment for men   That is why today  we want to provide  15 million to address the unique mental health needs of women   This funding will ensure the development and implementation of a women   s treatment program for mental health conditions  including PTSD   It will also include the hiring and training of sexual abuse counselors  so that the service members who suffer from this trauma do not have to suffer in silence   We can do this for the woman I met at Walter Reed and the thousands who suffer like her   The total cost of our amendment is  103 million     less than one tenth of one percent the total cost of this bill   That   s the least we can do for our service members and their families                                   ,Obama

or David Gillies  Costello  Senators ask for explanation of ABI investigation delay  WASHINGTON  D C    Two weeks after the Veterans Affairs Medical Center  VAMC  in Marion  Illinois resumed outpatient surgeries  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  and Representative Jerry Costello  D IL  today requested a meeting with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  James Peake  to discuss the progress at the Marion facility   The Senators are asking for an update on the status of a pending Administrative Board of Investigation  ABI  report at the Marion facility to determine which individuals were responsible for allowing a decline in the quality of patient care  including nine deaths as a result of substandard care    As surgical procedures restart in Marion  it is important that we continue to work toward returning the VAMC to a full service medical facility   said Durbin    This can not be done before the conclusion of the ABI report and without a permanent leadership team in place   I expect the VA to make every effort to finish this report and implement the recommendations as soon as possible    Our nation s veterans should expect nothing less than the best care and treatment at veterans  facilities in Illinois and throughout the United States   said Obama   After last year s unacceptable tragedies at the Marion VA  we must do everything we can to guarantee that the VA maintains the highest standards for its medical personnel and operations  Our veterans must not be put in danger when they are seeking help  I am committed to working with Senator Durbin  my Illinois colleagues  and Secretary Peake to ensure this facility is once again capable of providing our veterans with the quality medical attention they deserve    While some progress is being made at Marion  there are still many questions that need to be answered   said Costello    A full public accounting of the problems at the facility needs to be made by the VA in order to move forward   In a February 19  2008 letter  Secretary Peake informed Senator Durbin that the ABI was interviewing VA employees and would complete its final report in April   Despite multiple inquires into the status of the ABI s final report no revised completion date has been offered   On May 8  the VAMC facility in Marion  Illinois resumed low risk  outpatient surgeries that

810 Vermont Ave   NW  Washington  DC 20420 Dear Secretary Peake  We are writing to urge the completion and release of the pending investigation at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center  VAMC  in Marion  Illinois  and request a meeting with you to discuss the situation there  For many years  veterans from Illinois  Indiana  and Kentucky have given high grades to the Marion VAMC   The men and women who work at the hospital today are committed to continuing to provide high quality care for our veterans  Unfortunately  poor leadership and communication led to serious problems at the facility last year  including surgical malfeasance associated with the deaths of nine veterans   The Veterans Administration  VA  reassigned five individuals  including the VAMC director  chief of staff  and chief of surgery  to non clinical areas after concerns about the quality of patient care at the facility arose in 2007  The reassignments became effective as early as September 14 of last year   After a three month delay  the VA convened an Administrative Board of Investigation  ABI  to determine which individuals at the Marion VAMC were responsible for allowing these serious problems to continue  In a February 19  2008 letter  you informed Senator Durbin that the ABI was interviewing VA employees and would complete its final report in April   That date has passed   Our staff has contacted your office on multiple occasions to inquire into the status of the ABI s final report   Your office has been unable to offer a completion date  We are also concerned that veterans are being asked to travel for surgical operations that once were available to them in Marion   While we are pleased that the VAMC resumed minor outpatient surgeries on May 8  we are looking for more information from you on the plans for returning the Marion VAMC to a full service medical facility  We request a meeting with you at your earliest availability to discuss the completion of the ABI report  the progress in

Officials to Discuss the Inclusion of Chicago in Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative Monday  April 28  2008  For Immediate Release  Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  Recent spike in violent crime warrants additional federal resources WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today asked for a meeting with Justice Department officials and Illinois Congressional Delegation members to discuss including the Chicago metropolitan area in the Department of Justice  DOJ  s Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative   a program created in 2006 to enhance gang prevention  enforcement  and anti recidivism efforts   The Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative has so far provided ten metropolitan regions with  2 5 million each for anti gang efforts   Chicago is home to some of the largest and most violent gangs in the country  but has been left out of one of the most highly touted federal anti gang initiatives   said Durbin    We are asking the Justice Department to make combating gang violence in Chicago a top priority this summer and in the future      With as many as 40 gang related shootings in the past week alone and so many tragic deaths this year  the violence in our neighborhoods and schools is heartbreaking and has got to stop   said Obama    Chicago has experienced some of the highest rates of gang violence in the country  and combating it must be a top priority for the Department of Justice s anti gang initiative and for the federal government   We also know that we must involve the entire community   from our schools and churches to teachers and parents   it makes a difference and it saves lives   Senator Durbin and I are committed to working with Mayor Daley and Chicago s dedicated law enforcement personnel to ensure the city has the resources it needs to protect our families and keep our children safe   Since April 18  at least 48 shootings have taken place in the Chicago area resulting in at least 15 deaths   Law enforcement officials have expressed concern that as the weather warms  gang violence will remain elevated    In April 2006  DOJ released the results of its latest National Youth Gang Center survey  which indicated that over half of all homicides in Chicago were considered to be gang related   Los Angeles was the only other city in which gang activity accounted for such a high percentage of the city s homicides   The Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative is a key component of DOJ s anti gang strategy and is designed to support law enforcement combating violent gang crime  while also promoting prevention efforts that discourage gang involvement  The Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative complements existing Department of Justice programs to combat gangs and reduce gun related crime throughout the country      text of letter below and attached  April 28  2008 The Honorable Michael Mukasey  Attorney General  U S  Department of Justice  950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  D C  20530 Dear Attorney General Mukasey  We urge you to take immediate steps to focus additional resources of the Department of Justice on combating gang violence in the Chicago metropolitan area   The past 10 days have witnessed a spike in violent crimes in Chicago  with at least 48 shootings resulting in at least 15 deaths   Also  this school year 24 children in the Chicago area have been killed by gunfire   Much of this violence is attributable to gang activity  and gang violence in the region is expected to remain at an elevated level in the coming warm weather months   Reducing this level of violence will require an enhanced commitment from the Department of Justice in conjunction with state and local law enforcement and gang prevention organizations   We strongly urge the Department of Justice to make the reduction of gang violence in the Chicago area a top priority of the Department s anti gang efforts   We also request a meeting with you and appropriate Department of Justice officials  along with members of the Illinois congressional delegation  to discuss this issue   While Chicago area law enforcement agencies are working hard to head off a surge in gang violence  targeted assistance from the Department of Justice would greatly boost their gang prevention and enforcement efforts   For example  a key part of the Department of Justice s anti gang strategy is the Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative  which was created in 2006   The Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative has so far provided ten metropolitan regions with  2 5 million each in order to enhance gang prevention  enforcement  and anti recidivism efforts in those areas   In January  you testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that  focused enforcement efforts under the Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative are showing strong early results    However  Chicago is not one of the regions selected for participation in the Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative   Given the severity of the gang problem in the Chicago area and the existence of established infrastructure to support enhanced prevention  enforcement and anti recidivism efforts in Chicago  the inclusion of Chicago in the Comprehensive Anti Gang Initiative appears both appropriate and justified   We urge you to include Chicago in this Initiative  Also  after your January testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee  Senator Durbin asked you in writing to provide information on the Department of Justice s current efforts to address gang violence in the Chicago region   You have not yet responded   Before our meeting  please provide this information in writing     Ridding our communities of gang violence will require a sustained  cooperative effort involving effective prevention strategies  active enforcement  close coordination between local  state and federal governments  and a renewed focus on addressing the underlying factors that contribute to gang behavior   The Department of Justice plays a vital part in these efforts  and the Department s urgent attention is needed now in the Chicago metropolitan region   We look forward to working with you to address this challenge    Sincerely    Richard J  Durbin                                                U S  Senator  Barack Obama  U S  Senator                                                       cc  Mark Filip

from supplemental  WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement on an amendment that would remove the deadlines for redeploying U S  troops from Iraq from the supplemental appropriations bill   Obama is the sponsor of the Iraq De escalation Act  which sets March 31  2008 as the target date for redeploying U S  combat brigades from Iraq  the same target date as a provision in the supplemental   Senator Obama   s statement  submitted for the record  is below    We gather on another occasion to bring the Iraq War to its fateful end   While this effort may fall short again  we will continue to try to do what is in the national security of our country   The Iraq War should never have been authorized   I was proud to say so in 2002  but I am even more proud of the plan I have offered that calls for combat to begin redeploying on May 1st with the goal of all combat troops out of Iraq by March 2008   We also must make sure that we   re not as careless getting out of this war as we were getting in  and that   s why this withdrawal should be gradual  and keep some U S  troops in the region to prevent a wider war in the region and go after Al Qaeda and other terrorists   Those who would have us continue this war in perpetuity like to say that this is a matter of resolve on behalf of the American people   But the American people have been extraordinarily resolved   They have seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded on the streets of Fallujah  They have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this effort     money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation   No  it has not been a failure of resolve that has led us to this chaos  but a failure of strategy     a strategy that has only strengthened Iran   s strategic position  increased threats posed by terrorist organizations  reduced U S  credibility and influence around the world  and placed Israel and other nations friendly to the United States in the region in greater peril   Iraq has been a failure of strategy and that strategy must change   It is time to bring a responsible end to this conflict because there is no military solution to this war   Before we send our best off to battle in the future  we must remember what led us to this day and learn from the principles that follow   We must remember that ideology is not a foreign policy   We must not embark on war based on untested theories  political agendas or wishful thinking that have little basis in fact or reality   We must focus our efforts on the threats we know exist  and we must evaluate those threats with sound intelligence that is never manipulated for political reasons again   We must remember that the cost of going it alone is immense   It is a choice we sometimes have to make  but one that must be made rarely and always reluctantly   We must remember that planning for peace is just as critical as planning for war   Iraq was not just a failure of conception  but a failure of execution  and so when a conflict does arise that requires our involvement  we must try to understand that country   s history  its politics  its ethnic and religious divisions before our troops ever set foot on its soil   We must understand that setting up ballot boxes does automatically create a democracy   Real freedom and real stability come from doing the hard work of helping to build a strong police force  and a legitimate government  and ensuring that people have food  and water  and electricity  and basic services   And we must be honest about how much of that we can do ourselves and how much must come from the people themselves  And finally  we must remember that when we send our servicemen and women to war  we make sure we   ve given them the training they need  and the equipment that will keep them safe  and a mission they can accomplish   And when our troops come home  it is our most solemn responsibility to make sure they come home to the services  and the benefits  and the care they deserve  The cause to defend our country and our interests around the world will never end   It will be one of country   s constant threads through the ages  It is our sacred trust to ensure that those moments  those times of great struggle  are the right ones   And when they are not  we must continue to try and end those conflicts for the sake of our country our service men and women and the ideals we hold dear   For these reasons  I strongly support the provision in the supplemental bill that calls for the withdrawal of American combat troops by March 31  2008  and I will oppose any efforts to strip that provision from the bill                                   ,Obama

                                  CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to President Bush  calling on him to employ every diplomatic tool to persuade Chinese President Hu Jintao to make significant progress in resolving the Tibet issue   Given the recent events in Tibet and the upcoming Beijing Olympics  Obama asks President Bush to encourage the Chinese government to negotiate with the Dalai Lama  guarantee religious freedoms for the Tibetan people  protect Tibetan culture and language  and support the exercise of genuine autonomy for Tibet   Obama also supports Bush s insistence that foreign press and diplomatic personnel have free access to Lhasa and other Tibetan cities and villages to ensure that repression and human rights violations cannot escape the world s notice       The text of the letter is below   Dear Mr  President  The situation in Tibet is deeply disturbing  and requires that all of us  regardless of party  do what we can to try to influence it for the better   I understand that you discussed the subject on Wednesday with President Hu Jintao  The United States has many issues for which China s cooperation is important  including denuclearization of North Korea  ending Iran s nuclear program  stopping the genocide in Darfur  confronting repression in Burma  and combating global warming  However  it is important that we give high priority to the plight of Tibetans and make clear to President Hu that the way in which China treats all Chinese citizens  including Tibetans  profoundly affects how China is viewed in the United States and throughout the international community  Resolution of differences between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama is the key to progress in Tibet   The Dalai Lama  as you have said  is  a good man    He is revered by virtually all Tibetans  and his absence from his homeland creates an incurable wound in the heart of Tibetan Buddhism   Tibet s unique cultural and religious heritage cannot be preserved if he is demonized and kept at arm s length   He has accepted Beijing s precondition for a solution  namely recognition that Tibet is part of China  and has clearly stated that he is seeking religious  cultural and linguistic protection and autonomy for the Tibetan people  not independence   More recently  he indicated his belief that despite recent events  the Chinese people deserve to host the Olympics this summer    I hope you made clear to President Hu the American view about the importance of the following  a negotiation with the Dalai Lama about his return to Tibet  guarantees of religious freedom for the Tibetan people  protection of Tibetan culture and language  and the exercise of genuine autonomy for Tibet   That is the path to the stability and harmony that the Chinese leaders say they are seeking in Tibet  In addition to your personal intervention with President Hu  there are other steps I hope you will take to highlight our concern   I support your call for the foreign press and diplomatic personnel to have free access to Lhasa and other Tibetan cities and villages to ensure that repression and human rights violations cannot escape the world s notice   Beijing has committed to the International Olympic Committee to allow foreign journalists free access to cover stories throughout China  including Tibet   We should hold them to that commitment   The U S  and our democratic allies and friends should also urge the UN Human Rights Council to send an investigatory team to Tibet   China should be encouraged to allow the International Committee for the Red Cross to visit prisons in Tibet to ensure that detainees are not held under inhumane conditions  tortured  or mistreated    Like you  I want to take steps that increase the chance of a negotiated solution between Beijing and the Dalai Lama  and that have the best chance of improving the lives of ordinary Tibetans   Therefore  I support your effort to aggressively use your relationship with President Hu to achieve these goals   Should it appear  however  that the Chinese are taking private diplomacy as a license for inaction or continued repression  I would urge you to speak out forcefully and publicly to disabuse them of the notion that they can thus escape international censure  Despite the high emotions of the present time  I hope you can persuade the Chinese leadership that in this the year of the Beijing Olympics they have a unique opportunity to make dramatic progress in resolving the Tibet issue   Chinese leaders have it within their power to achieve that worthy goal if they take steps to change the situation in Tibet for the better and by reaching an accommodation with the Dalai Lama  Progress in Tibet would profoundly affect the world s perception of China as it prepares to host the Olympic Games in August  Sincerely    Barack Obama United States Senator

Hurricane Relief Contracts a Victory for Taxpayers    WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  today said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency s  FEMA  decision to rebid millions of dollars worth of federal hurricane relief contracts awarded with little or no competition is a victory for taxpayers    The Associated Press has reported that FEMA s acting director R  David Paulison said millions of dollars worth of contracts awarded with little or no competition will be rebid   More than 80 percent of at least  1 5 billion in FEMA contracts were awarded with little or no competition    FEMA s decision to rebid millions of dollars worth of hurricane relief contracts that were awarded with little or no competition is a victory for all taxpayers as well as the next generation that is already burdened with enormous debt   said Obama and Coburn   However  the fact that these contracts were ever signed in the first place underscores the importance of creating a Chief Financial Officer to oversee the Hurricane Katrina reconstruction efforts  It is crucial that we put one person in charge of constantly monitoring the billions of dollars being spent before that money goes out the door  Creating a team of inspectors general is a well intentioned but deeply flawed approach that will only create a longer list of  lessons learned  but not dollars saved     U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  introduced a bill to create a Chief Financial Officer  CFO  to oversee all expenditures associated with the Hurricane Katrina relief and reconstruction effort   The Hurricane Katrina CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  staffed with experts from relevant federal agencies  and would have management and oversight over any agency using federal funds for the recovery   The CFO would issue monthly financial reports to Congress  and the Government Accountability Office would issue quarterly reports to Congress reviewing the work of the CFO and recovery activities    Richard Skinner  the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security said that FEMA officials awarding contracts  took a lot of shortcuts that may have resulted in a lot of waste    said Obama and Coburn   We should appoint a CFO immediately to ensure that rebuilding and reconstruction money gets to the people who need it the most     SUMMARY OF COBURN OBAMA  OVERSEE ACT    A Chief Financial Officer  CFO  would be established and would be responsible for the efficient and effective use of federal funds in all activities relating to the recovery from Hurricane Katrina    Unlike an IG which audits money after it has been spent  the CFO would review expenditures before they are approved  This is a better way to protect against waste  fraud  and abuse   The CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  and located in the Executive Office of the President   The CFO office would be staffed with experts detailed from relevant federal agencies  would have management and oversight of each federal agency involved in the recovery effort  and would work in conjunction with the inspectors general in each of these agencies and the president   Every month  the CFO would issue financial reports to Congress on the use of federal funds  These reports would include information about the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to persons most in need  the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to companies that hire local workers  and the use of no bid and  cost plus  contracts  The Government Accountability Office  GAO  would issue quarterly reports reviewing the activities and expenses approved by the CFO  These reports would examine the accuracy of the CFO s reports and include information on the use of no bid or  cost plus  contracts  whether federal funds have been used for their intended purposes  and the extent to which federal funds have helped persons most in need and local workers                                    ,Obama

 Obama Press Office  202 228 5566 Nearly 9 million children currently lack health insurance WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to President Bush  calling on him to immediately rescind newly implemented restrictive policies for the Children   s Health Insurance Program  CHIP  and commit to supporting the program   s reauthorization   In the letter  Obama expresses serious concerns that the Administration   s new program requirements essentially abandon the children who need help the most by limiting access to CHIP   In August  the Senate voted to expand CHIP coverage to an additional four million children    The text of the letter is below  Dear Mr  President  I am writing to express my serious concerns over the Administration   s new policies for the Children   s Health Insurance Program  CHIP    These policies  which are detailed in a letter on August 17  2007  to state health officials from Dennis Smith  Director of the Center for Medicaid and State Operations  would severely restrict the ability of states to address the needs of its most vulnerable residents   There are few issues in this country that reflect a greater disconnect between what the American people want and the way Washington operates than health care coverage   And nowhere is this divide more apparent than in the millions of American children who lack health insurance   These are children who did not choose where they were born or how much money their parents have  children whose development depends on the care and nourishment they receive in those early years  children who any parent  anywhere  should want to protect at any cost   Insuring these children is a top priority for the American people  and those of us in Washington must do everything we can to protect them  One quarter of all children and half of low income children receive their health coverage through Medicaid or CHIP   Medicaid covers nearly 30 million poor and near poor children  and CHIP covers 6 7 million additional low income children and pregnant woman   Although we can debate the effectiveness of some federal programs  CHIP has been an unqualified success   After its enactment  the uninsured rate among low income children fell by more than one third from 1997 2005  even as the number and rate of uninsured adults rose steadily during the same time period    Unfortunately  this national trend has not continued  and the number of children without health coverage has started to rise since 2005   This reversal adds urgency to the national call to reauthorize and expand CHIP  and not contract it as the Administration   s new policies will do   Among the changes detailed in Mr  Smith   s letter is a requirement that states must demonstrate that they have enrolled at least 95 percent of the children with family incomes below 200 percent of poverty level before they can extend the eligibility limit to 250 percent   However  as your officials are well aware  no state has enrolled 95 percent of eligible children in CHIP to date   The Administration also proposes that in families with incomes above 250 percent of poverty level  children must be uninsured for a year before they can be eligible for CHIP   This requirement essentially abandons the children who need our help the most     those whose parents have lost their jobs and their employer provided health insurance   Today  nine million of our children still do not have health insurance  and the vast majority of Americans are calling on our government to do something about it   The Congress has done its part by recently passing the Senate reauthorization bill to allow an additional four million children to be covered and the House bill to cover upwards of five million children   State governments are also successfully tackling this enormous challenge by increasing outreach and enrollment  expanding eligibility  and by building upon CHIP as part of their state universal coverage initiatives    It is now time for the Administration to do its part for our children   We must ensure that all children have access to the health care they need  when they need it   As long as there are children in our country who lack health care coverage  we are fundamentally betraying the very morals and ideals we hold in our hearts as Americans   I ask that you immediately rescind these new policies and commit to passing the reauthorization of this critical program  Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator                                   ,Obama

Inspector General for the VA   Mr  Griffin        Applause from the audience    MODERATOR PONCE   And it is now my pleasure to introduce Senator Richard Durbin        Applause from the audience    SENATOR DURBIN   My thanks to Phil Ponce  to Wright College and Secretary Nicholson     First  let me thank the veterans   Once again  we are gathering together to honor what you have given to America  to make certain that it goes beyond the speeches of Memorial Day and the speeches you will hear at the campaigns to show our commitment to you by what we do  rather than what we say     Thank you for what you gave to this country  and what you continue to give  and we ll continue to stand by you and make sure that you re treated fairly   Thank you so much for being here today     Let me say to Secretary Nicholson  thank you   Thank you for keeping your word for coming to Chicago  as you promised Senator Obama and me several months ago to meet with the veterans of the Chicagoland area to talk about the challenges we face     Secretary Nicholson  it wasn t your leadership that brought us to this point today  but it is your leadership that can lead us from this point forward to make certain that we treat veterans fairly in every region of the country  certainly in the area of Chicago     Let me also say about those who work for the Veterans Administration   There are many conscientious  hard working  good people working for the VA at the hospitals  at the clinics  at the offices   We salute them   We thank them   If there is room for improvement  we want to work with them to make certain that the VA continues to be an agency that serves our veterans so well     So now a thanks to their report of the Inspector General  we come together today armed with the facts  armed with information  and the information that has been given to us unfortunately is disappointing     Too many times Illinois vets were denied disability claims and compensation unfairly not one year  not for five years  but for 20 years Illinois ranked dead last in the United States of America compensating its victims   We can talk about demographics and trends  but it won t explain the fact that we were last in the nation 20 straight years     There is more to the story   And when you look closely at the IG s report  you can see it   If a veteran came in to pursue a claim and didn t bring a VSO or an attorney with him  he was likely to receive maybe only half of what he was entitled to   We also know that the worst experience dealt with claims where there was some subjective judgment   It wasn t an amputation   It was a question of how much of a loss   In those cases  IG s report tells us there was a wide disparity     For posttraumatic stress disorder  100 percent  it turns out in New Mexico  you were five times more likely to receive it than the State of Illinois   When it comes to individual unemployability  it turns out if you were in one of the high states that the IG s report analyzed  you were three times more likely to receive it than in the states of the low states  like Illinois     The conclusion for decades   Illinois veterans pursuing a claim without an attorney came up with a about half of what they were entitled to  and if the claim involved a subjective decision  they may have received as little at 20 cents on the dollar compared to other states     Let me see    we have to also take a look at the Chicago Regional Office   The report of our veterans on that Regional Office is a call for leadership and a call for change in that office        Applause from the audience    SENATOR DURBIN   We have to make certain that the veterans coming to that office do not leave disappointed  feeling that they didn t receive a timely  fair  prompt and thorough decision     I think things are getting better   The report indicates they are   But we can improve even more  and we have to strive to do that     Secondly  we have to make sure that when it comes to resources  we provide them   When you do a survey across America and have almost 2 000 people working in VA office surveyed  and two thirds of them say there just aren t enough people working here to keep up with the case load to treat the veterans fairly  that is a call to arms not just for the Secretary  but for members of Congress to appropriate the money to put it in the Veterans Administration system     Let me close by saying this          Applause from the audience      SENATOR DURBIN   Let me close by saying this   We need to make sure that we don t fight a war on the cheap  and we ve got to make certain that we don t serve our veterans on the cheap   We have to say to veterans  soldiers of today and the young men and women we are trying to recruit that we will stand behind you     When it comes to posttraumatic stress disorder  we have to acknowledge the obvious   There is a wave of challenges coming at us   We haven t dealt with this issue as seriously and completely as we should have     I thank you for gathering today  for adding your voices in this meeting to tell us what our challenge will be   I thank you for your leadership and making America safer   And now let s work together to make veterans across Illinois fairly compensated and respected for what they gave to our country          Applause from the audience     MODERATOR PONCE   Thank you  Senator Durbin   And now it is my pleasure to introduce Senator Barack Obama        Applause from the audience    SENATOR OBAMA   Thank you so much   Thank you  everybody   It is wonderful to see this great turnout   Many of you participated in some Town Hall meetings that we had when I was first elected  and one of my first priorities was obtaining a seat on the Veterans Committee  because as I traveled across the state  the thing I consistently saw was that our best and our brightest  having fought for in wars  having provided that enormous devotion to their country were coming back and feeling neglected  feeling mistreated  feeling ignored     And the thing that I pledged when I was sworn in as the Senator was that if nothing else in the first couple of years in the Senate  I could make absolutely certain that there would have been a strong advocate in the United States Senate          Applause from the audience    SENATOR OBAMA   It so happened  it so happened that as I was joining the Veterans Committee  that a story broke in the Sun Times indicating that there was a huge discrepancy between disability payments for Illinois veterans relative to veterans in other states   These were not small discrepancies   We re talking about discrepancies on the magnitude of  5 000   And immediately we requested  Senator Durbin and myself  meeting with Secretary Nicholson  to not only find out why this had occurred  but more importantly how we were going to solve it     I am grateful for Secretary Nicholson on following through on his pledge to come and report directly to Illinois veterans   And I am grateful to the IG s office for conducting their report in a timely fashion   But the purpose of the meeting today is not only to go over what has happened in the past  it is to make absolutely certain that it never happens again          Applause from the audience    SENATOR OBAMA   That s going to be our top priority   I just want to    I have a visual here  just to underscore what Senator Durbin talked about   This is a chart that was included in the report  Review of State Variances in VA Disability Compensation Payments   This is contained in the report prepared by the IG     The first year  1985  go back all the way up to 2000   If you look from 1985 to 2004  Illinois ranks 50th every single year  each and every year   It is not 49 some years  it is not 42nd some years  it is every single year it is number 50     Now  as Senator Durbin indicated  it appears that there have been some improvements in terms of new claims   If you were lucky enough to file your claim in the last year or the last two years or the last three years  then it appears based on the report prepared by the IG that you have a good likelihood of doing relatively well if you re an Illinois veteran     But one of the critical issues that I think  Mr  Secretary  we re going to need to talk about today is what happens to all the veterans who filed their claims during this 20 year period          Applause from the audience      SENATOR OBAMA   How can we make them whole   I know based on some of the statements that were made yesterday that the Veterans Administration has as a matter of policy the ability of every veteran to appeal their claims   But from my perspective  at least  and I think Senator Durbin shares this view  it is not sufficient to say to veterans who may have been shortchanged for 20 years  well  you can go through the same process all over again  wait for the same number of years as you went through before  and potentially get the same results     It strikes me that there should be some way to expedite and review what happened during this 20 year period in order to make certain that people are treated fairly  and they don t have to wait     Let me just close by saying this  because we want to leave sufficient time for the Secretary and for your questions   If you look structurally at what is happening in the Office here in Chicago and in Illinois  what is clear is that despite the fine work of many officers who are working within Veterans Affairs  they are understaffed  they are not able to produce timely and accurate reports  they are not able to do the job that needs to be done on behalf of veterans     Now  the President issued the budget in which he said we don t need more money for the VA   And you know  as Senator Durbin said  this is not something that you caused   You just came in   And so I m not holding you responsible for what has happened in the past  but my understanding at least was  and you testified before my Committee  I was sitting there  that we have adequate resources to meet the challenges     I guess my point is that if we ve got the majority of your own employees indicating that we are not sufficiently staffed in order to provide timely service to these veterans  then it seems to me that we ve got to come up with the resources to make sure that we fix that system          Applause from the audience    SENATOR OBAMA   If we don t  if we don t  then what I fear will happen is that we will have some nice words at this meeting today  but three years  four years when the cameras aren t here and the newspapers aren t around  we start slipping back into the same situation that we have had for the last two decades  and that s what I want to prevent     So I hope that there is going to be in your responses some structural issues that are addressed in terms of how we can improve what happens in Chicago  what happens in Illinois  to make certain that our veterans  who have done such great service for all of us  that we are repaying the debt that we owe each and everyone of them     Thank you very much  everybody          Applause from the audience     MODERATOR PONCE   Thank you  Senator   Thank you  Senator Obama     Our next speaker grew up on a tenant farm in Iowa   He is one of seven children   He is a 1961 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point   He served eight years on active duty as a paratrooper and Ranger qualified Army Officer   He served 22 years in the Army Reserve  and retired as a Colonel   While serving in Vietnam  he earned the Bronze Star Medal  Combat Infantryman Badge  the Meritorious Service Medal  the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry and two Air Medals     Please join me in welcoming the Honorable R  James Nicholson  Secretary to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs          Applause from the audience     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Good afternoon  everyone   Thank you for this opportunity of being here   I want to thank particularly Senator Durbin  Senator Obama for inviting me to come and giving me the opportunity to be here with you and to be heard   I want to send my greetings to the Lieutenant Governor of the State  Mr  Quinn  and I also want to thank the many colleagues that I have here from the VA     I was very happy to get this invitation to come here  and doubly happy that our Inspector General really accelerated his place so that we could have his report  his study completed  and informed so that we could make it public  which we will do here today with copies for you  if you want to take one with you     Just before coming here today  it was my pleasure to be out at the Hines VA Hospital campus where we dedicated a new spinal cord injury clinic and a new blind rehabilitation center out there  which so far as I know  the first tangible results of our new CARES or asset realignment process in the VA where we re trying to have VA services the closest and most convenient that we can to where the veterans are     A lot of facilities were built during or just after the war   We ve had great demographic shifts since then  and some facilities need to be closed  others need to be expanded  like we ve just done  which we were able to do because we consolidated some other facilities     For nearly 75 years  I say nearly  in July  it will be 75 years  that s our 75th Birthday   The Department of Veterans Affairs has honored this nation s commitment to our veterans   It is a commitment rooted in the values that we Americans place on those of you who have worn our nation s uniform     I have a special perspective on this  because four months ago  I was an Ambassador in Italy at the Vatican when I was asked to come back to take this job   And the other ambassadors from all over the world said what is it you re going to do  you are going to be a minister  as they say in new government   What will you do   I said if confirmed by the Senate  I will be the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs     None of them knew what I was talking about   They had a vacuous look on their face   There is no other country in the world that has something like we have in our VA  and it speaks to the value that we have for the veterans     This Town Hall communicates yet another important message I think   There is a question concerning the process by which the VA has provided  and continues to provide benefits and services to our veterans   And this has come to the light of day here and we are addressing it     Late last year  when press reports questioned the fairness of our claims process  the Inspector General  who is an independent agency of our Department  was asked by my predecessor to do a system wide review of our claims and benefits process to see what problems there are or might be   After all  our long standing commitment is that every veteran s claim will be treated fairly and equitably no matter where that veteran might live     As many of you know  the Inspector General released his report yesterday  along with eight recommendations   They are good recommendations I think  and we are taking them seriously  and we are taking them on board  and we re going to take action     In fact  seated at this table right down here to the right of Senator Durbin is our VA Inspector General  Richard Griffin  who has come here today to answer questions on his report if so appropriate     Seated right beside him is a gentleman that has already been introduced  that s the Undersecretary for Benefits for the VA  Admiral Dan Cooper   His charge to me is to make sure that those recommendations become reality     And let me conclude by saying something as clearly and sincerely as I can   We are committed to doing what is right for our veterans   If that entails that we have to set up a special operation here in Illinois to review your claims or to look at new claims that you as an eligible veteran want to make  we will do that   We want each of you to feel that you have been treated fairly and equitably by your VA  because you deserve that     The past is past  but as I have been charged by both of these Senators  the future is now  and we are going to make a special effort to see if we can have you feel sure that you have been treated fairly and equitably by the VA so that you will have a chance if you so choose to have a review of that  or you can bring the new information to us  and we will make every effort to see that that is reviewed  and reviewed fairly and equitably for you     Thank you          Applause from the audience     MODERATOR PONCE   Thank you  Mr  Secretary     At this point I will be reading questions from the audience  and when I read the question  I am going to read the name of the person who submitted the question  and I would invite you to stand or raise your hand as your question is being answered     The first question comes from John Donnegan of Chicago  U S  Army   The question is for Secretary Nicholson   Mr  Donnegan  would you care to indicate where you are     MR  DONNEGAN   Right here     MODERATOR PONCE   Thank you   And the question is for Secretary   Why does a veteran need representation in order to get benefits     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Can you hear me   Is it working     Well  the short answer is that you don t   But the veteran service organizations  American Legion  VFW  et cetera  have people that are trained  and they can make available to become advocates for a veteran in filling out a claim  and so it is up to the veteran about whether or not he or she wants to make use of these veteran service representative organizations    SENATOR OBAMA   Can I just make a comment on that   The    Secretary Nicholson is correct that it is not required  but and perhaps the Inspector General wants to comment on this as well   This study shows that those who use VSO advocates tend to receive substantially higher benefits than those who do not     So my first piece of advice to everybody  every veteran here  work with your VSO  because it makes a difference          Applause from the audience    SENATOR OBAMA   If I m not mistaken  Mr  Secretary or Inspector General  the difference is as much as  1 700    SENATOR DURBIN   62    SENATOR OBAMA   Excuse me    6 200 if you use one of these advocates as opposed to when you didn t   And I think that part of my understanding in terms of some of the variables that create discrepancies between states is that some states have higher utilization of these VSOs than others do   Is that correct     MR  GRIFFIN   If I may  we have placed 300 copies of the executive summary of our report on a table in the hallway so that you could pick the report up  take a look at it   If you have questions that don t get addressed today that you would like to ask me about  please call us   The entire report  which is 200 pages  is available on our website  which is identified inside the cover     Just a point of clarification about how these different numbers are over the years   The first numbers that triggered the local interest in the payments that we received in Illinois represented the average payment that was the result of ratings done in Illinois for the past 60 years  and it was an average payment   So if you had a rating done in 1946  and it hasn t changed  your rating is part of that average     What we did is we looked at more current data  because to go back to  45 and  46  first of all  we didn t have time to do that  and secondly  we wanted to see what has been happening lately     And in looking at the data for the last six years  for the first half of fiscal year  05  the Chicago office ranks fifth in the country for new and reopened claims  just so you are aware of that     As far as the 6 225 goes  that number came from our examination of the 60 years worth of data   The  1 700 that the Senator referred to initially refers to the delta for ratings done in 2004   So it has shrunk  perhaps it has shrunk because of legislation that created Duty to Assist by VBA   And the fact is that if you are strapped from a human resources standpoint  if you have VSOs who are familiar with the system  who can work in support of the VBA employees   SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Say what VBA is    MR  GRIFFIN   I m sorry   Veterans Benefits Administration   That s like a fourth multiplier for them  and they also know how it is done  and that results in these higher numbers    MODERATOR PONCE   The next question comes from Tom Brophy  U S  Army from Oswego   Mr  Brophy  if you care to stand or indicate   MR  BROPHY   Here you go   MODERATOR PONCE   Thank you   This is his question is for the Secretary  and the question is   Considering that half of the reasons for Illinois  low ranking deal with demographics that can t be changed  how do you account for Illinois raising average benefits in the last two years  aside from rater subjectivity   Mr  Secretary     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   I think that s a real good question  and the technical expertise that we have here resides in Undersecretary for Benefits and the IG who did this research study   So I will ask first for Admiral Cooper to respond  and then if you have anything to add  please do  Mr  Griffin     ADMIRAL COOPER   I would say the major factors are the changes that we started making three years ago   Four years ago the Secretary of the VA asked that a study be done  and I was asked to chair that study   I came in and got some very knowledgeable people  and realized that across VA  we were doing things in disparate ways  each RO was operating differently   And so as a result  we set up some very specific rules as to how it is organized  how the IT applications are done  how the processes are set up   We then set up better specialized training   We also set up very specific oversight from Headquarters where I have people who will go out and visit the regional offices to make sure they re doing much better     So I think everybody was raised   I also think that the Regional Office Director that went in about the year 2000 and other people that we have put in there who are very talented have helped to a great degree     MODERATOR PONCE   The next question was submitted without a name   The question is   It is my understanding that it takes 300 days to certify an appeal   What are you doing to reduce the backlog   Mr  Secretary    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   I don t know if it is 300  and Admirable Cooper can respond to that more specifically  but the appeals do take time   They re appealed initially to the Board of Veterans Appeals  which is an independent  quasi independent board that reviews the decision of our claim adjudicator  and they will typically ask for more data from the hospitals and from the doctors that made the examination  and they may need to see more things from the veteran s record     And so there is  there is pervasive time  a drag in there  if you will  where that data has to be gotten where those reviews have to be accomplished     I will ask Admiral Cooper if he has anything he would like to add    ADMIRAL COOPER   First I would like to say that yes  it is 300 days to date   Two years ago  it was 400 some days   That is not much relief  but that at least explains that we are trying to make progress     Secondly  I would say to you this   Veterans Claims Assistance Act that came into effect in late 2001 laid down very specific time requirements  and one of those is whenever we send you a letter and say we need some information  you have at least 60 days to answer that letter   And every time we find a new fact and we need to get new information from you or ask for an explanation  that is another 60 days that is allowed   So let me say the time is too long   We re working very hard on it     The final point I would make to you is we are today getting about 800 000 claims a year into the VBA   So all those things are factors   They are too long   We re working on it very hard     MODERATOR PONCE   Senator Durbin    SENATOR DURBIN   If I could just follow up on that   It was an excellent question  and here is some information that I would like to ask the Secretary or Admiral or someone to respond to     Currently it takes the Chicago VA office 206 days from receipt of a claim until final decision   That s 39 days more than the national average of 167 days   We ve also learned that the office  Chicago office sends almost one out of four claims  23 percent  to Cleveland  St  Louis  Muskogee  Oklahoma  or Milwaukee to be processed     We also find out that when it comes to appeals  that in this situation  Chicago had 56 percent of its appeals cases kicked back for more information last year   This year so far  182 cases out of 376  almost half decided by the Board of Veterans Appeals  have been remanded back to the Chicago VA for more documents   It takes two years to reach the point where it is remanded   It can be doubled that time once it is sent back     So I think what this tells us is  and what you just said  we need more people   We need more people processing these claims          Applause from the audience     SENATOR DURBIN   And I    I know having worked in Washington for a while and members and delegates  and I think Senator Obama raised the fact  but I have to ask you  Mr  Secretary  how can we make good on our promise to do a timely review of these claims and appeals without more people to get the job done     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   That s a fair question and fair comment   If  if we need more people in this office  I think we ve added some already  we will add them     But let me just point out  because there is    in this appeals process  as Admiral Cooper just said  there are statutory time plugs in there of 60 days every time something new is needed from you  you have 60 days to respond     So I would say if you come in and we re working with you  give your information back to us just as quickly as you can     AUDIENCE MEMBER   How is that going to get more people     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   If we need more people here  we re going to get them   And as I said when I spoke earlier  this is a    it looks like  you know  we could make a special effort for you to come in and have a review or come in with a new claim  and we re going to have people there to process it and do it just as timely as we can     AUDIENCE MEMBER   Are you going to get more people     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   I would    I would say yes  we are  because it is           Applause from the audience    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   We re probably going to need      MODERATOR PONCE   The next question comes from Mr  John Piciolo   He is from Lockport  Illinois  and Mr  Piciolo  would you like to raise your hand or stand  sir     He has a two part question   Do the proposed funding levels for  06 reflect the anticipated need of vets returning from Iraq  number one     And number two  will vets currently in the system have benefits reduced to accommodate the new vets   Mr  Secretary     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Good question   The answer is yes   The budget that has been submitted by the President to the Congress is a record budget   The VA budgets have gone up 47 percent in the last four years   This record is a record budget if its approved at that level  and it anticipates our needs of our returning heroes from Iraq and Afghanistan     And as to the second part of your question  sir  by having them being a priority in our treatment will not diminish the care that we give to our existing veterans     SENATOR OBAMA   Mr  Piciolo  I just want to comment   You know  the Secretary presented the President s budget  and you know  I have utmost respect for the Secretary being here  being willing to talk to the veterans directly  but I do have to say that the initial budget presented by the President  if I m not mistaken  called for a one half of one percent increase over previous years  not sufficient to cover the anticipated return of the significant number of Iraqi and Afghani troops     Senator Durbin has done some terrific work documenting the incidents of posttraumatic stress disorder that in previous years often times went undiagnosed   If we re doing our job well  it will be diagnosed this time   All that seems to point to a need for significant additional resources if we re not going to have a situation in which either the timetables get stretched out further for claims  or the amount of time that it takes for veterans to receive services is prolonged     And so I guess I m just wondering  just if you can amplify a little bit on the question  are you currently reviewing next year s budget to accommodate for this growth from what we anticipate to be more veterans coming into the system     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   You re talking about the  06     SENATOR OBAMA   The  06 budget    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Yes  we are looking at that   That s a dynamic process  and it is     AUDIENCE MEMBER   What about the  100 billion to treat illegal immigrants    SENATOR OBAMA   Hold on a second    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   We are    I also want to point out  Senator  is that in that budget  we do have  100 million requested increases for PTSD  research and frequency    SENATOR OBAMA   Okay    MODERATOR PONCE   The next question is from George Fraser   Mr  Fraser  if you care to stand or raise your hand   The question is   Hines doctors are very good  as well as assistants  but delays in treatment and mistakes with paperwork and determinations are the norm     Secretary Nicholson  would you please respond to this observation     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Well  if they re making mistakes or delays  I m sorry to hear that   I will tell you that I ve been in this job now almost four months and have visited many of our hospitals  including Hines today  and I m extremely proud as an American and as a veteran and as a Secretary of the job of what the people are doing at our hospitals  I have been extremely impressed     And even more importantly than what I think of them probably is what third party evaluators do   And recently we had an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine that said the VA Integrated Health Delivery System is the best there is   It said that about the VA   And I can brag about that  because I didn t make it that way  but I m very proud and grateful that it is     Is it perfect  probably not   But the staff that I have met in these hospitals  most of whom can make more money elsewhere  work there  and the common denominator in their response to me when I say how can we keep you  how do we keep you at the VA  they said I get to take care of veterans   So they really believe in what they re doing     If there is a chronic case of mistakes or delays  I would like to know more about it individually  because I m sure we can correct that     AUDIENCE MEMBER   Why is there no nurse s aides on the second and third shift at Hines   Nurses have to          Inaudible comment made in the      audience      MODERATOR PONCE   The question was  and then we will stick to the cards  the question has to do with why there are no nurses on the second or third floor     AUDIENCE MEMBER   Nurse s aides    MODERATOR PONCE   The nurses have to take care of everyone   AUDIENCE MEMBER   On the second and third shifts  nurses that are on shifts now have no one else to help them   They cover all of the things that happen on the ward     MODERATOR PONCE   So the question is      AUDIENCE MEMBER   They have to take care of all the patients  if there is any kind of accidents  if they soil their beds  if they soil the floor  they have to come and take care of it   When you ring your buzzer and ask why  you have some need for yourself  you are lucky if someone comes within an hour     Before  it used to be  and even three or four years ago  if you would ring that buzzer and somebody would be there within ten minutes   MODERATOR PONCE   All right   Let s get a response to that  and then we will stick with the cards   Secretary    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   I m not able to respond to this in the detail  but I will  if we get your name and so forth  I will find out and get you an answer     MODERATOR PONCE   I am reminded that there are specific health officials here in the lobby area who can respond to specific kinds of concerns  so if you have any more questions along those lines  there are people to respond to your questions     The next question comes from Ben Dock Wagner   Mr  Wagner  if you want to raise your hand     MR  WAGNER   Right here   MODERATOR PONCE   The question is according to the error rate for 2003  why are 27 percent of disability claims in Illinois decided incorrectly     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Do you have a response to that Admiral     ADMIRAL COOPER   I will merely say that we are continuing to look at it  we continually look at it   And the report I have as of three days ago that the error rate is about 10 to 11 percent  which is still not good enough     I don t know the 27 percent of three years ago   I know we have tried to work very hard and beat people down to get these thing right     AUDIENCE MEMBER   Could I get a mike over here     MODERATOR PONCE   Real quickly  yes  sir   And sir  I would say if you have a follow up question  get to the question so we can get to other questions too  please   Thank you   AUDIENCE MEMBER   My follow up question would be another question     MODERATOR PONCE   Go ahead   AUDIENCE MEMBER   The VA is telling me  what I know about this  I have been involved with    as an Airmen officer  and they are telling us  they say a severed leg is worth more in Montana than it is in Illinois  and it just doesn t make sense          Applause from the audience     AUDIENCE MEMBER   I will give you one example   I have a friend in Texas  who was at the same battle of the Chosen as I was   My buddy that was in the Battle of the Chosen Reservoir lives in Texas   We have the same 85 percent disability from frostbite where we lost part of our toes and our ears  and he    I get  1 400 less a month than he does     One more point   On my  1 400  I m supposed to be getting 2 250  and I m retired  and they take it out of my Navy retirement  and we fought that   President Bush did sign a law to drop concurrent receipt  and the VA turned around  and here is what they did  boys and girls  they phased it over a ten year period   I will be dead and buried before I ever get my money   Thank you very much          Applause from the audience     MODERATOR PONCE   Mr  Secretary  before we answer that  we are going to be sticking to the cards after that  because I would like to get to those of you who submitted the cards   Unfortunately we are going to have to have to limit the impromptu questions from the audience  as legitimate as they are     Mr  Secretary    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   First of all  thank you for your service   I will tell you that the loss of a limb is the same everywhere     AUDIENCE MEMBER   No  it isn t   Cost more to live in Texas    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   I m going to refer to our Inspector General  if he wants to elaborate a bit on that answer  and then I can take up or have one of our people talk to you individually   I have people here that they will be here all day and into the evening for those of you who want to talk with them about your specific case  sir     AUDIENCE MEMBER   All right   Thanks a lot          Inaudible comments made from the      audience      MODERATOR PONCE   Excuse me   We really have to take the cards    MR  GRIFFIN   May I respond to that     MODERATOR PONCE   Thank you   MR  GRIFFIN   In the course of our review  we reviewed 270 000 cases involving below the knee amputation  above the knee amputation    can I just   These are real examples  just so you have the benefit of the information  and deafness  and we checked by diagnostic code for those things   Because it was suggested during the course of our review that a below the knee amputee in Chicago ought to get the same money as a below the knee amputee in another part of the country     So we specifically pulled that data  and for the 270 000 cases that we looked it that four categories  we had about a 99 percent consistency rating   The ones that were not consistent  we referred to VBA     And we re finding out some of them  the reason they were different than the assigned rating is that they had a secondary condition that caused them to get more     I would think  as the Secretary said  I would take your case to the Regional Office people here and have them review it          Inaudible comments made by the      audience      SENATOR OBAMA   Sir    AUDIENCE MEMBER   I have been there many times    SENATOR OBAMA   Mr  Inspector General  this might be a good time to amplify for the veterans the point that seems to be made in the report  that is  if there is inconsistencies when it is an identifiable physical disability  but it does appear that there are huge discrepancies when it comes to ailments like posttraumatic stress disorder  in which some states are receiving significantly higher than others     Part of the concern  Senator Durbin and I spoke yesterday and talked to your assistant  was that our understanding  and maybe you can explain this to me  is that the criteria by which you evaluate and rate these disabilities was first designed in the 1940s when my grandfather  a WW II vet was first leaving Patton s Army  and it strikes me that there has been a lot of medical advances since that time   We have a lot more information about the difficulties that many veterans face     I m wondering what systematic steps we can start taking to update that system to start achieving more consistency across states     MR  GRIFFIN   As indicated in our report  using the disability such as PTSD  which involves obviously mental conditions  which are not easily measured  there is a wide discrepancy or variance depending on where you re located   Some of that variance may be due to the fact that the stressor event to which the PTSD benefit is tied is not present  and therefore  it brings into question that rating     Let me say this   We reviewed 2 100 PTSD files in seven different regional offices   We looked at two in what we call the high cluster in states that had the highest average payment  and we looked at two at the bottom  and we looked at three in the middle   In looking at those cases  my audit staff used the protocol that Veterans Benefits Administration has in their manual for rating PTSD cases     In the cases we reviewed  in two of those seven regional offices  one office had a 40 percent error rate  and I defined that by saying that when we looked in that case file  there was nothing in the file that would support the stressor event that their claim was tied to   That s a problem     And Admiral Cooper has agreed that they will take a second look at those   Another office was at 36 7 percent   Illinois was at 21 7 percent of the PTS    of the 300 files we looked at here  where we couldn t locate in the file what the stressor event was     So it is a problem   There is variance   It needs some work   It is 45 year old rating schedule   It doesn t reflect the technology of today  or the employment opportunities of today   Because right after World War II  there are different opportunities today  and although the schedule and the system has been increased over the years  it needs to be given a thorough going over     If you have never seen that rating schedule  it is about the size of the Chicago yellow pages   The raters have been trying to go through that sometimes with only very general terms to describe the condition  such as mild  moderate  severe  pronounced   It doesn t give them a lot of help to try and determine which of those ratings is most appropriate    SENATOR DURBIN   I would like to say one word on this   I want to say a word about this posttraumatic stress disorder  and I want to salute Lieutenant Governor Pat Quinn on this   We ve been working together   I think this is a huge growing problem that we re going to face in the Veterans Administration          Applause from the audience     SENATOR DURBIN   I just    we have had  Lieutenant Governor Quinn and I had have town meetings where vets coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan   You Vietnam vets know what I m talking about   If they don t get a helping hand quickly  things can go down fast in their lives     Mr  Inspector General  when I read the summary  page seven  here is what you write  talking about 100 percent disability related to PTSD  and here is what you write     For example  New Mexico has the highest payment average of  12 004  and 12 6 of its veterans are in this group   Illinois has the lowest average payment of  6 961  and only 2 8 percent of its compensation recipients are rated 100 percent     So it is not only the fact that almost five times as many veterans are receiving compensation for this problem in New Mexico  the payment that they re receiving is almost twice as much          Applause from the audience     SENATOR DURBIN   So if you could    could you address that particular issue   This goes beyond subjectivity as I see it  if I read your figures correctly    MR  GRIFFIN   New Mexico is one of the states that we reviewed PTSD cases in   We had a problem with 35 percent of the 300 cases we reviewed   Again  we used the same protocol in all seven offices   When we finished  we sat down with the three Regional Office directors at all seven locations  and although as you would expect  there was some push back on some of the cases that we challenged   More than half of them they agreed on  and in one office they agreed with 94 percent of our conclusions     You are right   It is a growing problem   It is a real condition   Please don t misunderstand   I know that   I also know  though  that at the end of fiscal year 1998  VBA was paying  1 7 billion a year for posttraumatic stress compensation   And at the end of fiscal year 2004  they re paying  4 3 billion   So it has gone up 2 6 billion     And you should know that the cases that my people reviewed  and we just review them and report what we find  we reviewed the cases in Illinois   Illinois was one of the regional offices we came to  and the fact is we had on average 25 percent over the seven locations that were not supported by a stressor event in the file     So it has grown   No question   There are other denominators that are attached to it   We found that upon achieving 100 percent ratings  39 percent of the 92 that we looked at for this circumstance ceased coming in for mental health treatment   They continued to come to the VA for other treatment  but 39 percent of them  their mental health treatments went away by 82 percent  and some of them never came back     So we have to realistically look at this and determine  you know  what s going on  and I think that s what is going to happen     AUDIENCE MEMBER   Part of those are 18 000 homeless guys    MODERATOR PONCE   Our next    excuse me   Excuse me   We need to move on  because time is limited     Our next question  Mr  Secretary  comes from David Rogers   Mr  Rogers  would you care to    Mr  Rogers     The question is  Mr  Secretary  what can you do  what will you do to bring emergency relief to homeless and disenfranchised vets          Applause from the audience     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   That s a very important question  and we are working on that diligently   In fact  I was here in Chicago  now I think maybe it has been four weeks ago  to break ground for a 131 bed shelter facility in conjunction with the Archdiocese of Chicago and Catholic Charities on the old St  Leo parish in South Chicago   That s going to be a beautiful facility  and we  the VA are going to co position a community based outpatient clinic right there with it  and a vocational rehabilitation training facility   So we ve made a major commitment to that     This is a big problem for our country   There are we think over 300 000 homeless veterans in America  and as far as I m concerned  there shouldn t be any   And we  the President  the President has thrown down a gauntlet when he came into office that in ten years  we want to end chronic homelessness for veterans  and we are making strives towards that     I chair the Intergovernmental Task Force on Housing with some other cabinet officers   We have a meeting coming up I think the week after next   It is a priority of the government  and we need to do these public private partnerships with faith based organizations  lever all we can so that we can  number one  find facilities for our homeless veterans  and then two  do the therapeutic programs that it takes to help them break barriers  their addictions  their chronic conditions  and give them hope and self value so we could get them back to being the productive people that they once were          Inaudible comment from the      audience      AUDIENCE MEMBER   I have not had the biggest snow job  inaudible    Thank God I met you in Skokie at the Lithuanian American Post   I ve got two letters  one for you and one for Senator Durbin and Senator Obama  because I know something will be taken care of   These are for you   SENATOR DURBIN   One of my staff people  Christina  if she s still around     MODERATOR PONCE   This is a question from Katie Boisie of Chatham  Illinois   Ms  Boisie  would you care to stand     The question is to Senator Obama   Senator Obama  what opportunities are there for personnel returning from OIF to support the veterans  especially those injured or needing further assistance     I m not sure  could you explain what the OIF is     AUDIENCE MEMBER   Operation Iraqi Freedom   MODERATOR PONCE   Thank you   SENATOR OBAMA   Well  you know  I think this is a wonderful question  and that is how can we utilize our veterans to help veterans  because I know that in some of the Town Hall meetings that we ve had  a lot of times there is an emphasis on fact that there aren t enough veterans working in VA  that particularly when it comes to some of the homeless issues that I think Secretary Nicholson sincerely wants to deal with it  it is much more effective if somebody who has been in the field is reaching out and can relate to some of the issues that some of these folks are going through     So I don t have clear answers right now in terms of what those opportunities are  but I would love to talk to you and other individuals that are interested  and one of the things that we might be able to do is set up some organizational structures or institutions here in the State working with the VSOs  working with the VA  to potentially do some of work   And it sounds like there may already be some systems that are in place  Secretary   Are you aware of      SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Yeah    SENATOR OBAMA      some mechanisms that we can plug in for persons like this young woman     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   Yeah   I would like to amplify that  because that is a very important question   In fact  you know  I am the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  and I consider it almost anything it affects a veteran  an affair of the veteran  and employment is certainly one of them     I have learned that among our age cohort of veterans of 20 to 24 years old  20 3 percent of them are unemployed   That s five times the national unemployment rate   That s unacceptable   These are people who signed up  did the training  performed their job in the military  got an honorable discharge  and one of five of them are unemployed     So I m taking steps   I have had a meeting now with people from the Department of Labor   I have gotten into the National Governors Association to commit to us that we are going have a big conference in Washington next month to develop a program to reach out to employers through the governors  through the major trade associations  and have them make an extra effort to find our veterans and to hire them   One  because they make great employees  and they ve gone through all of this stuff I ve told you  and two  because they deserve it   And if we can forge this linkage  I think we can make great strives in employing our veterans   Thank you     SENATOR OBAMA   Ms  Boise  I will have my staff get in touch with you after the meeting so we can make sure we get your contact information    MODERATOR PONCE   I m afraid this is going to have to be the last question   You know  I wish we had more time     This is from Andre Carter of Chicago  and the question   Mr  Secretary  what is going to come out of this meeting     SECRETARY NICHOLSON   I m glad you asked that question   Where is he   Because that s    I was hoping I would have a chance to summarize what is going to come out of this  because we are making ourselves available starting right now   Where are your people     AUDIENCE MEMBER   In the lobby    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   People are in that lobby now   If you want now to go and leave your name  social security number  talk to them  whatever you want to do today  they will stay there until the last person leaves   We are going to make a special mobilization commitment to review those of you that want to be reviewed   If you have new information  new claims that you want to make  we are going to make an extra effort to serve you here in      MODERATOR PONCE   Secretary    SECRETARY NICHOLSON   In Illinois   Thank you very much    MODERATOR PONCE   And I understand the Secretary is on a very tight schedule  but Senator Obama  Senator Durbin  we have very brief closing statements   SENATOR OBAMA   First  the only thing I want to say is I am so grateful to all the veterans for the great questions   They were all on point   Give yourselves a round of applause        Applause from the audience    SENATOR OBAMA   For those of you who are interested in staying and talking to our staff or the VA staff  just make sure myself and Senator Durbin will be around a little bit longer to talk to you and respond to some of your questions more directly     SENATOR DURBIN   I just want to say thank you   I also want to thank the Secretary   It wasn t easy for him to take these questions   He did it   You hold us accountable   We will hold him accountable  and we are all accountable to you   Let s make sure the veterans end up the winners   MODERATOR PONCE   As the meeting is breaking up real quickly  I would like to note some people who have not previously been           Inaudible remarks made by      Moderator Ponce  due to the      audience leaving      STATE OF ILLINOIS           SS   COUNTY OF DuPAGE       Lisa M  Grau  being

         Obama  Lugar Secure Funding for Implementation of Nonproliferation Law Thursday  June 28  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Ben LaBolt  Obama  or Andy Fisher  Lugar    48 million funding increase to be used to destroy conventional weapons stockpiles  intercept weapons of mass destruction and respond to proliferation emergencies  WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Richard Lugar  R IN  today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee accepted their request to provide funding to implement the Lugar Obama nonproliferation initiative   The Appropriations Committee expressed support for the initiative and provided  48 million for Lugar Obama   36 million for programs to destroy heavy conventional weapons   10 million for efforts to intercept weapons and materials of mass destruction  and  2 million for rapid response to proliferation detection and interdiction emergencies   This is the culmination of an 18 month effort to authorize and fund the Lugar Obama initiative  First introduced in November 2005 and enacted in 2007  the Lugar Obama initiative enhances U S  efforts to destroy conventional weapons stockpiles and to detect and interdict weapons and materials of mass destruction throughout the world        I applaud the decision to provide funding to implement the Lugar Obama initiative     a major step forward in addressing critical security challenges faced by the United States and our allies     said Senator Obama      Much of this funding will prevent conventional weapons from being used against our service members in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan and from falling into the hands of terrorists and fueling civil wars around the world   This funding will further strengthen our ability to detect and intercept illegal shipments of weapons and materials of mass destruction  enhancing efforts to prevent nuclear terrorism   I commend Senators Leahy and Gregg for their support on this critical issue          We believe that eliminating conventional weapons stockpiles and assisting other nations in detecting and interdicting weapons of mass destruction has been underfunded  fragmented and in need of high level support     Lugar said     For example  we want to ensure that our government has the capacity to deal quickly with vulnerable stockpiles of shoulder fired anti aircraft missiles  otherwise known as Man Portable Air Defense Systems  MANPADS   Such weapons could be used by terrorists to attack commercial airliners  military installations and government facilities here at home and abroad  Al Qaeda reportedly has attempted to acquire MANPADS on a number of occasions       The Lugar Obama initiative is modeled after the Nunn Lugar program that focuses on weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet Union  Lugar and former Senator Sam Nunn  D GA  authored the program in 1991  It has provided U S  funding and expertise to help the former Soviet Union safeguard and dismantle its enormous stockpiles of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons  related materials  and delivery systems  Among many accomplishments  the program has deactivated 7 000 nuclear warheads and reemployed 58 000 scientists in peaceful research  Ukraine  Belarus and Kazakhstan are nuclear weapons free as a result of cooperative efforts under the Nunn Lugar program  They otherwise would be the world s the third  fourth and eighth largest nuclear weapons powers  respectively   The Senate Appropriations Committee report language on the Lugar Obama initiative is as follows     Materials of Mass Destruction    The Committee supports sections 10 12 of Public Law 109 472 which strengthens U S  efforts to interdict illicit shipments of weapons or materials of mass destruction and secure vulnerable stockpiles of conventional weapons   The Committee provides  48 059 000 to implement these programs  of which  10 000 000 is under Export Control and Related Border Security Assistance   36 059 000 is under the Small Arms and Light Weapons Destruction program  and  2 000 000 is under the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund      Lugar and Obama traveled together to Russia  Ukraine and Azerbaijan in August 2005 to oversee a number of Nunn Lugar projects   Obama and Lugar introduced the legislation in November 2005    Operative sections of Lugar Obama became law in January 2007   Later in 2007  Lugar and Obama pressed the Appropriations Committee to provide funding for its implementation     Senators Obama and Lugar are members of the Foreign Relations Committee   Lugar serves as the Committee   s Ranking Member   Obama is Chairman of the European Affairs Subcommittee                                    ,Obama

  Obama Calls for Investigation of Long Term Care   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Calls for Investigation of Long Term Care Thursday  March 29  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact  Ben LaBolt  Requests GAO investigation following reports of a high number of rejected claims WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama today wrote a letter to the head of the Government Accountability Office calling for an investigation into long term care following a report in the New York Times of a high number of claims being denied  and practices that make it    difficult     if not impossible     for policyholders to get paid      A copy of the letter is below  The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General  U S  Government Accountability Office  441 G Street  NW  Washington  DC 20548 Dear Mr  Walker  A March 26  2007  article in the New York Times investigated the practices of several long term care insurers and reported a number of troubling findings about practices that    make it difficult     if not impossible     for policyholders to get paid      According to the article  nearly 1 in every 4 long term care claims in California was denied in 2005  Nearly 9 million long term care policies had been sold as of 2002  the most recent year for which data were available  with about 80 percent purchased through the individual market and the remaining 20 percent purchased through the group market   These products provide elderly Americans with coverage for care in their homes  assisted living facilities  and nursing homes   This range of services is critical for the health and financial well being of seniors  70 percent of whom will require long term care at some point in their lives  Long term care is a problem of national significance   As the baby boomers age  policymakers are struggling to design a long term care system that meets the needs of Americans with disabilities   While progress has been made  the long term care system is heavily biased towards institutional care  and the quality of care is often poor   Moreover  nursing home and home care are very expensive  and Medicare coverage for both is limited   As a result  catastrophic out of pocket expenses for nursing home and home care by American   s older people are routine  forcing many to rely on Medicaid to finance the care they need  The federal government has taken steps to promote the use of long term care insurance   The Long Term Care Partnership Program  a public private partnership between states and private insurance companies  is one such example   The Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program  sponsored by the Office of Personnel Management for federal employees  is a second example   In addition  the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act has profoundly shaped the long term care market by establishing standards regarding the characteristics of policies whose premiums can count towards the tax deduction available for health care costs that exceed 7 5 percent of income  I have a number of serious concerns about the long term care insurance market and its ability to fulfill its promise to its policyholders   First  I am concerned about the possible arbitrary denial of insurance benefits to seniors at their time of need   Second  I am concerned that some insurers may be enticing individuals to buy policies by offering low premiums  and then sharply increasing premiums if lapse rates are not as high as assumed in the premium calculations   Third  a substantial percentage of policies do not offer inflation adjustments  resulting in a significant erosion of purchasing power in later years   Even worse  some companies offer    inflation coverage    which allows policyholders to purchase additional coverage at a later date  but at the price charged older purchasers   Premiums increase dramatically by age  and individuals who elect to buy coverage later may not realize that such coverage will be extremely expensive  which may be financially infeasible  Given the role of the federal government in long term care financing  I request that GAO investigate these allegations and the adequacy of state and federal regulation   Specifically  I request that GAO review the practices of these insurers in order to assess the following    Rate of denial of claims  and as feasible  the extent to which denials were justifiable  Types of policies purchased  including the percentage of policies that do adjust and do not adjust for inflation and those that allow for purchase of additional coverage at a later date   Estimated loss of purchasing power for those individuals that have policies without inflation adjustment provisions   Frequency and amount of premium increases in already purchased policies  average lapse rates of policyholders  and the correlation between premium increases and lapse

  202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  September 22  2005 Obama  Coburn Hurricane Katrina Oversight Bill Passes Senate Committee Unanimously Obama Says Unanimous Committee Passage is First Step to Ensuring Financial Accountability   WASHINGTON   Legislation introduced by U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  designed to ensure financial integrity in the Hurricane Katrina relief and reconstruction effort passed the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs today by unanimous voice vote  Unanimous committee passage is a crucial first step in ensuring that the Oversight of Vital Emergency Recovery Spending Enhancement and Enforcement Act  OVERSEE  becomes law    Recently  Congress approved  62 billion for Gulf Coast relief and rebuilding efforts   most of which will go directly to FEMA   said Obama   This is twelve times the amount of money FEMA was given last year   more than it has ever been trusted to spend before  If FEMA s track record during the rescue effort and in years before is any indication of how they will perform during the rebuilding that lies ahead  this should concern every taxpayer and every citizen interested in helping the millions of Americans who have been devastated by Hurricane Katrina     Previous rebuilding efforts involving FEMA and other government agencies have a history of fraud  corruption  and waste when there is no oversight or accountability in how the funds are spent  Following Hurricane Frances in 2004  FEMA awarded  30 million and approved more than 12 000 claims for residents of Miami Dade County  The storm  however  made landfall 100 miles north and Miami Dade never even saw hurricane force winds    The Coburn Obama bill would create a Chief Financial Officer  CFO  to oversee all expenditures associated with the Hurricane Katrina relief and reconstruction effort  The Hurricane Katrina CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  staffed with experts from relevant federal agencies  and would have management and oversight over any agency using federal funds for the recovery  The CFO would issue monthly financial reports to Congress  and the Government Accountability Office would issue quarterly reports to Congress reviewing the work of the CFO and recovery activities    As we look towards the massive Gulf Coast rebuilding efforts ahead  we must demand accountability over how the billions of dollars we ve given to FEMA are spent   said Obama   The CFO will also specifically look at whether federal funds are going to people most in need  whether federal funds are going to companies that hire local workers  and the extent to which the federal government is using no bid and  cost plus  contracts  As you ll recall  these contracts are what caused the whole contracting mess in Iraq     Even if the levees hadn t burst and New Orleans didn t flood  Hurricane Katrina would still be the largest natural disaster this country has ever faced  and the rebuilding effort will be certainly be the largest and costliest of its kind  This entrusts FEMA with a massive amount of responsibility  and so it s only right that we protect both taxpayers and citizens on the Gulf Coast with strict accountability and oversight about how the money is being spent and whether it s being most efficiently directed to helping people rebuild their lives  I believe the bill s unanimous passage by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs shows our commitment to financial accountability in these rebuilding efforts  and is an important first step in creating a CFO who will help ensure our tax dollars aren t wasted    SUMMARY OF COBURN OBAMA  OVERSEE ACT   A Chief Financial Officer  CFO  would be established and would be responsible for the efficient and effective use of federal funds in all activities relating to the recovery from Hurricane Katrina  Unlike an IG which audits money after it has been spent  the CFO would review expenditures before they are approved  This is a better way to protect against waste  fraud  and abuse  The CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  and located in the Executive Office of the President  The CFO office would be staffed with experts detailed from relevant federal agencies  would have management and oversight of each federal agency involved in the recovery effort  and would work in conjunction with the inspectors general in each of these agencies   Every month  the CFO would issue financial reports to Congress on the use of federal funds  These reports would include information about the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to persons most in need  the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to companies that hire local workers  and the use of no bid and  cost plus  contracts  The Government Accountability Office  GAO  would issue quarterly reports reviewing the activities and expenses approved by the CFO  These reports would examine the accuracy of the CFO s reports and include information on the use of no bid or  cost plus  contracts  whether federal funds have been used for their intended purposes  and the extent to which federal funds have helped persons most in need and local workers                                    ,Obama

  Obama  Culture in Washington Must Change  Implement Tough Ethics Reform   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama  Culture in Washington Must Change  Implement Tough Ethics Reform Thursday  August  2  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    CONTACT  Ben LaBolt WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today delivered the following remarks on the Senate floor in support of the Honest Government and Leadership Act   This legislation would provide increased transparency and accountability  reduce the influence of lobbyists and special interests  and bring about the concrete changes we need in Washington   In January  Obama joined with Senator Russ Feingold  D WI  to introduce Lobbying and Ethics Reform Act  which set a standard for strong ethics legislation this Congress   Obama also sponsored an amendment to the Honest Government and Open Leadership Act that required the disclosure of lobbyists that bundle campaign contributions for candidates  Senator Obama  s remarks are below    First  let me commend Senator Reid for his leadership on this bill and especially my good friend Senator Feingold  who I have worked closely with on this issue over the past year and a half          The bill that  s before us today could not be more urgently needed   For too long  the American people have seen lobbyists treat the legislative process like a game  using targeted contributions to maximize their leverage   For too long  people have felt like their voice and their interests have been drowning in a sea of lobbyist money in Washington         This is not the first time we have faced a crisis of confidence in government  Around the turn of the last century  wealth was becoming more concentrated in the hands of a few robber barons  railroad tycoons and oil magnates   It was an era known as the Gilded Age  and it was made possible by a government that played along        But when President Theodore Roosevelt took office  he wouldn  t play along   He devoted his presidency to busting trusts  breaking up monopolies  and doing his best to give the American people a shot at the American dream once more        America needs this kind of leadership more than ever   We need leadership that sees government not as a tool to enrich well connected friends and high priced lobbyists  but as the defender of fairness and opportunity for every American         We cannot settle for a second Gilded Age in America   And yet we find ourselves once more in the midst of a new economy where more wealth is in danger of falling into fewer hands  where CEO pay grows from year to year as the average worker  s pay remains stagnant  where Americans are struggling like never before to pay their medical bills  or their kids   tuition  or high gas prices  all while the profits of the drug and insurance and oil industries have never been higher       And once again  we are faced with a politics that makes all of this possible   In recent years  the doors of Congress and the White House have been thrown wide open to an army of Washington lobbyists who have turned our government into a game only they can afford to play  Year after year after year  they stand in the way of our progress as a country   They stop us from addressing the issues that matter most to our people        Take health care   The drug and insurance industries spent  1 billion in lobbying over the last decade   They got what they paid for when their friends in Congress broke the rules and twisted arms to push through a prescription drug bill that actually made it illegal for our own government to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies for cheaper drug prices        And because reform has been blocked up to now  there are parents and grandparents in this country who are walking into a drugstore and wondering how their Social Security check is going to cover a prescription that  s more expensive than it was a month ago  those who are being forced to choose between their medicine and their groceries because they can no longer afford both          Let me be clear  I do not begrudge businesses for trying to make a profit  and I do not begrudge them for hiring lobbyists to plead their case before Congress   It is protected political speech  and we appreciate that there are many lobbyists who represent their clients well and fairly  But it  s time we had a Congress that tells the drug companies and the oil companies and the insurance industry that while they may get a seat at the table in Washington  they don  t get to buy every chair        We need to put an end to the prevailing culture in this town   And that  s what we  ve been trying to do for the past couple of years   Last year  Congress came up with a watered down version of reform   Last year  I and Senator Feingold and Senator McCain  voted against it because we thought we could do better   So in January  I came back with Senator Feingold and we set a high bar for reform   And I  m pleased to report that the bill before us today comes very close to what we proposed        By passing this bill  we will ban gifts and meals and end subsidized travel on corporate jets   We will close the revolving door between Pennsylvania Avenue and K Street   And we will make sure that the American people could see all the pet projects that lawmakers are trying to pass before they are actually voted on         And we  ll do something more   Over the objections of powerful voices in both parties  we  ll ensure that our laws shine a bright light on how lobbyists help fill the campaign coffers of members of Congress by bundling contributions from others   Because in an era in which soft money is prohibited  the real measure of a lobbyist  s influence isn  t how much money he  s contributed  it  s how much he  s raised from others       For too long  this practice has been hidden from public view   But today  we can change that   I  m pleased that the amendment I  ve offered on bundling is part of this bill  and I want to thank Rep  Chris Van Hollen who has fought so hard to get this provision included in the House bill  As the Washington Post described the bundling provision earlier this year     No single change would add more to public understanding of how money really operates in Washington         So there  s a lot of good in this bill  and I truly hope and believe that it will change the way we do business in Washington   Let  s not forget that there  s more we need to do       One of the things I  ve argued is the necessity of an independent entity to enforce ethics rules in Congress   Because no matter how well we police our own conduct  so long as we  re our own prosecutor  judge  and jury  the public will never have complete trust in our decisions   So far  that  s a fight I  ve lost  but I  ll continue to support independent enforcement because I believe it  s in our nation  s best interests         I also believe that if we  re serious about change  we need to have a real discussion about public financing for congressional elections   Because even if we can stop lobbyists from buying us lunch or taking us out on junkets  they  ll still be able to attend our fundraisers    and that  s access the average American doesn  t have        In our democracy  the price of access and influence should be nothing more than your voice and your vote   That should be enough for health care reform   That should be enough for a real energy policy   That should be enough to ensure that our government is still the defender of fairness and opportunity for every American         It  s time to show the American people that we have the courage to change the prevailing culture in this city   It  s time to give people confidence in their government again  And we have the chance to start doing that with this bill   So I proudly support this legislation

the Senate floor to call for the expansion of the Children   s Health Insurance Program  CHIP    As more Americans lose their health insurance everyday  CHIP has provided 6 million uninsured children with the health care they need  and encouraged states like Illinois to build on its success and expand health coverage even further   The reauthorization bill before the Senate would expand coverage to reach an additional 3 2 million children  Obama   s remarks  as prepared for delivery  are below     As I   ve traveled across this country over the last few years  there are fewer issues that show a greater disconnect between what the American people want and the way Washington works than health care          Every year people put it at the very top of their list of concerns   Every year more people lose their insurance  or watch their premiums skyrocket  or open up medical bills that they just can   t pay          And yet  whenever the issue actually comes up in Washington  they watch health care debates play out that are filled with half truths and scare tactics   They see insurance companies run ads telling folks they   ll lose their doctor or wait forever if universal health care is passed          They watch the industry spend billions on lobbyists who use undue influence to block much needed reform   And at the end of the day  nothing gets done  and we move on to fight about something else          To most Americans  we seem completely disconnected from the reality that they   re living every day   Especially when we have a President who actually said     I mean  people have access to health care in America   After all  you just go to an emergency room             That   s what passes for universal health care in the greatest  wealthiest country on Earth     overcrowded  understaffed Emergency Rooms that raise everyone   s premiums and cost taxpayers more money          It   s shameful   And what   s even more shameful is that nine million of the Americans who are forced to wait in Emergency Rooms when they get sick     who have no health insurance at all     are children          Children who did not choose where they were born or how much money their parents have   Children whose development depends on the care and nourishment they receive in those early years   Children who any parent  anywhere  should want to protect at any cost          Now  we can shade the truth and pretend there are only one million uninsured like the President says   We can make excuses for this neglect or we can just ignore it altogether  but as long as there are nine million children in the United States of America with no health insurance  it is a betrayal of the ideals we hold as Americans          It   s not who we are  and today is our chance to prove it          We know that CHIP works   Because of CHIP  6 million children who   d otherwise be uninsured have health care today   Because of CHIP  millions of children are protected when their parents lose their health care          Because of CHIP  individual states like my home state of Illinois are building on its success to expand health coverage even further   And because of CHIP  millions of children with asthma  traumatic injuries  and mental health conditions  are able to see a doctor and get the treatment they need           Even though the uninsured rate among low income children fell by more than one third in the years after CHIP was enacted  the trend reversed two years ago   And since then  we   ve seen growing numbers of uninsured children          Uninsured children are twice as likely as insured children to miss out on needed medical care  including doctor visits and checkups          One quarter of uninsured children don   t get any medical care at all   And those who do  get lower quality care   Even with the same illnesses and conditions  whether it   s an ear infection or appendicitis  studies have found that uninsured children get different treatment  and often suffer more as a result   One study even found that uninsured children who are admitted to a hospital with injuries are twice as likely to die there as children who do have insurance          And to put this problem in the larger context  we know that when a child gets sick and can   t get treated     or receives inadequate treatment     he misses more days of school   And when he misses more school days  he begins to do worse relative to his peers   And that can have long term consequences on his chances in life   That   s not something I   d want for either of my two young daughters or for any other American child         So let   s get serious and solve this problem   Let   s reauthorize CHIP   Let   s make sure that the 6 million children who are now covered through the program continue to be covered     and let   s extend coverage to an additional 3 2 million uninsured children         But we also know that the question of children   s health care is tied to the larger question of universal care in this country  Because we know that when we cover parents  we also cover children   And that   s something we   ve seen in Illinois   When I was a State Senator  I was able to help extend health care coverage to an additional 150 000 parents and their children   So if we   re serious about covering every child  we have to cover every parent as well          The American people have been waiting for us to act on health care for far too long   And starting by covering more children should not be a difficult issue to agree on                                         ,Obama

         Obama Joins Senators to Call for Investigation of PBCG Pension Payments Wednesday  July  2  2008  For Immediate Release  Contacts  Meghan Dubyak  Brown  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  Senators Cite Cases in Which Pension Beneficiaries Have Been Asked to Repay Thousands of Dollars in Benefits to PBGC   WASHINGTON  D C    Thirteen U S  Senators today called for an investigation of how the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  PBGC  calculates payments when it assumes responsibility for private pensions  The Senators cited several examples in which retirees have been asked to pay back thousands of dollars worth of overpayments that resulted from incorrect PBGC pension estimates   Retirees should be able to count on a reliable source of income   said Senator Brown  who led the letter requesting the GAO investigation   Individuals living on fixed incomes should not suffer when PBGC s initial estimates are way off or there are unjustifiable delays in finalizing pension payments    Retired folks depend on their pensions to make ends meet  and information gathered by the GAO will help to ensure that seniors can depend on PBGC to get their payments right   said Senator Baucus   Particularly in this turbulent economy  retirees deserve the peace of mind in knowing they will not receive sharp and sudden cuts in their pension benefits because of bureaucratic delays   Senator Bayh said   We have a responsibility to our seniors to take a comprehensive look at the procedures that this congressionally chartered entity utilizes to ensure fair and timely benefit calculations    More than two million Pennsylvanians have their pensions insured by the PBGC   said Senator Casey    Every step must be taken to ensure they receive the correct benefit from PCGC    For seniors and retirees who worked hard for many years and now depend on pensions  reliability is essential  They deserve a transparent and predictable payment process  not the fear that their expected income might suddenly disappear because of a bureaucratic error   Senator Clinton said   I urge PBGC to investigate these troubling reports and make the necessary improvements  Our retirees have earned a system that works     Millions of Americans rely on their pensions to make retirement comfortable and secure and PBGC has a responsibility to provide timely and accurate payments   Senator Durbin said   Miscalculations have resulted in real hardship for America s retirees and we need to get to the bottom of it  I hope this study will allow problems to be identified so that they can be promptly addressed and corrected       An independent assessment by the Government Accountability Office is part of an overall review of how the PBGC makes important calculations  Congress needs to make sure administrative actions by the PBGC don t make things worse for pensioners who are already in a tough situation   Senator Grassley said   The PBGC is responsible for protecting the pensions of millions of Americans and we in Congress are responsible for watching over the PBGC  I am proud to join my colleagues to request this study to help the PBGC better serve the retirees whose pensions they are responsible for   said Senator Mikulski  who chairs the HELP Committee s Retirement and Aging Subcommittee   I know first hand how workers and retirees can be hurt when a factory closes  because it happened to thousands of my constituents at Bethlehem Steel in Baltimore  I will always fight for these hard working men and women and their families to protect what they worked so hard to build    Americans deserve to retire with a stable income  health care benefits and retirement security   said Senator Obama   We must ensure that these retirees are not burdened with unfair and erroneous costs as a result of inaccurate PBGC estimates  I urge the GAO to immediately examine any miscalculations in this process   The pensions of more than 44 million private sector workers and retirees are insured by the PBGC  PBGC is responsible for collecting premiums from plan sponsors and for providing timely and uninterrupted pension payments if plan sponsors file for bankruptcy or terminate plans   When PBGC assumes responsibility for payments  it initially pays a retiree an estimated benefit until it calculates the final amount that beneficiary will receive  However  it often takes PBGC several years to calculate the final benefit amount  When the final benefit amount is lower than the estimated payment  not only do PBGC beneficiaries begin receiving lower pension payments  but they must return the overpayment accrued over time  This often results in financial hardship for retirees living on fixed incomes  The Senators have requested that GAO study several aspects of PBGC performance to determine how its benefit determination process could be improved  Specifically  they requested that GAO    Explain how PBGC estimates initial benefits Determine why there have been noted delays in making final benefit determinations Examine the extent to which retiree benefits change significantly when they become final and the reasons for these changes Examine the discrepancies between negotiated and guaranteed benefits for those retirees whose benefit plans have come under PBGC administration due to plan termination Examine how the PBGC appeals process functions  including the ease of participant access to the process and the length of time that passes awaiting decision    A copy of the letter is below  July 1  2008  Gene Dodaro  Acting Comptroller General  U S  Government Accountability Office  441 G Street  N W   Washington  DC 20548  Dear Mr  Dodaro    We are writing to request a GAO assessment of the process by which the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  PBGC  estimates retiree benefits for corporations that it insures  We are concerned about the impact this process has on pension recipients who have suffered lost paychecks  health benefits  and retirement security in the face of economic volatility and outsourcing   The PBGC protects the pensions of more than 44 million private sector workers and retirees in over 30 000 employer sponsored defined benefit pension plans  PBGC s primary responsibility is to collect premiums from plan sponsors and to provide timely and uninterrupted benefit payments when terminations or bankruptcies occur  In the event of plan terminations  PBGC assumes control of plan assets  calculates benefit amounts  and pays recipients a guaranteed benefit  PBGC initially pays retirees an estimated benefit without interruption  but routinely takes several years to calculate the final benefit amount  At times  the final benefit amount is significantly different than initially estimated  In these cases  recipients may face a considerable decrease in monthly payments and may also be forced to pay back overpayments  creating significant financial hardship   The most recent example concerns employees of Republic Technologies International  RTI   a steel company that declared bankruptcy in 2001 and terminated its pension plans for employees in Ohio  Illinois  Indiana  New York  and Pennsylvania in 2002  Although PBGC assumed immediate control of the terminated RTI pension plan  final benefit determinations were not made until this past spring   almost 6 years later  RTI retirees now face significant decreases in monthly benefit payments  some of up to 70 percent  These benefit reductions are compounded by a recoupment policy that has left many retirees in debt to PBGC  some up to  75 000  In light of these circumstances  we are requesting that GAO study several aspects of PBGC performance to determine how its benefit determination process can be improved  Specifically  we would like GAO to determine  1  how PBGC estimates initial benefits  2  why there have been noted instances in which there have been delays in making final benefit determinations  3  to examine the extent to which retiree benefits change significantly when they become final and the reasons for these changes  4  to examine the discrepancies between negotiated and guaranteed benefits for those retirees whose benefit plans have come under PBGC administration due to plan termination  and 5  to examine how the PBGC appeals process functions  including the ease of participant access to the process and the length of time that passes awaiting decision  We would also welcome GAO s recommendations for ways to mitigate any negative impact of PBGC processes on retires and to make benefit determination faster and more accurate  thus improving the service PBGC provides  Thank you for your cooperation in addressing these matters   Please contact Cathy Zebrowski in Senator Brown s office at 224 0719 if you have any questions    Sincerely    Senator Max Baucus Senator Evan Bayh Senator Sherrod Brown Senator Richard Burr Senator Robert P  Casey Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Senator Richard Durbin Senator Mike Enzi Senator Chuck Grassley Senator Edward Kennedy Senator Barbara Mikulski Senator Barack Obama Senator Arlen Specter

Andy Fisher  andy_fisher foreign senate gov   202  224 2079  Date  May 23  2006   Lugar Obama Bill to Keep Weapons Out of Terrorists  Hands Heads to Senate Floor Bipartisan Effort Focuses on Antiaircraft Missiles  Stolen WMDs and Conventional Weapons used in Improvised Roadside Bombs   WASHINGTON   The U S  Senate Foreign Relations Committee today passed out of committee  S  2566  the Lugar Obama Act   Modeled after the Nunn Lugar program that focuses on weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet Union  the bill was introduced by Sens  Dick Lugar  R IN  and Barack Obama  D IL  to expand the cooperative threat reduction concept to conventional weapons     Lugar Obama would expand the detection and interdiction of weapons and materials of mass destruction    A full list of the legislation  nominations and treaties passed out of committee and headed to the Senate floor is available at      The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the number one national security threat that confronts the United States today   Under Senator Lugar s leadership  the Nunn Lugar program has safely disposed of literally thousands of weapons of mass destruction which  had they fallen into the wrong hands  could have been used against America with catastrophic results   The Lugar Obama bill will build on this success by helping other nations find and eliminate conventional weapons that have been used against our own soldiers in Iraq and sought by terrorists all over the world   said Obama      We are convinced that the United States can and should do more to eliminate conventional weapons stockpiles and assist other nations in detecting and interdicting weapons of mass destruction   We believe that these functions are underfunded  fragmented and in need of high level support   Lugar said     We are particularly concerned that our government has the capacity to deal quickly with vulnerable stockpiles of shoulder fired anti aircraft missiles  known as MANPADS   In recent years  concerns have grown that such weapons could be used by terrorists to attack commercial airliners  military installations  and government facilities here at home and abroad   Al Qaeda reportedly has attempted to acquire MANPADS on a number of occasions   said Lugar    The first part of the Lugar Obama legislation would energize the U S  program against unsecured lightweight anti aircraft missiles and other conventional weapons   There may be as many as 750 000 man portable air defense systems in arsenals worldwide  and the State Department estimates that more than 40 civilian aircraft have been hit by such weapons since the 1970s   In addition  loose stocks of small arms and other weapons help fuel civil wars in Africa and elsewhere and provide the means for attacks on peacekeepers and aid workers seeking to stabilize war torn societies   In Iraq  unsecured stockpiles of artillery shells and ammunition have been reconfigured into improvised explosive devices  IEDs  that have become the insurgents  most effective weapon     The second part of Lugar Obama would strengthen the ability of America s allies to detect and interdict illegal shipments of weapons and materials of mass destruction   U S  security depends not just on the willingness of other nations to help  it depends on whether they have the capabilities to be effective   The State Department engages in several related anti terrorism and export control assistance programs   But these programs are focused on other stages of the threat  not on detection and interdiction  and create a gap in our defenses that needs to be filled    The Lugar Obama bill would increase by  25 million funding available for the elimination of conventional weapons and MANPADS and by  50 million funding to assist countries in improving their ability to detect and interdict materials and weapons of mass destruction   This offers a potent but flexible tool to build a robust international network to stop proliferation     Lugar and Obama traveled together to Russia  Ukraine and Azerbaijan in August to oversee a number of Nunn Lugar projects   In Ukraine they saw a conventional weapons facility that is typical of the focus of the new legislation    In 1991  Senator Lugar  R IN  and former Senator Sam Nunn  D GA  authored the Nunn Lugar Act  which established the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program  This program has provided U S  funding and expertise to help the former Soviet Union safeguard and dismantle its enormous stockpiles of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons  related materials  and delivery systems  In 1997  Lugar and Nunn were joined by Senator Pete Domenici  R NM  in introducing the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act  which expanded Nunn Lugar authorities in the former Soviet Union and provided WMD expertise to first responders in American cities  In 2003  Congress adopted the Nunn Lugar Expansion Act  which authorized the Nunn Lugar program to operate outside the former Soviet Union to address proliferation threats  In October 2004  Nunn Lugar funds were used for the first time outside of the former Soviet Union to secure chemical weapons in Albania  under a Lugar led expansion of the program    The latest Nunn Lugar Scorecard shows that the program has deactivated or destroyed  6 828 nuclear warheads  611 ICBMs  485 ICBM silos  55 ICBM mobile missile launchers  152 bombers  865 nuclear air to surface missiles  436 submarine missile launchers  563 submarine launched missiles  29 nuclear submarines  and 194 nuclear test tunnels    Beyond the scorecard s nuclear elimination  the Nunn Lugar program secures and destroys chemical weapons  and works to reemploy scientists and facilities related to biological weapons in peaceful research initiatives  The International Science and Technology Centers  of which the United States is the leading sponsor  have engaged 58 000 former weapons scientists in peaceful work

Obama wrote that will provide a 30  tax credit up to  30 000 for the construction of E85 ethanol pumps  Experts estimate this provision will triple of the number of fueling stations that offer E85 in

000 claims for the program have been filed by workers in Illinois  only 849 have been paid   As a result  hundreds of claimants have been waiting more than 7 years to receive a decision on their claims    After a recent constituent inquiry as to the costs of administering the program during this delay  Obama called on the agencies to provide the figures associated with processing both Illinois and nationwide claims in order to examine how much these delays are costing taxpayers   Since 2005  Obama has actively advocated on behalf of these Illinoisans  claims  and worked to move the process forward     As hundreds of former employees of Blockson Chemical  General Steel Industries  and Dow Chemical wait to hear their claim decisions  these Illinoisans deserve to know how much this

                               Senators Laud Energy Security Leadership Council Call for Increase in Fuel Economy Standards Wednesday  December 13  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama contact  Tommy

Standards Plan Echoes Senators  Bipartisan Legislation to Increase Fuel Economy Standards   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Dick Lugar  R IN   and Joe Biden  D DE  today praised the Energy Security Leadership Council for recommending that the United States greatly reduce its dependence on foreign oil by enacting a proposal to increase fuel economy standards that is nearly identical to legislation they introduced in July  Senators Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Tom Harkin  D IA   Norm Coleman  R MN   Dick Durbin  D IL   Gordon Smith  R OR   Arlen Specter  R PA   Maria Cantwell  D WA  and Chuck Schumer  D NY  are also cosponsors of the legislation    The Energy Security Leadership Council is an effort by a collection of prominent business leaders and retired senior military officers to build support for a comprehensive  long term policy to reduce U S  oil dependence and improve energy security  To read a copy of the report  visit this website  http   www secureenergy org     The true danger of America s dependence on foreign oil is best explained by enemies like Al Qaeda  who have said that oil      is the umbilical cord and lifeline of the crusader community    Obama said    It is clear that the Achilles heel of the most powerful country on earth is the oil we import and cannot live without  and that is why we must increase the fuel efficiency of our cars with technology we already have on the shelf       Leadership by private industry  the military  and across sectors and levels of government is an essential component in making meaningful progress   Lugar said   I m pleased that the Council and SAFE have made an important contribution to our ongoing policy debate   Increasing fuel economy is one facet of a comprehensive energy strategy that the United States must adopt in the interest of our national security      If it was not clear before  it is now  Domestic energy policy is at the center of our foreign policy   said Senator Joseph R  Biden   For our national security we have to begin the transition to alternative fuels  We can t do that without making progress on fuel economy by upgrading to a better system that combines protection for U S  automobile manufacturing jobs with predictable increases in fuel efficiency standards for cars  SUVs and light trucks       The bipartisan legislation  the Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2006  seeks to break the decades long logjam on increasing fuel economy standards by taking a new  more flexible approach  The bill charges the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration  NHTSA  to create regular annual increases in fuel economy with a target of approximately 1 mile per gallon each year  The experts at NHTSA will base these standards on attributes of a vehicle such as size and weight  and will be able to revise the annual increase if they conclude that the target cannot be reached with current technology or without compromising the safety of the entire fleet  or is not cost effective when compared to the economic and geopolitical value of a gallon of gasoline saved    This legislation flips the current debate about increasing fuel economy standards on its head  from a debate about whether standards will be raised to presumption that they will be raised    In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop more fuel efficient vehicles  the legislation also provides generous tax incentives for companies to retool parts and assembly plants  This would strengthen the U S  auto industry by allowing them to compete with foreign hybrid  E 85 and other fuel efficient vehicles  The bill would also allow more Americans to benefit from a tax credit for the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles by lifting the current cap that only makes eligible the first 60 000 buyers per manufacturer each year    If this 4 percent per year improvement is maintained for 20 years  this bill would reduce gasoline consumption by 549 billion gallons  If gasoline were just  2 50 per gallon  consumers would save  1 372 trillion at the pump by 2028    The Fuel Economy Reform Act would also provide fairness and flexibility to domestic automakers by establishing different standards for different types of cars  Currently  manufacturers have to meet broad standards over their whole fleet of cars  This disadvantages companies like Ford and General Motors that produce full lines of small and large cars and trucks rather than manufacturers that only sell small cars                                     ,Obama

Debunked Insight Magazine and Fox News Smear Campaign Tuesday  January 23  2007  Contact  Tommy Vietor or Robert Gibbs  202 228 5511  Date  January 23  2007  Debunked Insight Magazine and Fox News Smear Campaign In the past week  many of you have read a now thoroughly debunked story by Insight Magazine  owned by the Washington Times  which cites unnamed sources close to a political campaign that claim Senator Obama was enrolled for    at least four years    in an Indonesian    Madrassa     The article says the    sources    believe the Madrassa was    espousing Wahhabism     a form of radical Islam  Insight Magazine published these allegations without a single named source  and without doing any independent reporting to confirm or deny the allegations  Fox News quickly parroted the charges  and Fox and Friends host Steve Doocy went so far as to ask     Why didn   t anybody ever mention that that man right there was raised     spent the first decade of his life  raised by his Muslim father     as a Muslim and was educated in a Madrassa     All of the claims about Senator Obama raised in the Insight Magazine piece were thoroughly debunked by CNN  which  instead of relying on unnamed sources  sent a reporter to Obama   s former school in Jakarta to check the facts    Video   If Doocy or the staff at Fox and Friends had taken the time to check their facts  or simply made a call to his office  they would have learned that Senator Obama was not educated in a Madrassa  was not raised as a Muslim  and was not raised by his father     an atheist Obama met once in his life before he died  Later in the day  Fox News host John Gibson again discussed the Insight Magazine story without any attempt to independently confirm the charges  All of the claims about Senator Obama   s faith and education raised in the Insight Magazine story and repeated on Fox News are false  Senator Obama was raised in a secular household in Indonesia by his stepfather and mother  Obama   s stepfather worked for a U S  oil company  and sent his stepson to two years of Catholic school  as well as two years of public school  As Obama described it     Without the money to go to the international school that most expatriate children attended  I went to local Indonesian schools and ran the streets with the children of farmers  servants  tailors  and clerks      The Audacity of Hope  p  274  To be clear  Senator Obama has never been a Muslim  was not raised a Muslim  and is a committed Christian who attends the United Church of Christ in Chicago  Furthermore  the Indonesian school Obama attended in Jakarta is a public school that is not and never has been a Madrassa  These malicious  irresponsible charges are precisely the kind of politics the American people have grown tired of  and that Senator Obama is trying to change by focusing on bringing people together to solve our common problems  Below please find facts and citations rebutting the claims in the Insight

classmate calls school  general   with multiple religions JAKARTA  Indonesia  CNN     Allegations that Sen  Barack Obama was educated in a radical Muslim school known as a  madrassa  are not accurate  according to CNN reporting  Insight Magazine  which is owned by the same company as The Washington Times  reported on its Web site last week that associates of Sen  Hillary Rodham Clinton  D New York  had unearthed information the Illinois Democrat and likely presidential candidate attended a Muslim religious school known for teaching the most fundamentalist form of Islam  Obama lived in Indonesia as a child  from 1967 to 1971  with his mother and stepfather and has acknowledged attending a Muslim school  but an aide said it was not a madrassa   Watch video of Obama s school  Insight attributed the information in its article to an unnamed source  who said it was discovered by  researchers connected to Senator Clinton   A spokesman for Clinton  who is also weighing a White House bid  denied that the campaign was the source of the Obama claim  He called the story  an obvious right wing hit job   Insight stood by its story in a response posted on its Web site Monday afternoon  The Insight article was cited several times Friday on Fox News and was also referenced by the New York Post  The Glenn Beck program on CNN Headline News and a number of political blogs   Watch how the Obama  gossip  spread  School not a madrassa But reporting by CNN in Jakarta  Indonesia and Washington  D C   shows the allegations that Obama attended a madrassa to be false  CNN dispatched Senior International Correspondent John Vause to Jakarta to investigate  He visited the Basuki school  which Obama attended from 1969 to 1971   This is a public school  We don t focus on religion   Hardi Priyono  deputy headmaster of the Basuki school  told Vause   In our daily lives  we try to respect religion  but we don t give preferential treatment   Vause reported he saw boys and girls dressed in neat school uniforms playing outside the school  while teachers were dressed in Western style clothes   I came here to Barack Obama s elementary school in Jakarta looking for what some are calling an Islamic madrassa     like the ones that teach hate and violence in Pakistan and Afghanistan   Vause said on the  Situation Room  Monday   I ve been to those madrassas in Pakistan     this school is nothing like that   Vause also interviewed one of Obama s Basuki classmates  Bandug Winadijanto  who claims that not a lot has changed at the school since the two men were pupils  Insight reported that Obama s political opponents believed the school promoted Wahhabism  a fundamentalist form of Islam   and are seeking to prove it    It s not  an  Islamic school  It s general   Winadijanto said   There is a lot of Christians  Buddhists  also Confucian      So that s a mixed school   The Obama aide described Fox News  broadcasting of the Insight story  appallingly irresponsible   Fox News executive Bill Shine told CNN  Reliable Sources  anchor Howard Kurtz that some of the network s hosts were simply expressing their opinions and repeatedly cited Insight as the source of the

Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Richard Lugar  R IN  Friday said that they have introduced comprehensive legislation that will use alternative fuel technologies to greatly decrease America s dependence on foreign oil     For all of our military might and economic dominance  the Achilles  heel of the most powerful country on Earth is still the oil we cannot live without   said Obama   I could give you all plenty of reasons why it s a good idea for this country to move away from an oil based economy  but all we really need to know about the danger of our oil addiction comes directly from words spoken by Osama bin Laden   Focus your operations on oil  especially in Iraq and the Gulf area  since this will cause them to die off  on their own       Obama and Lugar s bipartisan legislation  the American Fuels Act of 2006  S  2446   would take a four step approach to reducing America s dependence on foreign oil  First  the legislation would spur investment in alternative fuels by increasing the production of cellulosic biomass ethanol  CBE  to 250 million gallons by 2012  It would also create an Alternative Diesel Standard that will require 2 billion gallons of alternatives diesels be mixed into the 40 billion gallon annual national diesel pool by 2015  This proposal is modeled of the Renewable Fuels Standard  which has proved successful in increasing ethanol production and use    Second  the legislation would help increase consumer demand for alternative fuels by providing a short term  35 cents per gallon tax credit for E85 fuel and by providing automakers with a  100 tax credit for every E85 capable Flexible Fuel Vehicle  FFV  produced    Third  it would require the U S  government to lead by example and increase access to alternative fuels by requiring the government to allow public access to alternative fueling stations located on federal government property and by requiring that only clean buses be eligible for federal cost sharing  It would also create establish a Department of Defense  fly off competition  that would encourage private sector companies to compete to find the most energy efficient alternatives fuels for defense purposes    Finally  the legislation would create a Director of Energy Security to oversee and keep America focused on its goal of energy independence  The Director of Energy Security would serve as the principal advisor to the President  the National Security Council  the National Economic Council and the Homeland Security Council     This bill will help tilt our energy balance toward alternative fuels  moving these fuels into additional markets and making them more widely available for consumers   said Lugar   We believe that U S  national security will be served by more robust coordination of all the elements that contribute to energy security  Consequently  the bill also would establish the post of Director of Energy Security  who would answer to the President  Our policies should be targeted to replace hydrocarbons with carbohydrates  Obviously this is not a short term proposition  but we can off set a significant portion of demand for oil by giving American consumers a real choice of automotive fuel  We must end oil s near monopoly on the transportation sector  which accounts for 60 percent of American oil consumption  I am pleased to join Sen  Obama in promoting this legislation and appreciate his initiative in drafting it     Senator Obama said that while the reforms he and Senator Lugar have proposed will require sacrifice  they are attainable if America truly commits to the goal of energy independence    The President was absolutely correct when he said America is addicted to oil  but we can t continue to settle for piecemeal  bite sized solutions to our energy crisis   said Obama    We need a national commitment to energy security  Now is the time for serious leadership to get us started down the path of energy independence   The ideas Senator Lugar and I have proposed are bipartisan and common sense and would take an enormous step towards energy independence     Senator Richard Lugar is Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  Senator Obama is also a member of the Foreign Relations Committee as well as the Environment and Public Works Committee                                    ,Obama

2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      CONTACT  Amy Brundage  OBAMA  or Max Gleischman  DURBIN  Blackwater May Have Misclassified Workers  Cheated American Taxpayers WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent a letter to U S  Treasury Secretary Henry M  Paulson asking for a full investigation and audit of how Blackwater USA classifies its workers  Initial investigations into this issue by House Oversight Committee Chairman Henry Waxman suggest that Blackwater has classified workers as independent contractors so as to avoid paying payroll taxes  which could deprive taxpayers of millions of dollars and shortchange employees by denying them overtime pay and workers  compensation  In September  Senators Obama and Durbin  along with Senators Kennedy and Murray  introduced S 2044  The Independent Contractor Proper Classification Act of 2007  which will close a tax loophole that allows employers to classify a worker an  independent contractor  instead of an  employee  to avoid paying employment taxes and workers compensation for their workers   It will also encourage improved enforcement of existing tax and labor laws related to worker misclassification through strengthened coordination between the Departments of Labor and Treasury  improved access to information for workers  and by establishing the right of workers to challenge their classification without fear of employer retaliation    The text of the letter is below  Dear Secretary Paulson  We are writing to ask for a full investigation and audit of Blackwater USA s practice of classifying many of its personnel as independent contractors instead of employees   As House Oversight Committee Chairman Henry Waxman recently found  Blackwater may have enjoyed an unfair competitive advantage over other contractors if its classification were incorrect  and as a result  may owe the American taxpayer millions of dollars in Social Security  Medicare  and unemployment taxes   Misclassification of workers as independent contractors is a widespread problem in our country  but it is particularly disturbing that a government contractor of Blackwater s scope may be engaged in it   According to the Internal Revenue Service  IRS   the misclassification of workers accounts for 30 40 percent of the  20 billion annual federal employment tax gap and can also lead to the loss of basic worker protections under labor law   As you may know  we introduced S  2044  the Independent Contractor Proper Classification Act  ICPC   earlier this year to improve enforcement of existing laws protecting workers from misclassification and laws ensuring that employers comply with their employment tax obligations   The legislation also modifies the Section 530 safe harbor in tax law that currently encourages misclassification and protects some employers engaged in it  The Section 530 safe harbor in tax law requires the IRS to excuse misclassification for employment tax purposes and allow an employer to continue reporting employees as independent contractors if the employer  1  has been treating similarly situated workers as independent contractors   2  has been consistently reporting the workers as independent contractors to the IRS and has been issuing 1099 s to the workers  or  3  has a reasonable basis to classify employees as subcontractors   The reasonable basis test is satisfied if the employer meets any one of the following   a  the employer reasonably relied on a court decision or IRS ruling issued to the employer   b  it was the subject of an IRS employment classification audit that did not result in any  assessment        for misclassification  or  c  it relied on a long standing practice of a significant segment of the industry  We are concerned that Blackwater may be violating the law by inappropriately classifying its workers as independent contractors   It is difficult to fathom how Blackwater employees in Iraq can be considered independent contractors   They are trained by Blackwater  paid by Blackwater  and told whom to guard by Blackwater   These are not independent small businessmen establishing their own individual working relationships with those they are hired to protect In a statement to the Associated Press  a Blackwater spokeswoman said the company has appealed an IRS ruling related to a specific Blackwater associate where the IRS determined that the worker had been misclassified    The spokeswoman further stated that the Small Business Administration  SBA  told the company that Blackwater security guards do not have to be classified as company employees   We do not believe it is appropriate for Blackwater  or any private company  to rely on the SBA for tax classification determinations either under Section 530 or any other provision of law and ask you for clarification   The Blackwater case is a perfect example of the failure of tax enforcement and the need for reform of the Section 530 provision   That provision currently bars the IRS from writing rules  regulations  or guidance on complying with the law   Without the ability to provide direction to employers and its own auditors  the IRS is left with piecemeal enforcement that  at best  creates confusion among businesses  and at worst  allows companies like Blackwater to purposefully evade the law    Our legislation is pending before Congress  and we look forward to working with you on it   In the interim  we ask that you open a full investigation into Blackwater s classification practices  Sincerely

  Remarks of Senator Barack Obama on the Confirmation of Judge John Roberts   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Remarks of Senator Barack Obama on the Confirmation of Judge John Roberts Thursday  September 22  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  September 22  2005 Remarks of Senator Barack Obama on the Confirmation of Judge John Roberts   First of all  let me congratulate Senator Specter and Senator Leahy for moving the process of confirming the nomination of Judge Roberts along with such civility  a civility that I believe speaks well of the Senate   Let me also say that I remain distressed that the White House during this confirmation process  which overall went smoothly  failed to provide critical documents as part of the record that could have provided us with a better basis to make our judgment with respect to the nomination   This White House continues to stymie efforts on the part of the Senate to do its job   I hope with the next nominee who comes up for the Supreme Court that the White House recognizes that in fact it is its duty not just to the Senate but to the American people to make sure we can thoroughly and adequately evaluate the record of every single nominee who comes before us   Having said that  the decision with respect to Judge Roberts  nomination has not been an easy one for me to make   As some of you know  I have not only argued cases before appellate courts but for 10 years was a member of the University of Chicago Law School faculty and taught courses in constitutional law   Part of the culture of the University of Chicago Law School faculty is to maintain a sense of collegiality between those people who hold different views   What engenders respect is not the particular outcome that a legal scholar arrives at but  rather  the intellectual rigor and honesty with which he or she arrives at a decision    Given that background  I am sorely tempted to vote for Judge Roberts based on my study of his resume  his conduct during the hearings  and a conversation I had with him yesterday afternoon  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind Judge Roberts is qualified to sit on the highest court in the land   Moreover  he seems to have the comportment and the temperament that makes for a good judge   He is humble  he is personally decent  and he appears to be respectful of different points of view   It is absolutely clear to me that Judge Roberts truly loves the law   He couldn t have achieved his excellent record as an advocate before the Supreme Court without that passion for the law  and it became apparent to me in our conversation that he does  in fact  deeply respect the basic precepts that go into deciding 95 percent of the cases that come before the Federal court    adherence to precedence  a certain modesty in reading statutes and constitutional text  a respect for procedural regularity  and an impartiality in presiding over the adversarial system   All of these characteristics make me want to vote for Judge Roberts    The problem I face    a problem that has been voiced by some of my other colleagues  both those who are voting for Mr  Roberts and those who are voting against Mr  Roberts    is that while adherence to legal precedent and rules of statutory or constitutional construction will dispose of 95 percent of the cases that come before a court  so that both a Scalia and a Ginsburg will arrive at the same place most of the time on those 95 percent of the cases    what matters on the Supreme Court is those 5 percent of cases that are truly difficult   In those cases  adherence to precedent and rules of construction and interpretation will only get you through the 25th mile of the marathon   That last mile can only be determined on the basis of one s deepest values  one s core concerns  one s broader perspectives on how the world works  and the depth and breadth of one s empathy   In those 5 percent of hard cases  the constitutional text will not be directly on point   The language of the statute will not be perfectly clear   Legal process alone will not lead you to a rule of decision   In those circumstances  your decisions about whether affirmative action is an appropriate response to the history of discrimination in this country or whether a general right of privacy encompasses a more specific right of women to control their reproductive decisions or whether the commerce clause empowers Congress to speak on those issues of broad national concern that may be only tangentially related to what is easily defined as interstate commerce  whether a person who is disabled has the right to be accommodated so they can work alongside those who are nondisabled    in those difficult cases  the critical ingredient is supplied by what is in the judge s heart   I talked to Judge Roberts about this   Judge Roberts confessed that  unlike maybe professional politicians  it is not easy for him to talk about his values and his deeper feelings   That is not how he is trained   He did say he doesn t like bullies and has always viewed the law as a way of evening out the playing field between the strong and the weak    I was impressed with that statement because I view the law in much the same way   The problem I had is that when I examined Judge Roberts  record and history of public service  it is my personal estimation that he has far more often used his formidable skills on behalf of the strong in opposition to the weak   In his work in the White House and the Solicitor General s Office  he seemed to have consistently sided with those who were dismissive of efforts to eradicate the remnants of racial discrimination in our political process  In these same positions  he seemed dismissive of the concerns that it is harder to make it in this world and in this economy when you are a woman rather than a man    I want to take Judge Roberts at his word that he doesn t like bullies and he sees the law and the Court as a means of evening the playing field between the strong and the weak   But given the gravity of the position to which he will undoubtedly ascend and the gravity of the decisions in which he will undoubtedly participate during his tenure on the Court  I ultimately have to give more weight to his deeds and the overarching political philosophy that he appears to have shared with those in power than to the assuring words that he provided me in our meeting    The bottom line is this   I will be voting against John Roberts  nomination   I do so with considerable reticence   I hope that I am wrong   I hope that this reticence on my part proves unjustified and that Judge Roberts will show himself to not only be an outstanding legal thinker but also someone who upholds the Court s historic role as a check on the majoritarian impulses of the executive branch and the legislative branch   I hope that he will recognize who the weak are and who the strong are in our society   I hope that his jurisprudence is one that stands up to the bullies of all ideological stripes  Let me conclude with just one more comment about this confirmation process     I was deeply disturbed by some statements that were made by largely Democratic advocacy groups when ranking member Senator Leahy announced that he would support Judge Roberts   Although the scales have tipped in a different direction for me  I am deeply admiring of the work and the thought that Senator Leahy has put into making his decision   The knee jerk unbending and what I consider to be unfair attacks on Senator Leahy s motives were unjustified   Unfortunately  both parties have fallen victim to this kind of pressure   I believe every Senator on the other side of the aisle  if they were honest  would acknowledge that the same unyielding  unbending  dogmatic approach to judicial confirmation has in large part been responsible for the kind of poisonous atmosphere that exists in this Chamber regarding judicial nominations   It is tempting  then  for us on this side of the aisle to go tit for tat    But what I would like to see is for all of us to recognize as we move forward to the next nominee that in fact the issues that are confronted by the Supreme Court are difficult issues   That is why they get up to the Supreme Court   The issues facing the Court are rarely black and white  and all advocacy groups who have a legitimate and profound interest in the decisions that are made by the Court should try to make certain that their advocacy reflects that complexity   These groups on the right and left should not resort to the sort of broad brush dogmatic attacks that have hampered the process in the past and constrained each and every Senator in this Chamber from making sure that they are voting on the basis of their conscience    Thank you very much                                      ,Obama

  Harkin  Hagel  Obama Take Action to Prevent Suicide Among Active Duty Soldiers   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Harkin  Hagel  Obama Take Action to Prevent Suicide Among Active Duty Soldiers Thursday  January 31  2008  For Immediate Release  Contact  Jennifer Mullin  Harkin    Jordan Stark  Hagel   or Michael Ortiz  Obama  Washington Post reports today on record number of soldier suicides last year   highest rate since 1990 Washington  D C    As news reports reveal growing numbers of suicide among soldiers serving in Afghanistan and Iraq  U S  Senators Tom Harkin  D IA   Chuck Hagel  R NE   and Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced major legislation aimed at preventing suicide among active duty members of the military  The Senators  bill  the Armed Forces Suicide Prevention Act  would direct the Department of Defense  DoD  to create a comprehensive suicide prevention program including annual training for soldiers  improved instruction for field medics and post deployment assistance  The legislation authorizes six million dollars for implementation of the programs  A companion measure will be introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Leonard Boswell  D IA   Today s Washington Post reported that Army statistics show that 121 soldiers committee suicide last year   a 20 percent increase from 2006  This is the highest rate of Army suicides recorded since the Army started collecting this data in 1980  The Post also reported that last year about 2 100 soldiers  injured themselves or attempted suicide  compared with about 350 in 2002    These startling statistics should serve as a wakeup call that suicide among soldiers and veterans is more than a problem  it is an epidemic   said Senator Harkin   Thankfully  our push to provide America s veterans with a suicide prevention program was heard last year  when the President signed the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act into law  But there is more work ahead   especially in serving our active duty military personnel  We can and must act quickly to save our soldiers who are so bravely fighting for our country     Since the beginning of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan there has been a significant increase in suicides among active duty soldiers   This is a reality our country must face as we are engaged in two conflicts   This legislation will enhance and strengthen the Defense Department s suicide prevention programs for all active duty military personnel   It is critical for our service members to be provided with the necessary mental health services they deserve   There can be no higher priority for America than our soldiers and their families   said Senator Hagel   Our nation s heroes deserve our greatest support and commitment  and we must immediately address the tragic increase in suicide rates among our active duty service members   said Senator Obama   The men and women who serve our country should expect nothing less than world class medical care  treatment  rehabilitation  and counseling services   Suicide can be prevented  and we must do everything we can to help those who are suffering   This bill will help ensure there are comprehensive suicide prevention programs throughout the military  and I commend Senator Harkin s leadership on this needed legislation   Specifically  the Armed Forces Suicide Prevention Act will   Conduct a service wide mental health campaign to reduce the stigma associated with mental health issues  encourage people to seek help when needed  and increase awareness that mental health is essential to overall health and that treatments can promote recovery from mental illness   The campaign should raise awareness about assistance for substance abuse issues  as well as relationship and financial difficulties   An outreach campaign should also focus health professionals both on and off military installations to raise awareness of the health needs of returning military personnel    Implement annual suicide prevention training of all active duty  Reserve  and National Guard members and involve military leadership in outreach efforts by incorporating suicide prevention training in officer and senior enlisted training courses    Strengthen basic lifesaver training and training for military medics and medical personnel to incorporate recognition of risk factors for suicide  identification of signs and symptoms of mental health issues  and protocols for responding to crisis situations involving members of the Armed Forces who may be at high risk for suicide     Utilize crisis response teams within units to prevent and respond to traumatic events   Such teams will consist of key personnel such as medical staff  chaplains  family support staff  and peers      Provide post deployment follow up and assistance for family members and peers of members of the Armed Services on mental health problems  substance use  and financial and relationship difficulties  including information on resources to address these issues       Provides resources to the Department of Defense to examine innovative and effective strategies to recruit qualified uniformed mental health professionals    Provides resources to the Department of Defense to examine innovative and effective ways to fight the stigma associated with seeking mental health treatment    Late last year  Harkin s push for the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  to provide a comprehensive suicide prevention program for returning soldiers became a reality through the enactment of the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Action   named after Joshua Omvig  a soldier from Grundy Center who took his own life after returning from Iraq  Harkin s legislation directs the VA to integrate mental health services into veterans  primary care  and step up counseling and other mental health services for returning war veterans                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election      ,Obama

  Investigation of FEMA Toxic Trailers Included in Homeland Security Bill   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Investigation of FEMA Toxic Trailers Included in Homeland Security Bill Friday  July 27  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Adrianne Marsh  McCaskill   Ben LaBolt  Obama   Michael Teague  Pryor   Stephanie Allen  Landrieu   Vince Morris  Kerry   or Julianne Fisher  Johnson   WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators McCaskill  D MO   Obama  D IL   Pryor  D AK   Landrieu  D LA   Lieberman  D CT   Kerry  D MA   and Johnson  D SD  yesterday secured Senate passage of a measure in the 2008 Homeland Security spending bill that would require comprehensive testing of Hurricane Katrina trailers that may contain toxic levels of formaldehyde  and a full investigation on why federal authorities refused to test occupied trailers for the gas after multiple complaints and incidents were reported from hurricane victims   The amendment that was included in the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  Appropriations bill that the Senate approved last night  was in response to revelations that the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  decided against testing occupied trailers for high levels of formaldehyde in FEMA provided trailers  despite complaints since March 2006 from hurricane victims living in them   According to FEMA  many trailer residents complained of frequent coughing  bloody noses  respiratory disorders and  in at least one case  reported a possible death from potential overexposure to the invisible gas  and reports indicate that FEMA continued to deny there was a problem for over a year  A recent House oversight hearing revealed that the agency   s Office of General Counsel recommended that FEMA not test for formaldehyde  and ordered that all decisions about testing trailers and getting information out to disaster victims about possible formaldehyde problems be run through their office first  giving the appearance that FEMA was putting potential legal liability ahead of public safety concerns  While FEMA officials have acknowledged they made mistakes and will take    swift action     the fact that the first reports to FEMA of toxic fumes occurred in March 2006 and they   re only acting now indicate that Congress should make sure this situation is immediately and adequately addressed  As a result  the Amendment would  Direct DHS Inspector General to investigate the decisions made regarding the trailer formaldehyde problem  The IG will report their findings and their recommendations to Congress  FEMA must  with input from the Centers for Disease for Control and the Environmental Protection Agency  design a program to scientifically test a representative sample of the trailers and mobile homes for formaldehyde  and then have both short and long term testing performed   This is in contrast with the reported    sniff    tests that some FEMA workers conducted that only involved inhaling to see if they could smell the gas   FEMA must report the results of the tests to Congress and  if it determines there are health risks  tell Congress their plan for relocating or assisting the impacted residents and their plan for selling or transferring surplus trailers    Within 15 days of enactment  FEMA must report to Congress on what action it has taken regarding their response to concerns over formaldehyde exposure   This report will include any disciplinary action the agency has taken on those involved in the decisions made on testing   Within 30 days of enactment  FEMA must ensure that the training practices for customer service employees  legal counsel  and other employees are updated as appropriate in relation to addressing the health concerns of recipients of FEMA assistance      We can take two attitudes in government  We can take the attitude that we want to try to look good or we can take the attitude that we re here to serve the public     Senator McCaskill said     This not only sets an important precedent for accountability  but frankly  this Congress has a solemn obligation to make sure we get to the bottom of this  Our job here is to protect the people we serve and not to protect government officials      The Bush Administration s response to Katrina was not only a logistical failure  it was a moral failure     said Senator Obama      Instead of deploying the resources necessary to save lives and rebuild communities  we find another report that the Bush Administration cut corners and buried the truth   This amendment will initiate an investigation into why the Administration failed to respond to reports of a toxic gas contaminating FEMA provided trailers and whether this environmental hazard continues to pose a threat to the victims of Katrina      It shouldn t take an act of Congress for FEMA to act in the best interest of those it should be serving  but it has   Senator Pryor said   I am pleased to join Senators McCaskill and Obama in moving this matter to the forefront and standing up for the health and welfare of hurricane victims      We must make sure that disaster victims are safe from deadly carcinogens when they rely on the federal government for temporary housing     Sen  Landrieu said      It is gravely troubling that FEMA would distribute trailers that they knew to have unacceptable levels of formaldehyde   This amendment will require a necessary report to determine the health risks in FEMA trailers so that victims     some of whom have lost their homes and all of their possessions     are not housed in a trailer that is dangerous to their health      Americans ought to be able to trust that their government won t knowingly expose them to risk     Senator Kerry said      This amendment will get us the answers we need to determine whether FEMA exposed evacuees to dangerous toxins   Senator Johnson said     In March of 2006  I pushed to have these mobile homes put to good use in Indian Country   More than a year after the process started and almost two years after Hurricane Katrina  we find out that the manufacturers built mobile homes and travel trailers that may be toxic   FEMA clearly has a problem with emergency housing they have not addressed   This directive will force the agency to take care of the problems before these mobile homes and travel trailers are sent to Indian Country or future natural disaster victims                                      ,Obama

March 31  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement on the visit of Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to the United States   I would like to extend my sincere welcome to the Honorable Kevin Rudd  who is making his first trip to the United States as the newly elected Prime Minister of Australia  This is a historic visit during a time of transition for both our nations    Earlier today  I spoke with Prime Minister Rudd  and congratulated him on his election as the first Labor Party prime minister in eleven years  I assured him of my personal commitment to maintaining a strong bilateral relationship between our nations in the years to come  and discussed our common interest in advancing peace and prosperity for the people of the United States  Australia  and the world    The alliance between the United States and Australia is deep and strong  and has stood the test of changing times  Labor Party leader John Curtain  along with President Franklin D  Roosevelt  established the U S  Australia alliance in 1942  Prime Minister Rudd s trip affirms the strategic value of this relationship and the friendship between our people  which has endured across generations and administrations    The U S  Australia alliance is a cornerstone of security and prosperity both in the Asia Pacific region and globally  Our two nations are bound by shared interests  shared values  and a common heritage    bonds that were forged in all major wars the United States was involved in during the 20th Century  a distinction unique to Australia    And  as a new century dawns  we are beginning to write a new and important chapter in the bilateral relationship   Indeed  during his first press conference the day after his election Prime Minister Rudd reiterated his strong commitment to the U S  Australia alliance  a deep commitment to a partnership of equals that I share   Like the United States  Australia is trans Pacific in orientation  and for this reason our perspectives and perceptions about regional and global affairs are often tightly aligned   The United States benefits from an Australia that can act as a regional leader in East Asia  but one with global interests and capabilities as well    The Prime Minister s visit provides an opportunity for the people of America to express our deep appreciation for Australia s contributions in combating al Qaeda   We will never forget that following the attacks on September 11  2001  Australia invoked the ANZUS treaty in support of the United States     Australia has deployed some 1000 troops in Afghanistan to the International Security Assistance Force  as well as about 1500 combat and support troops in Iraq   Prime Minister Rudd has also demonstrated real leadership in tackling the critical global challenge of climate change  Within a few weeks of assuming office  the Prime Minister successfully pushed for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol as one of the first official acts of his administration  He personally led Australia s delegation to Bali  Indonesia to participate in international negotiations on a post Kyoto protocol       In Asia  the quality of our alliance and scope of our diplomatic partnership shine brightly  We both face a rapidly evolving security order defined by traditional and non traditional security problems  These include  changing regional power dynamics and rivalries  territorial disputes  resource competition  terrorism  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  failed states  environmental degradation  and pandemic diseases  Managing this complex blend of security challenges requires leveraging both bilateral and multilateral mechanisms    The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  APEC  organization  which Australia took the lead in creating in 1989  has advanced economic liberalization and integration throughout the Asia Pacific  Australia s involvement in the East Asia Summit since its inception is a welcome development  The Trilateral Security Dialogue among the United States  Australia and Japan has become an important channel for coordinating policy and combining capabilities in addressing emerging security challenges in the Asia Pacific     As the security order in Asia evolves  Australian participation  leadership  and defense of our common values and interests are critical to building open  inclusive  transparent  and flexible regional structures and arrangements  The new arrangements cannot replace America s bilateral alliances   alliances which are not directed at any one nation  but which have served as the foundation for peace and stability in Asia for nearly half a century   But these new mechanisms  building on our traditional alliances  can help sustain the conditions for Asia s peace and prosperity to continue    Prime Minister Rudd brings special skills and experiences to this new chapter in U S  Australia relations  His progressive domestic policy agenda  innovative and realistic diplomacy  and optimistic vision enrich the already solid base of our bilateral dialogue  reminding us that we can accomplish more when we listen to our friends and allies then when we lecture them     Prime Minister Rudd s visit is an opportunity to rededicate ourselves to the U S  Australia alliance and to our broader bilateral relationship  America s foreign policy  national security and economic interests gain greatly from the deep ties with our friends

funding WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  joined a bipartisan coalition of senators in calling on the Senate Appropriations Committee to fully fund the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grant  Byrne JAG  Program in this year s Supplemental Appropriations bill   For more than two decades  the Byrne JAG program has provided funding each year for nearly 4 000 state and local law enforcement officials to help make communities safer and improve criminal justice programs    Last year  the Senate approved  660 million in the Fiscal Year 2008 Budget for this program   However  facing a veto threat from the President  this critical funding was reduced to  170 million in the Omnibus Appropriations package     Keeping our communities safe and ensuring that our justice system is fair and effective are top priorities for me in Illinois and throughout the country   said Senator Obama    Since I first met with local law enforcement officials in Alton in 2005 to discuss the growing threats posed to our neighborhoods by meth production and addiction  I have consistently demanded that the President increase funding for the Byrne program   Nearly three years after I joined to introduce legislation to restore this funding  the President has once again slashed these funds   This is unacceptable  and I will work with my colleagues to restore this funding as soon as possible    Since 2005  Senator Obama has urged his Senate colleagues and the President to increase funding for this program  In August of that year  Obama met with nearly a dozen local law enforcement officials and prosecutors at the Alton Law Enforcement Center in Madison County to hear first hand accounts of their experience with problems caused by meth use and production   These officers and prosecutors primarily expressed their concerns about the negative impact these funding cuts would have on drug investigations  particularly relating to meth  throughout the state   After hearing these concerns  Obama returned to Washington and joined several of his colleagues to introduce legislation to save the Byrne JAG program    The text of the letter is below  Dear Chairman Byrd and Senator Cochran  Restoration of severe cuts made to the Edward Byrne Justice Grant  Byrne JAG  program through last year s omnibus appropriations bill is vital to avoid law enforcement layoffs and suspension of hundreds of anti drug  gang and violent offender efforts across the country   Therefore  we respectfully request that you provide  489 6 million for the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grant  Byrne JAG  program in any Supplemental Appropriations bill that comes before the Senate   This addition would restore Byrne JAG funding to the same level previously approved by the Senate in the Commerce Justice Science  CJS  Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008  FY 2008   The Byrne Formula Grant Program is a tried and tested program that has served us well for more than two decades   The program s broad based support was verified in the Senate s passage last year of S 231  the Feinstein Chambliss Byrne JAG Reauthorization Act  which would extend this  1 095 bill authorization through 2012   The bill received 52 co sponsors and passed the Senate by unanimous consent   As you know  the Senate approved CJS Appropriations bill for FY2008 would have funded Byrne JAG at  660 million   Following a veto threat  however  difficult choices had to be made in conference  and in the Omnibus Appropriations bill that ultimately passed  Byrne JAG funding for FY2008 was reduced to only  170 4 million   This figure represented more than a 2 3 drop from Byrne JAG s actual appropriated levels in FY2007  In the wake of these drastic cuts  various law enforcement agencies  as well as numerous police and sheriff s offices  have notified us that these FY2008 Byrne JAG cuts will have a devastating effect on law enforcement  forcing them to possibly close multi jurisdictional drug and gang task forces  and negatively affecting a variety of other crime control programs   Particularly at a time when a risk of adverse economic conditions may lead to increased crime  it is vitally important that we support our nation s finest in their efforts on the front lines  where they risk their lives daily keeping Americans safe  Unless these Byrne JAG funds are restored promptly  law enforcement agencies may be forced to dismantle multi jurisdiction task forces that often took years to create and develop   And individual officers serving on those task force members will face a loss of income or even their jobs  some of which have been held for years  Each year  Byrne JAG dollars fund over 4 000 police officers and prosecutors working on over 750 drug enforcement task forces in all 50 states across hundreds of urban and rural countries and cities   On an annual basis  Byrne JAG funding leads to over 220 000 arrests  54 000 weapons seized  the seizure of 5 5 million grams of methamphetamine  and the breakup of almost 9 000 methamphetamine labs   These successes show that we need to continue what we are doing  not cut back  Funding for Byrne JAG  at its  1 095 billion authorized level  has long been supported by America s leading law enforcement organizations  including the National Narcotic Officers  Associations  Coalition  National Sheriffs  Association  National Association of Counties  National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors  Legal Action Center  National District Attorneys  Association  National HIDTA Directors Association  International Association of Chiefs of Police  Major County Sheriffs Association  National Criminal Justice Association  National Alliance of State Drug Enforcement Agencies  Major City Chiefs Association  National Troopers Coalition  State Association of Addiction Services  the National Crime Prevention Council and the Fraternal Order of Police  There is strong bipartisan support for the Byrne JAG Program  and we urge you to provide this critically needed funding in any supplemental appropriations bill that comes before the Senate this year                                Pursuant to

Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Coburn  R OK  today introduced the Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008  S 3077   which would expand the information available on USASpending gov  as well as make the data more accessible and readable  USASpending gov  aka  Google for Government    created by the Coburn Obama Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 and launched in December 2007  makes public information about nearly all Federal grants  contracts  loans and other financial assistance available in a regularly updated  user

important step last year by launching USASpending gov and giving ordinary citizens an important tool to hold Washington accountable   While USASpending gov has had tremendous success  this new legislation will expand the public information available on the website and improve the quality of government financial data   I thank Senator Coburn and the many government watchdog groups who have worked with me on this issue  and I hope Congress will quickly pass this important legislation    In our system of government the best ethics reform has always been frequent elections and the ability of citizens to hold their elected officials accountable   This legislation will give the American people valuable new tools in that effort   I m proud to have worked with Senators McCain  Obama and Carper on this important legislation   Dr  Coburn said   I m pleased to have the opportunity to work once again with my Senate colleagues to improve the transparency of federal spending   This bill is a continuation of our efforts to give taxpayers the power to know exactly what their money is being spent on and to help us in our efforts to root out waste and fraud   This legislation makes it much easier to hold agencies  contractors and others who receive federal funding accountable for their activities and their performance   said Senator Carper  In April 2006  Obama and Coburn introduced the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act  S  2590   which would publicly disclose all recipients of federal funding and financial assistance through a website to be established and maintained by the Office of Management and Budget   The President signed this legislation into law in September 2006 and USASpending gov was launched in December 2007    Today  USASpending gov tracks approximately  1 trillion in Federal grants  contracts  earmarks and loans  provides real time updates of data concerning Federal spending  gives users an opportunity to post comments and provide feedback  and displays spending data according to contractor  grantee  and congressional district  This Act would expand information on USASpending gov to include    A copy of each Federal contract in both PDF and searchable text format   Details about competitive bidding  the range of technically acceptable bids or proposals  and the profit incentives offered for each contract   The complete amount of money awarded  including any options to expand or extend under a contract  An indication if the Federal award is the result of an earmark  Information about government lease agreements and assignments in the same manner that information is reported for contracts  grants  and other assistance   An assessment of the quality of work performed on Federal awards  Information about Federal audit disputes and resolutions  terminations of Federal awards  suspensions and debarments  and administrative agreements involving Federal award recipients  Information about any civil  criminal  or administrative actions taken against Federal award recipients  including for violations related to the workplace  environmental protection  fraud  securities  and consumer protections  Information about Federal tax compliance by Federal award recipients  Information about parent company ownership that will be made accessible  along with other data on USASpending GOV  through application programming interfaces  Links to publicly available Government reports    The Act would improve data quality on USASpending gov through    Improved searchability of data and use of unique award identifiers that prevent the release of sensitive personally identifiable information  A simple method for the public to report errors and track the performance of agencies in confirming or correcting the records for which error reports have been filed    Agency inspectors general review statistically representative samples of agency awards to verify accuracy and compliance with improved data standards    General quality audit of website data every six months  including review and report of public error reporting system and recommendations for new quality standards and procedures      The

  Obama Statement on NATO Summit in Romania   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                  Washington D C  Office SDB 40B Dirksen Senate Office Building   temporary location until April 19th                                                         Obama Statement on NATO Summit in Romania Monday  March  3  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE      CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement on the NATO Summit in Bucharest  Romania next month   From April 2 to 4  2008  leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO  will meet at a summit in Bucharest  Romania  to address issues critical to American national security and the future of the Euro Atlantic community  NATO leaders must seize this opportunity to strengthen transatlantic ties  augment alliance members  contributions to common missions and continue to build the integrated  stable and prosperous Europe that is a vital interest of the United States   A top priority for the summit must be to reinforce NATO s critical mission in Afghanistan  The contributions there of all the NATO allies alongside more than a dozen other countries bears testimony to how the alliance can contribute to the 21st century missions that are vital to the security of the United States and its allies  NATO s involvement provides capabilities  legitimacy  and coordination in Afghanistan that simply would not be available if NATO did not exist   Success in Afghanistan is vital to the security of the United States  to all NATO members  and to the people of Afghanistan  NATO s leaders must therefore send an unambiguous message that every country in NATO will do whatever needs to be done to destroy terrorist networks in Afghanistan  to prevent the Taliban from returning to power  and to bring greater security and well being to the Afghan people  This will require adequate numbers of capable military forces and civilian personnel from NATO members and putting more of an Afghan face on counter insurgency operations by providing more training and resources to the Afghan National Army and police forces  and by embedding more Afghan forces in NATO missions  We must also win long term public support through assistance programs that make a difference in the lives of the Afghan people  including investments in infrastructure and education  the development of alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers to undermine the Taliban and other drug traffickers  and increased efforts to combat corruption through safeguards on assistance and support for the rule of law   Success in Afghanistan will also require the removal of restrictions that some allies have placed on their forces in Afghanistan  which hamper the flexibility of commanders on the ground  The mission in Afghanistan  legitimized by a United Nations mandate  supported by the Afghan people  and endorsed by all NATO members after the United States was attacked is central to NATO s future as a collective security organization  Afghanistan presents a test of whether NATO can carry out the crucial missions of the 21st century  and NATO must come together to meet that challenge  Now is the time for all NATO allies to recommit to this common purpose   The summit must also address the question of the alliance expanding membership  NATO enlargement since the end of the Cold War has helped the countries of Central and Eastern Europe become more stable and democratic  It has also added to NATO military capability by facilitating contributions from new members to critical missions such as Afghanistan   The three current candidates for NATO membership  Albania  Croatia and the Republic of Macedonia  have each made great strides in consolidating their new democracies  They have reformed their defense establishments  worked to root out corruption  modernized their economies  and contributed to NATO security missions in the Balkans and Afghanistan  Responding to these efforts with NATO membership at the upcoming summit would add to the alliance military capabilities while contributing to stability in the Balkans  a region still suffering from the ethnic tensions left behind by the bloodshed of the 1990s   Ukraine and Georgia have also been developing their ties with NATO  Their leaders have declared their readiness to advance a NATO Membership Action Plan  MAP  to prepare for the rights and obligations of membership  They are working to consolidate democratic reforms and to undertake new responsibilities in their relationship with the Alliance  I welcome the desire and actions of these countries to seek closer ties with NATO and hope that NATO responds favorably to their request  consistent with its criteria for membership  Whether Ukraine and Georgia ultimately join NATO will be a decision for the members of the alliance and the citizens of those countries  after a period of open and democratic debate  But they should receive our help and encouragement as they continue to develop ties to Atlantic and European institutions   NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia  Russia has an important role to play in European and global affairs and should see NATO as a partner  not as a threat  But we should oppose any efforts by the Russian government to intimidate its neighbors or control their foreign policies  Russia cannot have a veto over which countries join the alliance  Since the end of the Cold War  Republican and Democratic administrations have supported the independence and sovereignty of all the states of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union  and we must continue to do so  President Putin recent threat to point missiles at Ukraine is simply not the way to promote the peaceful 21st century Europe we seek   NATO stands as an example of how the United States can advance American national security  and the security of the world  through a strong alliance rooted in shared responsibility and shared values  NATO remains a vital asset in America s efforts to anchor democracy and stability in Europe and to defend our interests and values all over the world  The Bucharest summit provides an opportunity to advance these goals and to reinforce a vital alliance  NATO s leaders must seize that opportunity

              Obama  Durbin  Hare Introduce Bill to Improve Student Behavior in Schools Tuesday  October  2  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Amy Brundage  Obama   Christina Mulka  Durbin   or Tim Schlittner  Hare  WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Dick Durbin  D IL   and Representative Phil Hare  D IL  today introduced the Positive Behavior for Effective Schools Act  H R  3407  S  2111   which directs resources to innovative programs designed to teach positive behavior as a way to improve school climate and make it easier for students to learn   Positive Behavior Support  PBS  programs define and support appropriate behaviors by explicitly teaching students about good behavior and including it as part of the curriculum    PBS programs have resulted in improved school climate and more time spent on learning   For example  at Lincoln Elementary School in Chicago Heights  the number of students sent to an administrator   s office for fighting dropped by half over the course of a year   At Springfield High School in Springfield  out of school suspensions decreased by 38   allowing students to learn more by reclaiming 180 school days that would otherwise have been lost to suspensions  At Mark Twain Primary School in Kankakee  disciplinary referrals decreased dramatically  from 268 before PBS compared to 38 last year  at the same time  ISAT reading and math scores are at an all time high       America   s teachers deserve our long term commitment so that they can provide students with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed     said Senator Obama      Positive Behavior Support programs have proven successful in Illinois and throughout the country   They teach good behavior and reduce the need for discipline in the classroom  in turn allowing more time for teachers to teach   We must expand these innovative programs to teach our students about positive behavior   Let s give our teachers this additional tool to support their teaching  and let   s give our children the benefit of high expectations and supports for good behavior   These programs would not only strengthen our schools  but would bolster our nation   s competitiveness by providing the best possible learning environments for our next generation of leaders        When students act out  the classroom environment is damaged making it more difficult for students to learn and teachers to teach     said Durbin      Good behavior is a skill that can be learned and should be taught   Unfortunately  in many cases  children do not receive this lesson at home  Illinois is one state that has developed a system to address this problem in the classroom   These Positive Support Behavior programs can serve as a national model to improve student behavior   The bill that Senator Obama  Congressman Hare and I are introducing today will give teachers the resources they need to improve their classroom environment and allow more time for academic instruction        The old formula of attempting to yield good behavior and academic performance by threatening students with detention or other punishment has run its course     Hare said     The PBS approach rewards students for doing the right thing while recognizing that success in school is contagious  My visit to Monmouth Roseville Junior High in February convinced me that many students in PBS programs are motivating each other to reach new heights  As a member of the Education and Labor Committee  I felt compelled to introduce the Positive Behavior for Effective Schools Act   I look forward to working with Senator Obama and the Illinois PBIS Network to ensure this bill is included in the soon to be reauthorized No Child Left Behind law     In PBS schools  the adults act together to set common expectations  not just for learning  but for the behaviors that support learning   In any given school  the problem might be a general lack of discipline  too much bullying  or a loss of instructional time due to suspensions   Schools can address any of these problems  using proven practices  supported by a collaborative network of researchers  schools  and teachers  along with universities and resource centers that work with over 6 700 schools in 38 states  More than 700 schools in Illinois already use PBS      Illinois leads the nation in implementing school wide PBIS with over 700 schools in 179 districts supported by the Illinois PBIS Network     said Lucille Eber  Ed D   State Director of the IL PBIS Network      These schools are experiencing decreases in discipline problems  increases in academic achievement  and improved measures of school safety   Additionally  schools that achieve full implementation show greater capacity for success with students who have more serious behavioral learning needs   More importantly  we have seen these results increase and sustain over the past nine years in Illinois schools     Positive Behavior for Effective Schools Act  To support PBS efforts  the Positive Behavior for Effective Schools Act amends Elementary and Secondary Education Act  ESEA  to make PBS an allowable use of funds  and proposes an Office of Specialized Instructional Support Services  More specifically  the Act  Provides flexibility for use of Title I funds  State agencies may use these funds to provide technical assistance and support to

Increase Access to Renewable Fuels Stalled by IRS   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today asked Energy Secretary Samuel W  Bodman to affirm the Bush Administration s commitment to reducing our dependence on foreign oil by pressing the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  to immediately allow service stations to take advantage of a law that would greatly increase consumer access to renewable fuels like E85  Secretary Bodman will be in Peoria on Thursday    It has now been eight months since this bill became law  and I am frustrated that the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  has yet to make the tax credit available to station owners who want to sell alternative fuels   Obama wrote in a letter to Secretary Bodman   More frustrating still are reports that an initial IRS interpretation would only allow this tax credit to be used once a year by a taxpayer  even though I and other advocates of the provision intended the credit to be available to companies that own more than one service station and want to install alternative fuel equipment at multiple locations      Obama asked Secretary Bodman to use his leverage as Energy Secretary to pressure the IRS to correctly interpret legislation Obama strongly supported that would provide a tax credit of up to  30 000 for the installation of equipment that would allow fueling stations to offer alternative fuels  The legislation was signed into law last year but the IRS has yet to make the credit available to station owners    Obama said he is particularly concerned by initial IRS interpretations of the tax credit that would only allow it to be used once per year per individual  When Obama and other advocates wrote and supported this tax credit legislation last year  they clearly intended the credit to be used by companies owning more than one service station to install alternative fuel equipment at multiple locations    Obama asked Secretary Bodman to pledge to advocates of the tax credit and to farmers across Illinois who are already doing their part to lessen our dependence on foreign oil to support this legislation  It is estimated that the tax credit would triple the number of stations offering E85 in the first year after its implementation    It s time for the federal government to do its part to ensure that consumers who purchase flexible fuel vehicles have access to alternative fuels   Obama wrote   One way to accomplish this goal is for you to clearly state your support for an interpretation of the alternative fuels tax credit that encourages gas station chains to offer alternative fuels at all of their locations across the country     It is estimated that there are more than 4 million flexible fuel vehicles on the road today but only several hundred stations where E85 is sold      April 5  2006   The Honorable Samuel W  Bodman  Secretary  U S  Department of Energy  1000 Independence Ave   SW  Washington  DC  20585   Dear Secretary Bodman    Last August  President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act  which included a provision I advocated that would provide a tax credit of up to  30 000 for the installation of equipment to allow fueling stations to offer alternative fuels like E 85 to their customers    It has now been eight months since this bill became law  and I am frustrated that the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  has yet to make the tax credit available to

though I and other advocates of the provision intended the credit to be used by companies owning more than one service station that want to install alternative fuel equipment at multiple locations     During your visit to Peoria tomorrow  I hope you will assure me and the thousands of farmers across the state already doing their part to lessen our dependence on foreign oil that you share our commitment to alternative fuels   The U S  auto industry is also taking significant steps in this area by committing itself to producing hundreds of thousands of new flexible fuel vehicles  FFVs  in the coming years     Now it s time for the federal government to do its part to ensure that consumers who purchase FFVs have access to alternative fuels   One way to accomplish this goal is for you to clearly state your support for an interpretation of the alternative fuels tax credit that encourages gas station chains to offer such fuels at all of their locations across the country    I hope that you will commit to me and the people of Illinois that you will use your position as Secretary of Energy to encourage the IRS to interpret this law as it was intended and increase America s access to alternative fuels   Only then can we break what the President himself called America s  addiction  to foreign oil   Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator

  Obama  Clinton Introduce Legislation to Get Dangerous Lead Out of Child Care Facilities   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  Clinton Introduce Legislation to Get Dangerous Lead Out of Child Care Facilities Tuesday  October  3  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Clinton Contact   202  224 2243  Date  October 3  2006  Obama  Clinton Introduce Legislation to Get Dangerous Lead Out of Child Care Facilities  Estimated that 14 Percent of Child care Facilities Contain Toxic Lead   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  today said that they have introduced legislation that would help protect children from lead poisoning by requiring that all non home based child care facilities  including Head Start program locations and kindergarten classrooms  be lead safe within five years  The legislation would establish a  42 6 million grant program to help local communities pay to make these facilities safe    For decades  we ve known that lead is poisonous to young children  but 30 years after we banned lead from paint  millions of children are still at risk when they re in day care or at school   said Obama   This legislation will make sure that our kids are protected from lead  and that local communities have the funding they need to make sure these facilities are safe      It is critical that we remove lead hazards where our children live  learn and play   We know that lead poisoning can devastate our children s ability to learn  grow and develop and we need to eliminate these risks and hazards that continue to persist in child care facilities and schools  New York City and Rochester have been at the forefront of grassroots efforts to combat lead poisoning  and this bill would provide important resources and incentives to implement lead prevention programs nationwide   said Senator Clinton    According to the Centers for Disease Control  about 310 000 children nationwide have toxic lead levels in their blood  with poor and minority children disproportionately at risk  The problem of lead contamination is especially great in the Midwest and Northeast where 40 percent of child care centers were built prior to 1960    Illinois has the highest lead poisoning rate in the nation  According to an Illinois Department of Public Health report  Illinois amounted to 20 5 percent of all elevated blood levels reported nationwide  The report also found that African American children are more than three times as likely to suffer from elevated lead levels and Hispanic children are more than twice as likely to suffer from elevated lead levels    Each year in New York State  an additional 10 000 children under the age of six are newly identified as having elevated blood lead levels  and over 200 000 children in New York have had documented lead poisoning between 1992 and 2004  Exposure to lead results in increased expenses each year for New York in the form of special education and other education expenses  medical care for lead poisoned children  and expenditures for delinquent youth and other needing special supervision  It is estimated that these increased expenses  as well as lost earnings  exceed  4 billion annually     The Lead Poisoning Reduction Act of 2006 requires all non home based child care facilities to be certified lead safe in five years   It establishes a five year   42 6 million grant program to help communities reduce lead exposure in day care centers  Head Start programs and kindergartens   It also establishes best practices for communities to test for and reduce lead hazards    Lead paint in older buildings is a primary source of exposure  but significant lead exposure can also come from tap water   Lead is rarely found in the source water used for public water supplies  but more commonly enters tap water as a result of corrosion of water lines  pipes  and household plumbing   Lead in drinking water can be a significant source of lead exposure  and can account for as much as 60 percent of the exposure for infants and children who consume formula and concentrated juices   Children suffer the greatest negative health impacts  since lead adversely impacts physical and mental development  decreased intelligence  behavioral problems  and can also lead to kidney damage  anemia  reproductive disorders  seizures  coma  and even death       Nearly 12 million children under age 5 spend 40 hours a week in child care  An estimated 14 percent of licensed child care centers nationwide are contaminated with hazardous levels of lead based paint  according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development   A recent report by the U S  Government Accountability Office  GAO  identified significant  systemic problems with the way in which the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  monitors and regulates the levels of lead in our nation s drinking water including a complete lack of reliable data on which to make assessments and decisions  The GAO study found that few schools and child care facilities nationwide have tested their water for lead and no focal point exists at either the national or state level to collect and analyze test results   Few states have comprehensive programs to detect and remediate lead in drinking water at schools and child care facilities     In June  in response to the GAO report  Senators Obama and Clinton joined with Senators Jim Jeffords  Joe Lieberman  Frank Lautenberg and Barbara Boxer in sending a letter to EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson calling on the agency to come clean on its methods for testing nationwide lead levels in drinking water and to immediate implement the GAO report s recommendations  including updating EPA s 1994 guidance on lead in drinking water in schools and non residential buildings

  Legislation Introduced to Ban Lead in Toys for Young Children Wednesday  October  3  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Karen Lightfoot  Waxman   Sharon Jenkins  Toure Muhammad  Rush   Rebecca Gale  Carney   Rick Jauert  Ellison   or Amy Brundage  Obama  WASHINGTON  D C      Citing recent recalls and the longtime failure of the Consumer Product Safety Commission to protect children from hazardous levels of lead in consumer products  Rep  Henry A  Waxman  together with Reps  Bobby L  Rush  Christopher P  Carney  and Keith Ellison  today introduced the Lead Free Toys Act to ban lead from toys  toy jewelry  and other products used by children under age six   Sen  Barack Obama introduced the companion bill in the Senate today      Lead in children   s products is dangerous and unnecessary     said Rep  Henry A  Waxman  Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee      For nearly three years I have called for strong action to get the lead out of these products   I hope now the time has arrived   This is the kind of simple  commonsense action that the Consumer Product Safety Commission should have taken years ago           The provisions called for in this bill are long overdue given more than 30 years of documented evidence of the damage that can be done to children  especially those in low income communities  from exposure to this neuro toxin     said Rep  Bobby Rush  Chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce  Trade  and Consumer Protection of the Committee on Energy and Commerce      Following recent hearings on this issue in our subcommittee  I believe that a full ban on lead in children   s toys and jewelry is the only way to prevent this poison from harming children and families         As a father of five  I am concerned about our children   s safety  Children   s toys on U S  store shelves should not contain unknown hazards that can cause such potentially devastating harm     said Rep  Christopher P  Carney      This legislation is a good first step to keeping hazardous substances out of our children   s toys   I look forward to working with Congressman Waxman to ensure the safety of toys across the nation   As the holidays approach  this legislation is even more urgent        I am honored to stand with Congressman Waxman in introducing this important legislation to ban lead in children   s toy products     said Rep  Keith Ellison      This is personal for me   Last year  one of my constituents  a four year old toddler named Jarnell Brown died because he swallowed a charm on a bracelet that contained dangerous amounts of lead   Were this legislation the law of the land  perhaps Jarnell would be celebrating a fifth birthday this year   This bill  when enacted  will prevent future tragedies for Jarnell Brown  his parents and countless other American families        Lead contaminated toys have endangered the lives of millions of our country   s children     said Sen  Obama      The health of our children is a top priority  and we must take every step required to protect them from these dangerous products   The extraordinary scale of this challenge demands meaningful and innovative solutions to prevent lead contaminated toys from harming our children   This legislation will help restore the confidence of the American people that the products they are using are thoroughly inspected and safe  and I thank Chairman Waxman for his leadership on this issue       High doses of lead can cause seizures and even death  while low doses can cause impaired learning and behavioral problems   Recent recalls of popular children   s toys have brought attention to the problem of lead in such products  but this issue is not new   In late 2004  nearly 150 million pieces of toy jewelry were recalled for toxic levels of lead   In 2005 and 2006 millions more pieces of tainted jewelry were recalled  and in March 2006  a young child died after ingesting a Reebok charm that contained over 99  lead  In January 2005  citing the initial wave of toy jewelry recalls  Rep  Waxman called on the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  to take decisive action to protect children   When CPSC refused to set a strong  enforceable standard  Reps  Waxman  Rush  and others introduced the Lead Free Toys Act  a bill directing CPSC to ban anything above trace levels of lead in children   s products   Now  over two years later  new recalls have exposed the presence of lead in many more children   s products  and CPSC still has failed to address this hazard   Today   s legislation imposes a statutory limit on lead in children   s products  rather than directing CPSC to impose such a ban  Under the bill as reintroduced  any product marketed for use by children under age six or whose substantial use by children under age six is foreseeable may contain no more than the following levels of lead  600 parts per million  ppm   effective within 30 days of enactment 250 ppm  effective one year after enactment 100 ppm  effective two years after enactment This step wise approach will impose immediate changes to protect children while giving manufacturers additional time to develop controls to ensure that all children   s products are free of lead  The text of the bill is available online at www oversight house gov                                    ,Obama

5511  Lawmakers Make Renewable Fuels Availability  Energy Efficiency a Top Priority for New Congress  Sens  Obama  Harkin  Lugar  Biden  Dorgan  Introduce BioFuels Security Act   WASHINGTON  D C    On the first day of the new Congress  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Tom Harkin  D IA   Richard G  Lugar  R IN   Joseph R  Biden Jr   D DE  and Byron L  Dorgan  D ND  introduced legislation that will increase American drivers  access to ethanol at fuel pumps  Currently  the United States imports more than 60 percent of its oil  and our consumption continues to increase   further subjecting consumers to the whims of the world oil market  Over sixty percent of the world s oil reserves are held in the Middle East  handcuffing our foreign policy    American drivers can help reverse our oil dependence by filling up with ethanol blends like E85  85  ethanol  15  gas  or biodiesel  Increasing the use of ethanol will reduce our oil consumption and give us an environmentally friendly  domestically produced source of fuel   Today  Sens  Harkin  Lugar  Biden  Dorgan and Obama offered legislation  titled the BioFuels Security Act  to increase renewable fuels use through higher renewable fuels standards  RFS   greater availability of ethanol pumps and increased production of cars equipped to run on alternative fuel sources   The Renewable Fuels Standard is one of the most significant steps taken by Congress to increase ethanol production and decrease our nation s dangerous dependence on foreign oil   Senator Obama said   We should build off this success by increasing ethanol production  consumer access to renewable fuels  and the production of cars and trucks that can use them  It s time for Congress to realize what farmers in America s heartland have known all along   that we have the capacity and ingenuity to decrease our dependence on foreign oil by growing our own fuel  but what we ve been lacking is the political will       For too long  we ve depended on importing oil to meet our energy needs   Senator Harkin said   This legislation lays the roadmap to a long term ramp up in domestically produced renewable fuels  I believe if we are to attain national and economic security for our nation  we can and we must achieve these aggressive goals       I am pleased to join Senator Tom Harkin in re introducing the Biofuels Security Act in the 110th Congress  Our nation must take seriously our future energy security  and I am hopeful that this Congress will consider the merits of this aggressive  yet prudent  bi partisan legislation   Senator Lugar said     If it was not clear before  it is now   domestic energy policy is at the center of our foreign policy   said Senator Biden   For our own security   both nationally and globally    we have to begin the transition to alternative fuels  We can t do that without upgrading to a better system that combines protection for U S  automobile manufacturing jobs with increased use of alternative  home grown fuels   We have no choice but to get smarter with our energy policy      We must work towards requiring more use of ethanol and significant long term investment in renewable fuels to lead to a decrease of our nation s dependence on foreign sources of oil   said Senator Dorgan   This increase in ethanol production will expand job growth in the U S      The Renewable Fuels Standard is one of the most significant steps taken by Congress to increase ethanol production and decrease our nation s dangerous dependence on foreign oil   Senator Obama said   We should build off this success by increasing ethanol production  consumer access to renewable fuels  and the production of cars and trucks that can use them  It s time for Congress to realize what farmers in America s heartland have known all along   that we have the capacity and ingenuity to decrease our dependence on foreign oil by growing our own fuel  but what we ve been lacking is the political will     Specifically  the bill  Proposes a new renewable fuels standard  RFS  that calls for 60 billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel to be included in the United States motor vehicle fuel supply annually by the year 2030 by boosting ethanol and biodiesel production to 30 billion gallons annually by 2020  and then doubling that quantity over the following ten years to 60 billion gallons by 2030   Calls for increasing the number of gasoline stations that carry blends of 85  ethanol  E85   The bill would require large oil companies to install E85 pumps at their stations  increasing by five percentage points annually over the next 10 years  resulting in approximately 50  percent of all major brand gasoline stations nationwide having E85 pumps available within a decade   Directs automakers to gradually increase flex fuel vehicle  FFV  production  increasing in ten percentage point increments annually  until nearly all vehicles sold in the U S  are FFV s within 10 years  Currently  flex fuel vehicles    those able to use both regular gasoline and blends of up to 85 percent ethanol  E85    make up only about two percent of vehicles on the road                                   ,Obama

Obama Introduces Resolution to Halt Rush to War with Iran Friday  November  2  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5566 Legislation would undo damage caused by Senate   s passage of Kyl Lieberman amendment WASHINGTON  D C      Yesterday evening  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  introduced Senate Joint Resolution 23  a legislative proposal specifying that the use of force against Iran is not authorized by any previous action of Congress   This would include the authorization of the use of force against Iraq  the recently passed Kyl Lieberman amendment  which states that our military presence in Iraq should be used to counter Iran  and any resolution previously adopted by Congress   There is absolutely no reason to trust that this Administration will not use existing congressional authorization to justify military action against Iran   said Senator Obama   The Iraq War authorization and the recently passed Kyl Lieberman amendment have opened the door to an attack on Iran  and Congress must now shut that door  We need aggressive diplomacy and economic pressure  which is why I support sanctions on Iran  Those efforts must not be linked to the use of our military presence in Iraq and the region  because we have seen what this Administration does when you trust them to do the right thing but give them an opening to do the wrong thing     Given concerns about the Bush Administration   s expansive view of executive authority  and the likelihood that any attack on Iran would come from our military presence already in Iraq and the region  this resolution is necessary to remove any suggestion that Kyl Lieberman or any other existing provision of law or resolution authorizes the President to attack Iran  Instead  the President will have to get specific statutory authorization from the Congress to use force against Iran   The text of the joint resolution is below  Clarifying that the use of force against Iran is not authorized by the Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq  any resolution previously adopted  or any other provision of law  Whereas the Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq  Public Law 107 243  authorized the President  to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to      1  defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq  and  2  enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq     Whereas  on September 26  2007  the Senate agreed to a provision  Senate Amendment 3017 to Senate Amendment 2011 to H R  1585  stating the sense of the Senate that     the manner in which the United States transitions and structures its military presence in Iraq will have critical long term consequences for the future of the Persian Gulf and the Middle East  in particular with regard to the capability of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to pose a threat to the security of the region     Whereas  on September 26  2007  the Senate also stated the sense of the Senate  that it is a critical national interest of the United States to prevent the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran from turning Shi   a militia extremists in Iraq into a Hezbollah like force that could serve its interests inside Iraq     Whereas  on October 25  2007  the Department of State designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  IRGC  and the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics  MODAFL  as proliferators of weapons of mass destruction under Executive Order 13382 in relation to concerns about their role in proliferation activities  Whereas  on October 25  2007  the Department of the Treasury also designated 9 IRGC affiliated entities and 5 IRGC affiliated individuals  as derivatives of the IRGC  as well as Iran   s state owned Bank Melli and Bank Mellat and 3 individuals affiliated with Iran   s Aerospace Industries Organization  AIO   as proliferators of weapons of mass destruction or supporters of terrorism under Executive Order 13382  Whereas  on October 25  2007  the Department of the Treasury also designated the IRGC Qods Force  IRGC QF  as a supporter of terrorism for providing material support to the Taliban and other terrorist organizations  and designated Iran   s state owned Bank Saderat as a terrorist financier  under Executive Order 13224  and Whereas any offensive military action taken by the United States against Iran must be explicitly authorized by Congress  Now therefore be it  Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled  That nothing in the Authorization for the Use of Force Against Iraq  Public Law 107 243   any act that serves as the statutory authority for Executive Order 13382 or Executive Order 13224  any resolution previously adopted  or any other provision of law including the terms of Executive Order 13382 or Executive Order 13224 shall be construed to authorize  encourage  or in any way address the use of Armed Forces of the United States against Iran

Administration   s Failure to Monitor Communications of Deadly Terrorists in U S  Custody   WASHINGTON     In a letter to President Bush  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid  D NV  and Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today said that the Administration   s failure to monitor the communications of deadly terrorists already in U S  captivity calls into question the ability of this Administration to conduct the intelligence operations required to effectively fight terrorism    In a report released yesterday  the Department of Justice Inspector General  IG  Glenn Fine concluded that    the  Federal Bureau of Prisons  BOP has not ensured that mail for terrorist and other high risk inmates on its monitoring lists is consistently read and analyzed to detect terrorism  criminal activities  or other inappropriate behavior     As a result  according to the IG report     the threat remains that terrorist and other high risk inmates can use mail and verbal communications to conduct terrorist or criminal activities while incarcerated       In their letter  the Senators said     The failure to monitor the communications of these deadly terrorists already in captivity calls into question the Bush Administration   s ability to wage an effective war on terror and competently conduct intelligence operations that are crucial to keeping our nation safe       The Federal Bureau of Prisons  BOP  is supposed to carefully screen 100  of mail sent and received by high risk inmates  including convicted terrorists  When the mail is in a foreign language  the BOP is expected to have the mail reviewed and translated by someone fluent in that language   The BOP is also supposed to monitor verbal communications of convicted terrorists over the telephone  in visiting rooms  and in the cellblock     But the report found that these communications are rarely if ever monitored  and that BOP officials are lacking the resources and training required to do their jobs    Some of the most troubling conclusion in the report include   The BOP did not hire any full time Arabic language specialists to translate inmate communications until 2005     four years after the 9 11 attacks   At one federal prison  only 0 3  of mail for all inmates was randomly screened by BOP staff   At one federal prison  the three FBI agents responsible for terrorism matters were not even aware that there were two inmates at the prison who were incarcerated for international terrorism crimes     Below please find the full text of the letter    October 4  2006   The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  Washington  DC 20500   Dear President Bush     We are writing to express our serious concerns about your Administration   s failure to monitor all mail to and from convicted terrorists in federal prisons   Your Administration   s disregard for this basic surveillance obligation leaves our nation at grave risk    As you know  the Federal Bureau of Prisons  BOP  is supposed to carefully screen 100  of mail sent and received by high risk inmates  including convicted terrorists   When the mail is in a foreign language  the BOP is expected to have the mail reviewed and translated by someone fluent in that language   The BOP is also supposed to monitor the verbal communications of convicted terrorists over the telephone  in visiting rooms  and in the cellblock     These screening requirements are intended to address the real threat posed by terrorists in our prisons   For instance  in March 2005  news reports indicated that three convicted terrorists at the federal penitentiary in Florence  Colorado  who were imprisoned for the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center had written approximately 90 letters to Islamic extremists between 2002 and 2004   Some of these letters were written to members of a Spanish terror cell with links to terrorists suspected in the March 2004  train bombings in Madrid    However  in a report released yesterday  the Department of Justice Inspector General  IG  Glenn Fine concluded that    the BOP has not ensured that mail for terrorist and other high risk inmates on its monitoring lists is consistently read and analyzed to detect terrorism  criminal activities  or other inappropriate behavior      As a result  according to the IG report     the threat remains that terrorist and other high risk inmates can use mail and verbal communications to conduct terrorist or criminal activities while incarcerated        The failure to monitor the communications of these deadly terrorists already in captivity calls into question your ability to wage an effective war on terror and competently conduct intelligence operations that are crucial to keeping our nation safe    Among the report   s findings are the following    At 7 of the 10 prisons surveyed by the IG  the amount of mail involving convicted terrorists that was monitored has decreased since FY 2005 because of BOP cost cutting initiatives   At one federal prison  only 0 3  of mail for all inmates was randomly screened by BOP staff    The BOP did not hire any full time Arabic language specialists to translate inmate communications until 2005     four years after the 9 11 attacks     The first group of Arabic language specialists hired by BOP received no counterterrorism intelligence training during their first year of employment that would help them analyze the mail they were reading    At one prison  only 3 out of 1 385  0 2   of calls involving high risk inmates  including convicted terrorists  were monitored during the month of August 2005   The prison also housed organized crime figure John Gotti  Jr   who was awaiting trial for kidnapping and racketeering  and none of his 50 phone calls during that month were monitored    The BOP did not audio record the social visits of terrorist inmates  and according to the IG report     the BOP may be missing opportunities to detect terrorist or criminal activity       There is wide variation in the amount of information shared between the BOP and FBI regarding terrorist inmates   At one federal prison  the three FBI agents responsible for terrorism matters were not even aware that there were two inmates who were incarcerated for international terrorism crimes   The prison staff at another facility learned from a news article  rather than the FBI  that an international terrorist housed at their prison was a high ranking member of al Qaeda and had trained to be a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden    We urge you to take immediate action to ensure that the Bureau of Prisons remedies this serious security failure   In the War on Terror  there is no excuse for any agency to allow terrorist activity in its midst   The Department of Justice and the Bureau of Prisons must stop convicted terrorists from engaging in terrorist communications    We ask that you respond by October 13  2006  as to the steps that you are taking to address this problem   Thank you    Sincerely    Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid  Senator Barack Obama                                    ,Obama

Cyrul  Harkin   Melanie Roussell  Conyers   Jonathan Godfrey  Conyers   or Corey Ealons  Davis    WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Tom Harkin  D IA   Joe Biden  D DE   and Representatives John Conyers  D MI   Bennie Thompson  D MS   Artur Davis  D AL   Jerrold Nadler  D NY   Bobby Scott  D VA  and Steve Chabot  R OH  yesterday to President Bush asking him to investigate allegations of the USDA lobbying against legislation that would bring compensation for black farmers who were victims of discrimination  The Pigford settlement  approved in 1999  allowed black farmers to file claims against the USDA for failing to respond to racial discrimination complaints between 1983 and 1997  Recently passed legislation in the House of Representatives would allow certain previously denied farmers an opportunity to re file their settlement claims and have them reviewed on their merits  Obama has introduced companion legislation  S  1989  in the Senate  Below is a copy of the letter  October 4  2007 President George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  DC Dear Mr  President  We write to express our serious concerns about the apparent posture of the United States Department of Agriculture     USDA     toward efforts in Congress to provide a small measure of justice to African American farmers who were victims of discrimination   We refer specifically to the alleged efforts of individual USDA employees to lobby illegally to undermine remedial civil rights legislation passed in the House of Representatives as well as the apparent USDA strategy of criticizing Congressional efforts for raising    false hopes    among farmers while doing nothing affirmative to make legitimate hopes of compensation for past abuses come true   By way of background  in 1999  the USDA settled a class action lawsuit with African American farmers in the case of Pigford v  Glickman   The U S  District Court for the District of Columbia approved of this settlement as    a good first step towards assuring that the kind of discrimination that has been visited on African American farmers since Reconstruction will not continue into the next century      Opinion in Pigford v  Glickman  Civil Action No  97 1978   The order of the Court concluded     the Department of Agriculture and the county commissioners discriminated against African American farmers when they denied  delayed  or otherwise frustrated the applications of those farmers for farm loans and other credit and benefit programs     The denial of credit and benefits has had a devastating impact on African American farmers      This settlement  known as the Pigford consent decree  brought relief to over 20 000 black farmers and was indeed a good first step towards righting an historic wrong   Unfortunately  for a variety of reasons  approximately 75 000 additional black farmers filed their claims of discrimination through the Pigford consent decree claims adjudication process after the filing deadline   As a result  thousands of victims of discrimination continue to be denied an opportunity even to have their claims heard and evaluated on the merits  H R  2419  which passed the House of Representatives on July 27  2007  provides qualifying late Pigford claimants with a right to go to court and have their cases adjudicated on the merits   Similar bipartisan legislation has been introduced in the Senate and may be included in the Senate version of the farm bill   We urge your support for this important and overdue legislation  It appears  however  that USDA is intent on undermining these efforts   There were reports in early August about USDA Farm Services Agency  FSA  employees using federal resources to lobby against the legislation passed in the House   And more recently the General Counsel has publicly criticized the legislation on the grounds that there are 30 times as many valid claims of discrimination as the  100 million funding provided in the House bill will cover   We welcome USDA   s concern that black farmers not be shut out yet again from receiving just compensation for the wrongs they have suffered   If the USDA believes  however  as its General Counsel suggests  that two thirds of the 75 000 late filers will show legitimate claims of discrimination by the USDA  the right thing for the USDA to do is to work as a good faith partner in crafting a fair and responsible remedy  The USDA should sit down with class counsel  the judge and any other appropriate parties to discuss options for modifying the consent decree or finding other ways to accommodate additional late filers    We firmly believe that farmers who believe they have been the victims of discrimination should be allowed to have their cases heard and adjudicated on the merits  Those most familiar with the farmers    claims believe that the cost estimates significantly overstate potential Federal exposure from permitting this limited class of mostly poor farmers to bring cases in court   Whether one believes that a funding limitation is advisable or not  however  we cannot sit by aware of injustice and do nothing   That may be the USDA approach  but it is not an approach that Congress can continue to tolerate    Congress is working to come up with a fair remedy to address this issue   We would like your administration to step up to the plate    We respectfully request that by October 15  you let us know the following   1 The status of the internal investigation  announced by former Secretary Mike Johanns before his resignation last month  of the allegations that USDA employees illegally used federal resources to lobby against legislation   2 The position of your administration on petitioning the court to open the consent decree in order to address the status of late filers    In the Court   s opinion accepting the original settlement  Judge Friedman declared     While the USDA landscape has remained resistant to change for many seasons  the labors of these farmers are beginning to bear fruit   This settlement represents one significant harvest   It is up to the Secretary of Agriculture and other responsible officials at the USDA to fulfill its promises to ensure that this shameful period is never repeated and to bring the USDA into the twenty first century     Though the harvest of the original settlement turned out to be disappointing for too many farmers  we urge the full and immediate support of your Administration to make things right at last    Sincerely  Senator Barack Obama

Date  August 15  2006  Obama Calls on President to Work with Congress to Implement 9 11 Commission Recommendations and Better Protect the United States   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  Tuesday criticized the President and Republican controlled Congress for failing to implement and fund the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission to protect our homeland from future terrorist attacks    Obama said that last week s disclosure of a plot in Great Britain to bring liquid explosives onto airplanes demonstrates that  there are too many glaring gaps in our security efforts here at home     From improving security for our rail and transit systems and our chemical plants  to increasing cargo screening in our airports and ports  the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission have been underfunded  or worse  ignored   Obama wrote   Indeed  the 9 11 Commission gave the Administration dismal marks   5 F s and 12 D s   on the implementation of the Commission s recommendations for homeland security     Obama noted that he and his Senate Democratic colleagues have attempted to increase funding for rail security  aviation security and chemical plant security  but these efforts have been rejected by the majority party in Congress  He also voiced concern that President Bush has submitted budgets that have called for decimating programs for first responders     Now more than ever  we need to come together to address the real security needs of the nation   Obama said   I hope the White House and Congress can work to immediately address the 9 11 Commission recommendations and provide adequate funding to guard against terrorist attacks      For the full text of Obama s letter  please see below     August 15  2006   President George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  DC 20500   Dear Mr  President    Like all Americans  I am grateful for the work of the British intelligence service  combined with the swift response by authorities across the globe  to prevent what could have been a major terrorist attack last week   Unfortunately  in the more than two years since the bipartisan 9 11 Commission released its report  the Administration has failed to implement many of its most important recommendations and still seems to suffer from the  failure of imagination  that the 9 11 Commission identified   As a result  there are too many glaring gaps in our security efforts here at home    From improving security for our rail and transit systems and our chemical plants  to increasing cargo screening in our airports and ports  the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission have been underfunded  or worse  ignored   Indeed  the 9 11 Commission gave the Administration dismal marks   5 F s and 12 D s   on the implementation of the Commission s recommendations for homeland security     Over the past year and a half  I have joined my Democratic colleagues in the Senate on numerous occasions to fight for funding to ensure that Americans are protected from the next generation of terrorist attacks   However  our efforts have been consistently thwarted by the party controlling the White House and Congress    In July 2005  just a week after the London subway bombings  Sen  Byrd proposed adding  1 2 billion for transit security grants and  265 million for rail security to the FY 2006 Homeland Security appropriations bill   Sen  Schumer also offered amendments to improve the screening of air cargo and to track the shipment of hazardous materials   All three amendments were rejected by Senate Republicans  In March 2006  during the consideration of the FY 2007 Budget Resolution  Sen  Lieberman offered a comprehensive amendment to increase homeland security spending that included  1 billion for rail and transit security   752 million for aviation security  and  150 million for chemical security   This amendment was rejected by Senate Republicans   Sen  Menendez also offered an amendment to increase funding for port security by  965 million   This  too  was rejected by Senate Republicans  And just last month  during the consideration of the FY 2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill  Sen  Schumer and Sen  Biden offered amendments to increase funding for rail and transit security  but these amendments were also rejected by Senate Republicans     In short  Congress  failure to adequately fund homeland security has left our nation vulnerable to attacks     The Administration also has submitted budgets that have called for decimating programs for first responders   This year  the Administration s budget proposed eliminating the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program and cutting funds for Emergency Management Performance Grants  both critical sources of homeland funds for our communities      I am also disappointed that the Administration has not taken a lead in pushing for balanced and robust chemical plant security legislation  as Sen  Lautenberg and I have proposed   Five years after September 11  our nation s unguarded chemical plants remain tempting targets for terrorists     In the days after 9 11  the nation was prepared to join together to shore up our defenses and fight the very real terrorist threat we are facing   Unfortunately  that strong sense of national purpose has been tossed aside in favor of partisanship and political brinkmanship   As a result  we are woefully unprepared today on a number of fronts  including rail  port  chemical plant  and cargo security    Now more than ever  we need to come together to address the real security needs of the nation   I hope the White House and Congress can work to immediately address the 9 11 Commission recommendations and provide adequate funding to guard against terrorist attacks      Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator

for Swift Approval of Request for Drought Relief   WASHINGTON   In a letter to U S  Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Dick Durbin  D IL  today asked for swift approval of Illinois  request for drought relief for Illinois farmers    Agriculture is important to Illinois  which is the second largest producer of corn and the leading producer of soybeans   Obama and Durbin wrote   Although we will not fully know the extent of the damage incurred by this year s drought until harvest time  current data suggest that producers will face extreme hardship  Many predict that conditions will worsen as the season progresses  especially in North Eastern and North Central Illinois  These conditions are especially alarming because farmers are at a critical point in the growing season     U S  Department of Agriculture reports show that 55 percent of the corn crop and 36 percent of the soybean crop are rated very poor or poor  Of 102 counties  98 have reported crop damage because of lack of rainfall    Earlier today  Illinois Governor Gov  Blagojevich asked Secretary Johanns to declare each county in Illinois a natural disaster area  If approved  the declaration will qualify farmers for USDA assistance programs  including low interest emergency loans    It is important that the federal programs triggered by a Secretarial Disaster Designation be made available to the state s producers as quickly as possible so that they have a fuller range of options with which to plan their harvesting season  These programs would make operators in both primary and contiguous counties eligible for various types of assistance including emergency disaster loans  crop disaster payments  livestock assistance  and other aid     Full text of the Senator s letter to Secretary Johanns below       July 25  2005     Dear Secretary Johanns      We write in support of Illinois Governor Blagojevich s request of a Secretarial Disaster Designation for the State of Illinois   We recognize that the Secretarial Disaster Designation Process normally lasts from two to three weeks and we request that you place a high priority on reviewing this request      The documentation that you have received from the State of Illinois provides evidence of the severity and extent of Illinois  drought  as well as its effects on this year s harvest   We would like to draw your attention to several facts that demonstrate the challenges that Illinois  farm operators are currently encountering   The period from March to June of this year was the third driest in Illinois since 1895   Precipitation has been almost 50 percent below average statewide rainfall   Combined with unusually high temperatures during the month of June  the lack of precipitation has caused serious harm to this year s harvest   The National Agriculture Statistics Service recently rated 55 percent of the state s corn as very poor or poor and 36 percent of the state s soybeans as very poor to poor      Agriculture is important to Illinois  which is the second largest producer of corn and the leading producer of soybeans    Although we will not fully know the extent of the damage incurred by this year s drought until harvest time  current data suggest that producers will face extreme hardship   Many predict that conditions will worsen as the season progresses  especially in

  These programs would make operators in both primary and contiguous counties eligible for various types of assistance including emergency disaster loans  crop disaster payments  livestock assistance  and other aid      For these reasons  we ask that you favorably consider the State of Illinois  request for Secretarial Disaster Designation   Thank you for your consideration      Sincerely     U S

  Kennedy  Maloney Fight for Workplace Flexibility for Families   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Kennedy  Maloney Fight for Workplace Flexibility for Families Thursday  December  6  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                   CONTACT  Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy   Meghan O    Shaughnessy  Maloney   Jamie Radice  Dodd   Sarah Gegenheimer  Clinton   Amy Brundage  Obama   or Aaron Albright  Miller  WASHINGTON  DC    Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Representative Carolyn Maloney introduced the Working Family Flexibility Act  which will give working Americans the right to request flexible work options in order to balance the demands of their jobs and home life  Senators Dodd  Clinton  Obama  and Congressman George Miller are co sponsoring this bill    This legislation will allow employers and employees to engage in constructive dialogue over modifying where and when employees work so they can find the best solutions to the work life challenges they face    Attached are three letters of endorsement for this legislation from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights  the National Partnership for Women   Families  and the Center for Law and Social Policy   Senator Kennedy said     Our working families deserve a 21st century answer for these 21st century job challenges   Greater flexibility is an essential part of the response   More than 80  of workers would like more flexibility in their jobs   Almost half of them  however  worry that asking for such flexibility will jeopardize their careers   The Working Families Flexibility Act we   re introducing today will give employees the ability to ask for flexible arrangements without fear        This bill would be a big step toward helping employees create a more flexible work schedule and strike a better work family balance   We need to recognize that most American families do not have the luxury of having a stay at home parent  With both parents working  and millions of single parents working  we need workplaces that can help people be both good employees and good parents  Countries that have already introduced balanced work family policies find they are a win win   they help create stable families  a more productive workforce  and positive economic outcomes     said Congresswoman Maloney     This legislation marks the beginning of an important conversation about the needs of American workers as they try to juggle the demands of their job with the needs of their families     said Senator Dodd      I am pleased to join Senator Kennedy in introducing a bill that will help make this juggling act a little easier   Flexibility meets the needs of employees and employers alike and is an essential element of any successful work environment      Between trying to make ends meet and carving out time to care for their young children and aging relatives  parents across America are often stretched thin and need flexibility at work   Senator Clinton said   I m pleased to join Senator Kennedy in introducing this important piece of legislation to support our nation s working families    We ve heard a lot of talk about family values but this important legislation would actually help families with the increasingly challenging job of earning a living and raising kids or caring for an ill relative   Senator Obama said   The demands of the global economy mean that Americans are working harder and harder  If we re going to have strong families  we need to make it easier for Americans to work more flexible hours      American workers shouldn   t have to choose between their financial security and the important needs of their family   Family friendly policies work for both workers and their employers by increasing recruitment and retention rates  decreasing absenteeism  and improving productivity     said Congressman Miller   SUMMARY OF WORKING FAMILIES FLEXIBILITY ACT   The Working Families Flexibility Act gives employees the right to request flexible work options   This legislation will ensure that working Americans can ask their employer for modified schedules so they can balance the demands of their jobs and their home life   The legislation is patterned on similar laws in Europe that have been implemented with great success   Under this legislation  An employee may request to modify his or her hours  schedule  or work location  Employees and employers will engage in an interactive process to discuss the employee   s needs and how to address them with no or minimal disruption to the employer   s business   Employers who deny a request must explain the grounds for the denial   Employees who make requests are protected from retaliation   Small businesses are exempt from the law   The Department of Labor will develop regulations to smoothly administer the process  while ensuring the protection of employees    legal rights

legislative action  restrict HHS funding if list not provided within one week WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today called on Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  Secretary Michael Leavitt to release the list of the 128    special focus  facilities  the list of worst performing nursing homes in the country  Recent press accounts have reported that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services refuses to make the list of underperforming nursing homes public  but has shared the information with lobbyists who represent the nursing home industry  Obama has requested HHS make this information public immediately and stop withholding this information from America   s seniors and their families   If Secretary Leavitt does not comply  Obama has promised to take legislative action  below is a copy of the letter  December 6  2007 The Honorable Michael Leavitt  Secretary  Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Ave   SW  Washington  DC  20201 Dear Secretary Leavitt  I am writing to express my serious objections to the withholding of critical information about nursing home conditions from America   s senior citizens  An estimated 1 5 million residents live in approximately 16 000 nursing homes in the United States   This year  federal  state  and local governments will spend  82 billion on nursing home care  of which  56 5 billion will come from the federal government through Medicare and Medicaid   All nursing homes that receive federal funding are subject to federal regulation and annual inspections   Under federal law  these inspections are a matter of public record and are made available to nursing home residents and their family members  and summaries of the inspection reports are posted on your department   s Nursing Home Compare website  www medicare gov NHCompare   These federal inspection and public disclosure requirements ensure that nursing home residents are receiving the high quality of care that they deserve   Given the importance of protecting one of our nation   s most vulnerable populations  I was disturbed to learn that your department is withholding information about some of the worst performing nursing homes in the country    According to press accounts  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has compiled a list of 128    special focus facilities        that are among the worst performing nursing homes in the country   These facilities are ones that have consistently been cited for serious violations of health and safety regulations     violations such as improper medical care  preventable falls and accidents  pressure sores  serious neglect  and physical abuse   If these violations are not corrected  the facility could be subject to penalties and termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs    However  of the 128 worst performing facilities  only 54 of these nursing homes have been publicly identified  one of these facilities is in my home state of Illinois  1   The remaining 74 facilities have not been disclosed to the public  even though this information would be invaluable not only to current residents of those facilities but also to potential residents and their family members   It is incomprehensible why the complete list of 128 facilities     which is determined on the basis of publicly available inspection reports     would not be made public  Although the names of the 128    special focus facilities        have not been made available to the public  press accounts suggest that the complete list has been provided to the American Health Care Association  the main lobbying organization for the nursing home industry   Providing information about poorly performing nursing homes to the lobbyists who represent those facilities  and not to the senior citizens who would most benefit from this information  is outrageous and yet another example of how this Administration has placed the corporate interest before the public interest  I call on you to immediately release the names of all 128    special focus facilities          If you refuse to do so  I will pursue all possible legislative actions to compel the release of this information   Please notify my office by Thursday  December 13  2007  as to whether you will comply with this request    Sincerely     Barack Obama  United States Senator   1  Although press accounts indicate that the names of 54 facilities have been made public  the list posted on the HHS website only includes information about 52 facilities                                 Pursuant

  Obama Questions Justice Department Ruling to Pre Approve Restrictive Georgia Voter ID Law   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Questions Justice Department Ruling to Pre Approve Restrictive Georgia Voter ID Law Wednesday  November 30  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  November 30  2005   Obama Questions Justice Department Ruling to Pre Approve Restrictive Georgia Voter ID Law   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Christopher J  Dodd  D CT  today sent a letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales questioning the Department of Justice s  DOJ  pre approval of a Georgia law requiring residents to show a photo ID before voting despite the objections of four out of five career DOJ officials  The law was later ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in Georgia and the Eleventh Circuit United States Court of Appeals upheld the ruling    It is troubling that despite the objections of four out of five its own career employees  the Department of Justice would pre approve a law that would make it more difficult for minority  disabled  elderly and low income Americans to vote   said Obama   The law has since been ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge and that ruling was upheld by the 11th Circuit  making it clear that the Department of Justice should have listened to its own staff     The Voting Rights Act of 1965 requires Georgia to submit any voting rule changes for review to the Justice Department to determine if they would adversely affect minority groups  The Justice department can then immediately stop the proposed changes or it can issue a  pre clearance  letter  which would allow it to proceed    According to an August 25  2005 DOJ memorandum released to the Washington Post  four of the five career staffers charged with analyzing the Georgia law recommended that DOJ oppose pre clearance of the program   These attorneys argued that the State of Georgia failed to prove  as required under the Voting Rights Act  that the measure would not unduly hinder the ability of minority voters to cast their ballots      I agree that there are real problems in our election systems that demand real answers   said Obama   But there is no evidence to suggest that there is a rash of voters appearing at the polls claiming to be someone they are not  In our democracy  the goal should be to encourage eligible voters to vote  not create new barriers to make it more difficult for some of our most vulnerable citizens to exercise their most basic right      At least 150 000 senior citizens in Georgia do not have government issued photo identification  Currently  Georgia has only 56 locations in its 159 counties where people can get this photo identification   and Atlanta  one of America s largest cities  is not one of them  The ID s would cost up to  35  which the court ruled would constitute a poll tax     In September  Senator Obama introduced a joint resolution with Georgia Congressman John Lewis  D GA  and Senator Chris Dodd  D CT  expressing their belief that any law requiring a photo ID to vote would put an undue burden on voters  The resolution was in response to the Department of Justice s clearance of the Georgia statute and the Carter Baker Commission on Election Reform s recommendation of a national ID requirement       November 30  2005   The Honorable Alberto Gonzales  United States Attorney General  U S  Department of Justice  950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20530 0001   Dear Attorney General Gonzales    We are writing to express our serious concerns about the decision of the Department of Justice  DOJ  to  pre clear  the recently enacted Georgia voting law pursuant to the requirements of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965     As you know  despite DOJ s pre clearance of the law  a federal district judge temporarily stayed the Georgia law on the grounds that it would disproportionately affect minority voters and likely violate the Voting Rights Act and the U S  Constitution   The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has upheld that decision      The Department has attempted to characterize its pre clearance decision as a joint conclusion by both career and political officials   According to an August 25  2005  memorandum released by the Washington Post  however  four of the five career staffers charged with analyzing the Georgia law recommended that DOJ oppose pre clearance of the program   These attorneys argued that the State of Georgia failed to prove  as required under the Voting Rights Act  that the measure would not unduly hinder the ability of minority voters to cast their ballots      Despite the well reasoned recommendation of these career employees  the DOJ disregarded the employees  recommendation and pre cleared the law the next day      The same Washington Post story indicates that some former and current DOJ employees have claimed that political appointees also overruled career lawyers in approving redistricting measures in Texas and Mississippi   We understand that DOJ spokesperson  Eric Holland has dismissed claims that the August 25th memo is of any significance  claiming   The early draft       does not represent the quality of factual and legal analysis that the Justice Department expects in a final product    Nonetheless  we are concerned that the Georgia pre clearance decision is just the latest example of a trend within DOJ in which political appointees have ignored the decisions and recommendations of career attorneys in voting rights cases      In order for Congress to conduct oversight of DOJ s enforcement powers with respect to voting rights and election law  we request that you provide us with all DOJ documents regarding  discussing or otherwise relevant to the pre clearance of the Georgia law  including any documents discussing the decision to disregard the August 25th memorandum   We look forward to your response within the next two weeks    Sincerely

  Senators Reintroduce Initiative to Reduce Gasoline Consumption by Half a Trillion Gallons   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senators Reintroduce Initiative to Reduce Gasoline Consumption by Half a Trillion Gallons Monday  March  5  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                 Contact  Ben LaBolt  202  228 5511 Legislation Would Increase Fuel Economy Standards for First Time in over 20 Years WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Richard G  Lugar  R IN   Joseph Biden  D DE   Gordon Smith  R OR   Arlen Specter  R PA   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   and Norm Coleman  R MN  today reintroduced legislation that would reduce U S  gasoline consumption by nearly half a trillion gallons by 2028 and greatly decrease our dependence on foreign oil      Setting America on a course towards energy independence will bolster our security  insulate our economy  and keep our environment livable     said Senator Obama      Now that President Bush agrees it is time to raise fuel economy standards  Congress must act to decrease our gasoline consumption and invest in the alternative fuels of the future          Energy is fundamentally reshaping the power balance in the world  largely to the detriment of the United States   The hundreds of billions of dollars spent on oil imports each year weakens the U S  economy  enriches hostile regimes  and is used by some to support terrorism   It is incomprehensible that fuel economy has been stagnant when the costs of oil dependence are so high   The 110th Congress must reform fuel economy standards as part of a comprehensive energy strategy that is in the interest of U S  national security     said Senator Lugar  Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee       If it was not clear before  it is now   domestic energy policy is at the center of our foreign policy     said Senator Joseph R  Biden  Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee     For our national security we have to begin the transition to alternative fuels  We can   t do that without making progress on fuel economy by upgrading to a better system that combines protection for U S  automobile manufacturing jobs with predictable increases in fuel efficiency standards for cars  SUVs and light trucks          Consumers are demanding fuel efficient vehicles and I believe American ingenuity is up to the task     Senator Smith said      The proper mix of fuel economy standards and tax incentives can help auto manufactures roll out a durable and safe car  truck  or SUV   This is also a national security issue   We can   t keep buying oil from countries that use the profits to shoot bullets back at us            I am pleased to join my colleagues in again cosponsoring legislation that will improve vehicle fuel economy     Senator Specter said      This legislation will help the United States reduce our dependence on foreign oil and act as a responsible environmental steward by reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions          Improving vehicle fuel efficiency is an important step in helping reduce our country   s dependency on foreign oil   It   s time to investigate serious ways to improve fuel efficiency  and I believe this bill is a great start     Senator Bingaman  chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee  said       Our addiction to foreign oil is a threat to both our economic and national security     said Senator Coleman     It   s time we take the decisions about our energy supply out of the hands of foreign nations  By coupling a sensible fuel efficiency standard that will push technology to the marketplace with strong tax incentives  we can put American on the road to energy independence      America spends  800 million a day  or  300 billion annually  on its 20 million barrel a day oil habit  Passenger vehicles alone burn 8 million gallons of oil each day  Because we import 60 percent of our oil  much of it from the Middle East  our dependence on oil is also a national security issue  As oil prices have exceeded  70 a barrel in recent years and with total U S  petroleum use estimated to increase 23 percent over the next 20 years  we must act now to prevent a future energy crisis  But while it   s clear that increasing fuel economy standards is a crucial part of any effort to reduce our consumption of foreign oil  efforts to raise them have been stalled for 20 years   The Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2007 seeks to break the decades long logjam on increasing fuel economy standards by taking a new  more flexible approach  The bill charges the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration  NHTSA  to create regular annual increases in fuel economy with a target of 4 percent     roughly one mile per gallon     each year   The experts at NHTSA will base these standards on attributes of a vehicle such as size and weight  and will be able to revise the annual increase if they conclude that the target cannot be reached with current technology or without compromising the safety of the entire fleet  or is not cost effective when compared to the economic and geopolitical value of a gallon of gasoline saved   The Fuel Economy Reform Act reflects the recommended approach of the Energy Security Leadership Council   s 2006 report on how to secure America   s energy future   This legislation flips the current debate about increasing fuel economy standards on its head  from a debate about whether standards will be raised to presumption that they will be raised     In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop more fuel efficient vehicles  the legislation also provides generous tax incentives for companies to retool parts and assembly plants  This would strengthen the U S  auto industry by allowing them to compete with foreign hybrid  E 85 and other fuel efficient vehicles  The bill would also allow more Americans to benefit from a tax credit for the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles by lifting the current cap that only makes eligible the first 60 000 buyers per manufacturer each year   If this 4 percent per year improvement is maintained for 20 years  this bill would reduce gasoline consumption by 549 billion gallons  If gasoline were just  2 50 per gallon  that means consumers would save  1 372 trillion at the pump by 2028   The Fuel Economy Reform Act would also provide fairness and flexibility to domestic automakers by establishing different standards for different types of cars  Currently  manufacturers have to meet broad standards over their whole fleet of cars  This disadvantages companies like Ford and General Motors that produce full lines of small and large cars and trucks rather than manufacturers that only sell small cars   This Congress provides a window of opportunity to achieve fuel economy reform   President Bush signaled his commitment to lowering oil consumption  in part through fuel economy reform  in this year   s State of the Union Address   In December 2006  the Energy Security Leadership Council noted the Fuel Economy Reform Act as their recommended approach to secure America   s energy future       We need to act now if we want to prevent an even greater energy crisis in the future     said Obama     This bipartisan  common sense approach will finally harness the technology we already have to save Americans money at the pump and save America from a dependence on the world   s most unstable  undemocratic regimes          The Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2007 A New Approach to Increasing CAFE Standards  A New Approach   The Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2007 seeks to break the logjam on establishing greater vehicle fuel economy by establishing a targeted 4 percent increase each year in Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standards   a rate that the National Academy of Sciences has determined is possible   unless the experts at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  justify a deviation in that rate by proving that the increase is technologically unachievable  cannot maintain overall fleet safety  or is not cost effective when comparing with the economic and geopolitical value of a gallon of gasoline saved   Higher CAFE Standards   If the 4 percent per year target is met for ten years after the continuous provision improvements go into effect  this bill will save 1 3 million barrels of oil per day and 20 billion gallons of gasoline per year   If gasoline is just  2 50 per gallon  consumers will save  50 billion at the pump in 2018 alone  By 2028  Americans will have saved a total of 549 billion gallons of gasoline and cut global warming pollution by 6 094 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent gases    Flexibility for Manufacturers  The Fuel Economy Reform Act also provides fairness and flexibility to domestic auto makers by establishing different standards for different types of cars   Currently manufacturers have to meet broad standards over their whole fleet of cars   The bill creates further flexibility by giving NHTSA the authority to allow companies to earn credit for improving fuel efficiency beyond the CAFE standard in one type of car  and using those credits to meet goals for other vehicle models   Because technological advances may affect manufacturers over time  the bill instructs the Energy Department  Environmental Protection Agency  and National Academy of Sciences  to study ways to reform the regulatory structure of this approach in 2016    Incentives for Fuel Economy  In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop advanced technology vehicles  this legislation provides generous tax incentives for companies to retool parts and assembly plants   This will strengthen the U S  auto industry by allowing them to compete with foreign hybrid  E 85 and other fuel efficient vehicles   The bill would lift the current 60 000 per manufacturer cap on buyer tax credits to allow more Americans to buy ultra efficient vehicles   The Problem    America is Addicted to Foreign Oil   America   s 20 million barrel a day habit costs our economy  800 million a day  or  300 billion annually   We use 8 million barrels of oil each day on passenger vehicles   Because we import 60 percent of our oil  much of it from the Middle East  our dependence on oil is also a national security issue   Oil recently has reached as high as  75 a barrel and  3 00 a gallon at the pump  during the next 20 years total US petroleum demand will increase 23 percent   CAFE   Initial Success Followed by 20 Years of Little Progress   In response to the OPEC oil embargo in the 1970s  Congress enacted CAFE standards  the first ever requirements for gas mileage   NHTSA raised the average gas mileage of cars and trucks from just over 14 miles per gallon  mpg  in 1976 to 27 5 mpg for cars and 20 7 mpg for trucks by 1985   By enacting these standards  the country saves approximately 3 million barrels of oil per day  making it the most successful energy saving measure ever adopted   Unfortunately  since 1985 the NHTSA has been largely unable to increase standards   The CAFE standard for cars has remained frozen at 27 5 mpg for 20 years   The standard for trucks only increased by 2 mpg to 22 2 mpg for 2007   Over those 20 years  the auto industry has developed numerous innovations  which allowed fuel economy standards to rise to 45 miles per gallon in Japan   Congressional Deadlock   Since 1985  Congress has considered numerous bills to increase fuel efficiency  without significant gains in CAFE standards   Recently  there has been a logjam between those who want Congress to mandate specific increases in CAFE standards  and those who want the rate of improvement to be determined by NHTSA   This approach ensures a rate of improvement of 4 percent annually and allows NHTSA to adjust that rate

Barack Obama  D IL   John Kerry  D MA   Pete Domenici  R NM  and Chuck Hagel  R NE  sent the following letter to the Assistant Defense Secretary for Health Affairs  Dr  S  Ward Casscells  calling on him to provide comprehensive information on eye injuries sustained by service members in Iraq and Afghanistan   According to the President   s Commission on Care for America   s Returning Wounded Warriors  48 cases of blinded service members have been reported  while other estimates show that the total number of vision related complications exceeds 1 000     especially when vision impairment resulting from Traumatic Brain Injuries  TBIs  is considered   However  based on current available information  there is a lack of comprehensive eye injury data as well as questions about the accuracy of these numbers   In continuing efforts to provide the best available care for our wounded warriors  it is imperative that we have an accurate system of accounting for these eye injuries so there can be sufficient planning and treatment    In the letter  the senators ask the Pentagon to provide the total number of eye injuries sustained in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  an estimate of the total number of eye injuries sustained that did not result in a medical evacuation  the number of cases of TBIs that also contained a diagnosis of a vision impairment  the number of eye injuries that required surgery in military medical facilities  and the number of blinded service members referred for either outpatient or inpatient Department of Veterans Affairs Blind Rehabilitative Services or private agency rehabilitation      The very least we owe our men and women in uniform is the best health care we can provide     said Senator Obama      Whether these heroes are suffering from eye injuries or traumatic brain injuries that can lead to vision impairment  we have a commitment to provide them with the highest quality medical care both in combat and once they return home   The fact is  the story of eye injuries in this war has gone largely untold   To fully care for our veterans  we need to have a comprehensive understanding of the number of veterans affected  and I hope we receive this information from the Pentagon in a timely and efficient way         The best military medicine in the world is saving lives on the battlefield  but an antiquated health care system is failing our soldiers when they come home with complex eye and brain injuries  which are the hallmark wounds of this war     said Senator Kerry     Perfecting the science to treat these wounds means nothing without the planning and resources to get care to our soldiers at home   The military and veterans healthcare system must be capable of diagnosing  treating and providing rehabilitative services for those that need it most          It is important that we fully understand the extent to which eye injuries are being experienced by our men and women in uniform   Only then can we ensure that we are providing the necessary resources to help address the needs of our veterans     said Senator Pete Domenici  The text of the letter is below  The Honorable S  Ward Casscells  M D   Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs   1200 Defense Pentagon   Washington DC 20301 1200 Dear Dr  Casscells   We write to request information regarding the prevalence of eye injuries sustained by U S  military personnel serving in Iraq and Afghanistan   According to the President   s Commission on Care for America   s Returning Wounded Warriors  48 cases of blinded service members have been reported  The Veterans Benefits Administration is currently providing service connection disability for 230 OIF and OEF veterans who have been discharged with some vision injuries  And still other estimates show that the number of vision related complications exceeds 1 000     especially when the vision impairment resulting from Traumatic Brain Injuries is taken into account    Based on the information available to us  we have concerns about not only the lack of comprehensive data with respect to eye injuries  but the accuracy of these numbers   In our continuing efforts to provide the best available care for our wounded warriors  it is imperative that we have an accurate system of accounting for these eye injuries  If we do not understand the magnitude of the problem  it is impossible to properly plan for and invest in adequate treatment  It is for this reason that we respectfully request the following information for the period October 1  2002 through September 2007  broken down by quarter    The total number of eye injuries  force wide  sustained in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  including the total number of such injuries that resulted in a medical evacuation from theater   The Department   s estimate of the total number of eye injuries sustained in combat but that did not result in a medical evacuation from theater   The number of cases of Traumatic Brain Injuries  TBI   s  that also contained a diagnosis of a vision impairment or other vision dysfunction due to TBI injury   The number of eye injuries that required eye surgery in Army  Navy  or Air Force medical facilities  and  The number of blinded service members referred for either outpatient or inpatient Department of Veterans Affairs Blind Rehabilitative Services or private agency rehabilitation   We know you would agree that our nation   s men and women in uniform deserve nothing but our best efforts in understanding  diagnosis and treating these eye injuries  Thank you

Obama Calls for Investigation into Series of Toy Recalls Wednesday  September  5  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5566  Asks for Senate Hearing to Address Growing Problem of Lead Paint in Toys   WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today asked the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to investigate the series of toy recalls caused by lead paint in children   s toys sold in the United States  Yesterday  Mattel announced its third recall of toys manufactured in China in less than two months  Obama has introduced the Lead Free Toys Act  S  1306  to provide the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  with the authority to ban children   s products containing lead as hazardous substances   Obama is also the sponsor of the Lead Poisoning Reduction Act  S  1811  which requires that all non home based child care facilities  including Head Start program locations and kindergarten classrooms  be lead safe within five years  In August  Senator Obama called on President Bush to immediately nominate a chairman to the CPSC who will be a forceful advocate for the interests of American parents and requested a funding increase for the Commission to protect America   s children from lead contaminated toys  Below is a copy of the letter Senator Obama sent today to Chairman Lieberman and Senator Collins  September 5  2007 The Honorable Joseph I  Lieberman           Chairman           The Honorable Susan M  Collins  Ranking Member 340 Dirksen Senate Office Building  Senate Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee  Washington  D C   20510                                     Dear Chairman Lieberman and Senator Collins  I read with great interest Senator Collins    press release last week that her staff would be looking into the problem of lead contaminated children products in the United States   Given the scope of this problem     and the millions of Chinese made toys recalled in recent months     I applaud Senator Collins    initiative and leadership    However  I believe that the importance of this issue merits a full investigation by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee   The safety of our children is a top priority  and the first step we must take to reverse this dangerous trend is to get the facts   That   s why I believe that the Committee should examine whether federal agencies     in particular the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC      have taken all necessary steps to protect our children from dangerous products manufactured abroad and  if not  whether these agencies require additional statutory authority     Just yesterday  Mattel  Inc  announced a recall of 700 000 Chinese made toys  including Barbie accessory toys and Big Big World 6 in 1 Bongo Band toys because they violate federal lead paint standards   This recall marks Mattel   s third major recall in less than two months  which highlights the seriousness and the scope of this problem and the risk to children  The CPSC leads our national efforts to safeguard our children from potentially dangerous objects   However  handicapped by inadequate funding  a staffing shortage  and the lack of a chairman  the Commission has dragged its feet in aggressively addressing the problem of lead in toys   In both the 109th and 110th Congress  I have introduced the Lead Free Toys Act  which requires the CPSC to issue regulations classifying any children   s product containing more than a trace amount of lead as a banned hazardous substance under the Hazardous Substances Act and to issue standards for lead reduction in electronics   In addition to this legislative effort  I have sent letters expressing my concerns about lead contaminated toys to the White House  the United States Trade Representative  and the Toy Industry Association and requested information about their efforts to protect American consumers from these dangerous products   I have also worked closely with Congressman Waxman to investigate the prevalence of this problem   In December 2006  we released a report showing that a number of the souvenirs sold in the U S  Capitol gift shops contained high levels of lead  these items have since been removed from store shelves  If you agree that a Committee sanctioned investigation is appropriate  please let me know if my staff can be of assistance   If you have any questions  you can contact my health policy advisor Dora Hughes at 224 2854   Thank you for attention to this important matter    Sincerely     Barack Obama  United States Senator

 Legislation to Drastically Improve Security at Chemical Plants Thursday  March 30  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Durbin Contact  Sandra Abrevaya   202  224 7115    Date  March 30  2006  Illinois and New Jersey Senators Introduce Legislation to Drastically Improve Security at Chemical Plants Two Plants in Chicago Area Could Threaten More than 1 million People   CHICAGO   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Dick Durbin  D IL   Frank Lautenberg  D NJ  and Bob Menendez  D NJ  today introduced legislation to drastically improve security at our nation s chemical plants     There may be no greater failure of our government than the fact that we have done almost nothing to secure one of America s most vulnerable targets   the 15 000 chemical plants in America   said Obama   These chemical plants represent some of the most attractive targets for terrorists looking to cause widespread death and destruction  Despite this  security at our chemical plants is voluntary   left to the individual plant owners  While many chemical plant owners have taken steps to beef up security  too many have not  In Illinois  there have been recent reports by ABC 7 in Chicago of chemical plants with dilapidated fences  insufficient guard forces  and unprotected tanks of hazardous chemicals  These plants are basically stationary weapons of mass destruction  Their security is light  their facilities are easily entered  and their contents are deadly      Chemical plant security is a serious problem and the combination of lax security and deadly chemicals is a toxic mix   said Durbin    Illinois has more facilities that store extremely hazardous materials then any other state  with over 100 000 pounds of hazardous substances stored in over 600 facilities   It is unacceptable that we have chemical plant facilities in our state and in other parts of this country that anyone can stroll onto   This bill puts a lock on the door and real fencing in the yard     There are 111 facilities in the United States where a worst case scenario attack on a chemical plant could threaten more than one million people  according to the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   Two of these facilities are within Chicago s city limits  Illinois has at least 11 facilities where a large scale chemical release could threaten more than a million people    The Chemical Safety and Security Act of 2006 would replace current weak voluntary chemical plant security standards with a clear set of federal regulations that all plants must abide by  Plants that are considered a high risk to large population areas or critical infrastructure would face more stringent standards    Plant owners and employees would work together to tailor their security plans to address each individual facility s vulnerabilities  but they would face tough penalties for noncompliance  The bill would also protect the right of states to establish security standards that fit local needs so that states like New Jersey that have been leaders in chemical security do not see their current laws weakened    The bill addresses all methods to reduce risk  including physical security such as security forces  perimeter defenses  hazard mitigation and emergency response  But the bill also requires the use of safer technologies to reduce the attractiveness of chemical plants as a target  This concept  known as Inherently Safer Technology  involves methods such as changing the flow of chemical processes to avoid dangerous chemical byproducts  reducing the pressures or temperatures of chemical reactions to minimize the risk of explosions  reducing inventories of dangerous chemicals and replacing dangerous chemicals with benign ones  Each one of these methods reduces the danger that chemical plants pose to our communities and makes them less appealing targets for terrorists     Safety regulations can be implemented in a way that is flexible enough for the industry yet stringent enough to protect the American people   Senator Obama said   It is long past time to put the security of our nation ahead of special interests or politics   Now is the time to act to protect our citizens      This is a comprehensive bill that will satisfy the need for tighter security at chemical plants with a minimum of disruption for chemical manufacturers   said Durbin    It not only increases onsite security  it calls for stricter rules on chemical production and protects employees who expose security risks   We need tough  enforceable standards for chemical plant security and this bill will move us much closer to that goal     Lautenberg Obama  The Chemical Security and Safety Act  Establishes General Duty to Improve Security at Facilities Storing Threshold Amounts of Chemicals  Requires chemical facilities to take steps to improve security  including improving barriers  containment and mitigation  safety training  and  where possible  use safer technology   Known as  Inherently Safer Technology   or IST  includes using less toxic chemicals and employing safer procedures   Identifies High Priority Chemical Facilities  Directs the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  to work with the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   as well as state and local agencies  to identify  high priority  chemical facilities that would receive priority oversight   Prioritization would be based on the threat posed to public health and safety due to proximity to population centers  type and amount of chemicals involved  and threats to national security and critical infrastructure    Requires High Priority Facilities to Conduct Vulnerability Assessments and Develop and Implement Response Plans  Directs DHS to work with EPA  as well as with state and local agencies  to establish regulations to require each high priority facility to do the following   Conduct a vulnerability hazard assessment  Develop a prevention  preparedness and response plan that incorporates the assessment results  and includes actions to reduce vulnerabilities by improving security measures and  where possible  uses safer technology   In developing the plans  facility operators must consult with facility employees and local first responders  Participate in periodic scheduled and unscheduled site visits and inspections to assure compliance with security plans and other requirements  Establish safety and security advisory committees at each facility that includes employees and managers  Conduct drills to practice prevention  preparedness and response plans   Provide employees with security training every year   The bill would establish an information clearinghouse to disseminate best practices for risk assessment  security planning  and the use of Inherently Safer Technology   Protects State Laws  Protects state and local government s right to establish chemical security and safety requirements more stringent than national standards   Protects Whistleblowers  Protects employees who report dangerous gaps in security to the Department of Homeland Security   Protects Sensitive Information  Protects security information from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and other state or local disclosure laws    Inherently Safer Technology  IST   Widely Accepted   The concept of Inherently Safer Technology  IST  was developed in 1977 by chemical industry insiders who were seeking innovative ways to reduce risk     The Department of Homeland Security s July 2004 draft Chemical Sector Specific Plan states that inherently safer chemistry and engineering practices can prevent or delay a terrorist incident  noting that it is important to make sure that facility owners and operators consider alternate ways to reduce risk  such as inherently safer design  implementing just in time manufacturing  or replacing high risk chemicals with safer alternatives    The Department of Justice recognized the value of IST in introducing a methodology to assess chemical facilities  vulnerabilities in 2002    New Jersey requires chemical facilities to review the practicability of adopting inherently safer technology in its 2005 chemical security law    Industry uses IST in its volunteer security standards   The American Chemistry Council s  Responsible Care R  Security Code of Management Practices  requires that chemical sources take  into account inherently safer approaches to process design  in implementing security measures   Options to Reduce Risk  Alternative reaction routes or plant layout  the sequence of reactions in the process may reduce or eliminate a hazardous exposure   For example  in producing the insecticide Carbaryl  one can change the sequence of steps in the reactions process so that the potentially dangerous methyl isocyanate is eliminated as an intermediate product   Simplification  eliminate unnecessary complexity so workers can comprehend the process and recognize hazardous circumstances   Energy limitation  the energy potential   whether electrical  chemical or kinetic   is reduced in order to reduce the hazard of an exposure   For example  reducing temperature or pressure in reactions can reduce potentials for explosions   Substitution  safer materials or processes are substituted for more hazardous substances or processes   For example  substituting an inherently toxic substance for one that is biologically benign   Intensification or minimization  avoid the catastrophic potential of an exposure by storing small amounts of a substance   For example  storing less volume of flammable chemicals   Economically Viable   A recent study by an MIT Professor published in the journal Safety Science identified more than two dozen feasible inherent safety alternatives   The majority of those options were shown to have payback times of less than two years  Overall  25 percent of the options were implemented during the study   Examples from across the Country  In Washington  DC  the Blue Plains Sewage Plant switched from volatile chlorine gas to less volatile sodium hypochlorite bleach  which has far less potential for airborne off site impact   In Cheshire  Ohio  American Electric Power selected a urea based pollution control system rather than one involving large scale storage of ammonia that would have endangered the surrounding community   In Cuyahoga County  Ohio  ALCOA reduced its potential off site impact by working with local emergency planners and ending on site storage of hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid   There are 148 gasoline refineries in the country   Fifty of them use hydrogen fluoride to increase the octane  Hydrogen fluoride is highly toxic  If released into the air  the liquid turns into a heavy  low lying gas  In the last ten years  many refineries have switched to safer alternatives like sulfuric acid or modified hydrogen fluoride that does not turn into a gas   Shifting Risk Rather than Eliminating Risk   There are few examples where shifting technologies appears safer  but actually increases risk  For example  at times  the only viable replacement for a toxic chemical is one that is more flammable or that risks public health   These examples are a minority and can be managed when IST is reviewed on a facility by facility basis and balanced against increases in overall threat                                     ,Obama

Calif   and Gordon Smith  R Ore   today led a bipartisan group of Senators that introduced a resolution condemning the violence in Tibet  The resolution also calls on China to open substantive dialogue with His Holiness  the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet    The resolution is cosponsored by Senators Joseph Biden  D Del    Amy Klobuchar  D Minn    Sherrod Brown  D Ohio   Elizabeth Dole  R N

Charles Schumer  D N Y    and Patty Murray  D Wash     The resolution introduced today comes in the wake of protests that have swept across Tibet  and reports that these protests have been met with overwhelming force and a crackdown by the Chinese government  Chinese and Tibetan sources report dozens of fatalities  and the arrest of more than 1 000 protesters in the Tibet Autonomous Region and surrounding Tibetan areas of China    As a friend of China and the Dalai Lama  I am saddened to see the situation in Tibet deteriorate to this point   Senator Feinstein said   Violence cannot solve this matter   The United States must use its influence to bring the Government of China and the people of Tibet together to begin the process of reconciliation and dialogue    In the 1990s  I carried three letters to President Jiang Zemin from the Dalai Lama requesting a face to face meeting   Six rounds of talks since 2002 between the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China and representatives of His Holiness have not yielded any results   So  I urge the leadership in China to begin the process of open substantive dialogue with the Dalai Lama on meaningful Tibetan religious and cultural autonomy within the People s Republic of China     Senator Smith said   China s violent crackdown on the people of Tibet is inexcusable  They have long sought acceptance among the ranks of global leaders  but the methodical and brutal oppression of free speech  political protest and the repression of an entire ethnic population are not the actions of a world leader  The Chinese government must act immediately to end the violence    It is critical that the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama engage in a mutually respectful dialogue to restore peace and stability in Tibet   said Senator Biden   By engaging in talks with Tibet instead of violence  President Hu would gain the opportunity to speak the motto of the Beijing Olympics    One World  One Dream    to the entire international community  I can think of no greater symbol of peace than to have President Hu Jin tao and the Dalai Lama jointly attend the opening ceremony of the games  united in their commitment to promote genuine reconciliation on the Tibetan plateau   Specifically  the resolution  Condemns the violence in Tibet and calls for restraint by the Government of the People s Republic of China and the people of Tibet  Calls for a dialogue between the leadership of the Government of China and His Holiness the Dalai Lama on meaningful religious and cultural autonomy for Tibet within China and urges that these discussions take place with all deliberate speed   Calls for the release of individuals who protested in a peaceful manner and for medical care for those injured and wounded in the violence that followed the protests   Calls on the Government of China to cease its efforts to enter monasteries to  reeducate  monks and nuns  to respect the right of the people of Tibet to speak of the Dalai Lama and possess his photograph  and to respect and protect basic human rights  as provided in the Constitution of the People s Republic of China   Calls on the Government of China to honor its commitment to allow international journalists free access to China from mid 2007 to October 17  2008   Calls on the Government of China to provide a full accounting of the March 2008 protests in Tibet  the response of the Government of China  and the manner and number of detentions and deaths that occurred following the protests   Calls on the United States Department of State to fully implement the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002  22 USC 6901 note   including the stipulation that the Secretary of State  seek to establish an office in Lhasa  Tibet to monitor political  economic  and cultural developments in Tibet   and also to provide consular protection and citizen services in emergencies  and Urges that the agreement to permit China to open further diplomatic missions in the United States should be contingent upon the establishment of a United States Government office in Lhasa  Tibet    China s crackdown on the people of Tibet is inexcusable   Senator Brown said   Beijing has long sought a place at the table of global leaders  But systematic and violent repression of free speech  political protest and the eradication of ethnic culture  religion  and language are not the acts of a world leader  nor a country we should be striving to open to free trade  President Hu Jintao must take immediate steps to end the violent repression  open up to western media and release all political prisoners    In order to reach its full potential as a global leader  China must respect human rights and religious freedom of all its citizens   said Senator Cantwell    Dialogue with the Dalai Lama is essential   Senator Menendez said   The people of Tibet deserve communication  not crackdowns from the Chinese government  If they choose to voice their opinions  they deserve the right to be treated with civility and humanity  Instead  they are met with deadly violence  It s time for the dialogue to begin and the Dalai Lama to be included     Every day we learn about the tragedies facing the Tibetan people  and I condemn the use of violence to confront peaceful protests   said Senator Obama    It s time that the Chinese government respect and protect the basic human rights  religion  and culture of the Tibetan people   Senator Dole said   Particularly as the world prepares to turn its attention to the summer 2008 Beijing Olympic Games  China should be taking steps to improve its human rights and religious freedom record   Unfortunately  China instead has engaged in a harsh repression of the people of Tibet  adding to their already negative influence in the crackdown in Burma   The violence needs to end     Following is the text of the resolution introduced today   Whereas  beginning on March 10  2008  Tibetans and Tibetan Buddhist monks began demonstrations in Lhasa  the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region in the People s Republic of China  Whereas those protests spread to elsewhere in the Tibet Autonomous Region and to Tibetan autonomous areas in the Sichuan  Gansu  and Qinghan provinces of China  Whereas  long suppressed resentment prompted violent clashes between demonstrators and government forces in the streets of Lhasa  resulting in innocent civilian casualties  the burning of buildings  and extensive property damage  Whereas Chinese and Tibetan sources report dozens of fatalities  and the arrest of more than 1 000 protesters in the Tibet Autonomous Region and surrounding Tibetan areas of China  Whereas Tibet is the center of Tibetan Buddhism and the Dalai Lama is the most revered figure in Tibetan Buddhism  Whereas  the Government of China continues to restrict the rights of Tibetan Buddhists to practice their religion freely  Whereas the Dalai Lama has condemned the violence that began on March 14  2008  and announced his continuing support for the Olympic Games to be held in Beijing  China  Whereas the Dalai Lama has specifically stated that he does not seek independence for Tibet from China and has called for negotiations to bring about meaningful autonomy for Tibet that allows Tibetans to maintain their distinctive identity within China  Whereas the Constitution of the People s Republic of China guarantees freedom of religious belief for all citizens  but the 2007 Annual Report on International Religious Freedom of the Department of State states that   d uring the period covered by this report  the Government  of China  s respect for freedom of religion remained poor   and Whereas  following the demonstrations that began on March 10  2008  the Government of China began severely restricting access to journalists and diplomats and creating a shortage of independent verification of the situation on the ground in Tibet  Now  therefore  be it Resolved  That the Senate    1  condemns the violence in Tibet and calls for restraint by the Government of the People s Republic of China and the people of Tibet   2  calls for a dialogue between the leadership of the Government of China and His Holiness the Dalai Lama on meaningful religious and cultural autonomy for Tibet within China and urges that these discussions take place with all deliberate speed   3  calls for the release of individuals who protested in a peaceful manner and for medical care for those injured and wounded in the violence that followed the protests   4  calls on the Government of China to cease its efforts to enter monasteries to  reeducate  monks and nuns  to respect the right of the people of Tibet to speak of the Dalai Lama and possess his photograph  and to respect and protect basic human rights  as provided in the Constitution of the People s Republic of China   5  calls on the Government of China to honor its commitment to allow international journalists free access to China from mid 2007 to October 17  2008   6  calls on the Government of China to provide a full accounting of the March 2008 protests in Tibet  the response of the Government of China  and the manner and number of detentions and deaths that occurred following the protests  and  7  both     A  calls on the United States Department of State to fully implement the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002  22 USC 6901 note   including the stipulation that the Secretary of State  seek to establish an office in Lhasa  Tibet to monitor political  economic  and cultural developments in Tibet   and also to provide consular protection and citizen services in emergencies  and  B  urges that the agreement to permit China to open further diplomatic missions in the United States should be contingent upon the

  Statement of Senator Barack Obama on Destruction of CIA Interrogation Tapes   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Statement of Senator Barack Obama on Destruction of CIA Interrogation Tapes Friday  December  7  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 The following statement was submitted by Senator Obama in the Congressional Record today  Mr  President  I wish to express my serious concern over the Central Intelligence Agency   s confirmation that videotapes depicting brutal interrogation techniques were destroyed   First  it is important that we note the broader context of this debate  The United States of America is a nation born out of a struggle against tyranny  and our founding legal document asserts that the rule of law applies to all men and women  and all branches and agencies of government  We are not a perfect nation  but our national greatness is marked by our ability to rise above our imperfections through our allegiance to our values and to the rule of law  Time and again  America has triumphed because of the contrast we draw to tyranny  We are a nation that set captives free  shut down torture chambers  and extended freedom and international law to more of humanity   Now  we are engaged in a new kind of conflict  And the question that we have faced since September 11  2001  is how we are going to respond to the shadowy  stateless  terrorist enemies of the 21st century   Tragically  the Bush Administration has too often chosen to respond to this enemy by abandoning our values and ignoring laws that it deems inconvenient  So we have seen excessive secrecy  indefinite detention  warrantless wire tapping  and    enhanced interrogation techniques    like simulated drowning that qualify as torture through any careful measure of the law or appeal to human decency  For each of these new policies  we have seen dubious legal reasoning that does not stand up to the harsh light of review or the sound judgment of our Constitution   Yesterday  we learned that in November 2005  the CIA destroyed videotapes of its interrogations of two prominent al Qaeda suspects  including a close Osama bin Laden associate     Abu Zubayadah  Media reports suggest that these videotapes depict brutal interrogation techniques  and could certainly be relevant to ongoing investigations and inquiries  Furthermore  these videotapes were not provided to the 9 11 Commission  which made a broad set of requests for classified documents     including interrogation tapes and transcripts     that would have included information about the 9 11 attacks   The CIA has argued that these tapes needed to be destroyed to protect the identities of the interrogators  Our government must go to any length necessary to protect the identities of those who serve in a covert capacity  But the CIA keeps scores of classified material     including videotapes     while protecting the identities of its agents  This raises serious questions about whether the tapes were destroyed to protect the nature of the interrogation  rather than the identity of the interrogator   Mr  President  this incident deserves further congressional oversight and inquiry     neither the CIA nor this interrogation program is immune to our laws  This is yet another chapter in a dark period in our constitutional history  Now  it is time to turn the page  That is why I was heartened to learn that the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have reached agreement on including a requirement in the Intelligence Authorization bill that subjects CIA interrogators to the guidelines on interrogation included in the U S  Army Field Manual  It would be a grave disappointment     though not surprising     if this important step forward were subject to a veto threat from the President  That must not deter the Congress from moving forward  We have a responsibility to act   We should not have a separate interrogation program whose methods are so abhorrent that they cannot stand up to scrutiny  We should not have to find ways of ignoring or averting our own laws to defend our country  Torture does not work  Torture violates our laws  And torture sets back the standing and moral leadership that America needs to triumph in this global struggle  Our values and laws are not inconvenient obstacles to the defense of our national security     they can and must be a guiding force in our response to terrorism  Mr  President  today is Pearl Harbor day     a date when our nation was subjected to a terrible surprise attack  and when a generation of Americans answered the call to defend our security and extend the cause of freedom  More than six years after 9 11  we are still struggling to define our own response to our generation   s terrible surprise attack  As we defend America  let us learn the painful lessons of these last few years  and enlist our values and our Constitution in this first great struggle of the 21st century   I thank the President and yield the floor

      Senators Obama and Bunning Introduce Legislation to Expand Coal Use Wednesday  June  7  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Tommy Vietor or Robert Gibbs   202  228 5511  Bunning Contact  Mike Reynard   202  224 1156  Date  June 7  2006   Senators Obama and Bunning Introduce Legislation to Expand Coal Use   WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senators Jim Bunning  R KY  and Barack Obama  D IL  today announced that they have introduced S 3325  the  Coal To Liquid Fuel Promotion Act of 2006    Joining this bipartisan legislation as original co sponsors are Senators Conrad Burns  R MT   Richard Lugar  R IN   Mark Pryor  D AR   and Lisa Murkowski  R AK    This comprehensive piece of legislation creates tax incentives for coal to liquids  CTL  technology and the construction of CTL plants   If passed  this legislation will help create the infrastructure needed to make CTL a viable energy resource throughout America    In the CTL process  coal is gasified  the gas is run through the Fischer Tropsch process  and the resulting fuel is refined into diesel  The final diesel product is cleaner than conventional diesel because most of the sulfur and nitrogen is removed during the Fischer Tropsch process  Currently  all the vehicles in South Africa run on fuels produced by Fischer Tropsch     Bunning said   The bipartisan legislation I introduced with Senator Obama will help create the infrastructure needed to get coal to liquids technology off the ground   CTL technology offers America the chance to capitalize on an abundant domestic resource that is found in eastern and western Kentucky  With a heavy investment into CTL  America will wean itself off of foreign sources of energy  and at the same time create jobs for working families back home   CTL is a viable  environmentally friendly energy resource  and will help cure America s addiction to oil    Obama said   The people I meet in town hall meetings back home would rather fill their cars with fuel made from coal reserves in Southern Illinois than with fuel made from crude reserves in Saudi Arabia  We already have the technology to do this in a way that s both clean and efficient  What we ve been lacking is the political will  This common sense  bipartisan legislation will greatly increase investment in coal to liquid fuel technology  which will create jobs and lessen our dependence on foreign oil  Illinois Basin Coal has more untapped energy potential than the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait combined  Instead of enriching the Saudis  we can use these reserves to bring a renaissance for Illinois coal     The Coal to Liquid Fuel Promotion Act of 2006 is a three part  comprehensive effort to create a vibrant domestic CTL fuel market  First  this bill enables the Department of Energy to provide loan guarantees for construction and loans for the necessary planning of CTL plants   Loan guarantees will encourage private investment and planning loans will help companies prepare a plant for construction  Second  this legislation will expand investment tax credits and expensing provisions to include coal to liquids plants and extend the Fuel Excise Tax credit  These tax incentives build on the loans and loan guarantees by offering tax breaks during the multiple year construction phase and during initial production at the plant  Third  this bill provides the Department of Defense the funding to purchase  test  and integrate these fuels into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve                                                                                                                                                                      Coal to Liquid Fuel Promotion Act of 2006   On April 24th  Senator Jim Bunning  R KY  chaired an Energy Committee hearing on coal to liquids fuels   The committee heard testimony from the Department of Energy on the implementation of provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the committee discussed what additional authorizations may be needed   Bunning spoke with the Southern States Energy Board  individual companies engaging CTL technology  the National Mining Association  leading scientists including researchers at the University of Kentucky  and members of the environmental community   As a result of these discussions  Senators Bunning and Obama have composed a comprehensive piece of legislation that will create a backbone of CTL infrastructure in the United States   1  DOE Facilitation of Construction Loan Guarantees   Authorizes DOE to administer loan guarantees for the first CTL plants   These plants must have a minimum production of 10 000 barrels a day and the loan guarantee program would expire once ten large scale plants are built or commercial production reaches 100 000 barrels of CTL fuel daily  Planning Loans   Provides DOE authority to issue matching loans to groups engaging permitting and planning of a large scale CTL plant   The loans are capped at  20 million  must be matched dollar for dollar by non Federal money  and must be repaid after the plant is financed  within 5 years   Expanded Plant Siting   Authorizes DOE  DOD  and other agencies to promulgate regulations to allow BRAC sites  military bases and DOE current and former facilities to be considered as sites for commercial CTL plants   2  Tax Incentives for Investment and Production Investment Tax Credit and Expensing   Expands 20  tax credit for CTL plants  including the infrastructure needed to capture  transport and sequester carbon  capped at  200 million a plant and limited to 10 plants  Provides a similar provision for expensing these investments  but does not allow double dipping  Fuel Excise Tax Extension for CTL   Extends the fuel tax credit for CTL products from 2009  From SAFETEA LU  until January 1  2020   3  National Security and Defense Strategic Petroleum Reserve   Requires a DOD report on CTL fuel storage and inclusion in the SPR  authorizes the construction of SPR storage facilities for CTL fuel to be located outside of the Gulf States and authorizes that the SPR to hold up to 20  of the reserve in the form of CTL finished fuels   DOD Research and Development   Authorizes funding for the Air Force CTL R and testing program  DOD Multi year contracting   Authorizes DOD contract authority for up to 25 years

the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities at the National Institutes of Health and strengthens its role in coordinating and planning minority health and health disparity research   Studies have shown that minority health professionals are more likely to care for patients from minority and disadvantaged backgrounds and to provide culturally sensitive care  so creating a diverse healthcare workforce is essential for a health America  The bill would help achieve that goal by reauthorizing the programs that help schools recruit and retain minority students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds like the Title VII health workforce diversity  Centers of Excellence and Health Careers Opportunity programs   The bill also reauthorizes and strengthens the Office of Minority Health  mandates uniform data collection standards for federal health programs and creates an advisory committee at the FDA to address genomic issues related to racial and ethnic minorities

               Obama Initiative Would Greatly Increase Risk Based Homeland Security Funding Tuesday  March  6  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE         Contact  Ben LaBolt 202 228 5511 Roemer says amendment would allow the    full spirit    of the 9 11 Commission   s recommendations to be realized  WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama today sponsored an initiative recommended by the 9 11 Commission that would increase the amount of homeland security funding that is allocated based on risk  instead of shared equally between states   The 9 11 Commission Report states             Federal homeland security assistance should not remain a program for general revenue sharing   It should supplement state and local resources based on the risks or vulnerabilities that merit additional support     p  396        Five long years after 9 11  homeland security funding is still being treated as a pork barrel     said Senator Obama      States that face the greatest threats should receive the most funding  to secure their infrastructure and prepare their first responders   A flea market on a roadside and a metropolitan transit system do not carry the same risks  and they should not be treated equally   To honor the victims and to arm ourselves to prevent another attack  states must demonstrate risks and vulnerabilities to receive significant funding      The Obama amendment to the homeland security bill would decrease the current minimum funding each state receives under the State Homeland Security Grant program to  25 percent  with an increase to  45 percent for border states     a proposal consistent with the House version of the bill   S  4 currently proposes that all states receive a minimum of  45 percent of the state homeland security grants   Currently  the state minimum is  75 percent  consuming approximately 40 percent of the program   s funds   Former 9 11 Commissioners Lee Hamilton and Tim Roemer wrote letters in support of Senator Obama   s amendment   Referring to the Commission   s Report Card on progress since 9 11  Roemer said     On homeland security  the government received an F because too many of our vulnerabilities received too few resources   We cannot afford to waste any more money  time  or effort       I commend these efforts to move the Senate in a better direction and believe this amendment creates the opportunity for the full spirit of the 9 11 Commission   s recommendations to be realized in conference with the House      Hamilton wrote      Resources for homeland security are not unlimited  so it is thus essential that they be distributed based upon a careful analysis of the risk  vulnerability  and potential consequences of a terrorist attack   Adopting such a risk based approach would make the best use of our homeland security resources  and would make the American people safer      The full text of Senator Obama   s floor remarks on the amendment is below   It was a typical fall day in New York City   People were headed to work   Cars were stuck in traffic   The subways were packed   And construction crews were busy rebuilding at Ground Zero   Nearby  Con Ed personnel were at work in a manhole and they made a tragic discovery  ID tags and human remains not seen since that other fall day five years earlier   The City paused again   It launched another effort to recover and identify those taken from us on that dark September day   The recovery continues after all this time   The recovery continues five and a half years later  and just last week more victims were unearthed   After all this time  we are still recovering from September 11   Our prayers remain with the family members and friends who still mourn and miss the fathers and mothers and children who made their lives complete   This is why we are here   We are here to do the work that ensures that no other family member has to lose a loved one to a terrorist who turns a plane into a missile  a terrorist who straps a bomb around her waist and climbs aboard a bus  a terrorist who figures out how to set off a dirty bomb in one of our cities   This is why we are here  to make our country safer and make sure that the nearly 3 000 lives that were taken from us did not die in vain   Their legacy will be a safer and more secure nation   That is what lies at the heart of this 9 11 bill  It   s not just about how we send the money from Washington to the states and local governments   It is about saving lives and doing everything in our power to prevent another attack   to prevent another tragedy   to ensure that no one climbs down a manhole  expecting to do their work  only to find the deceased left in darkness five years earlier   That is why we are here  to protect our people   Now  most of us had hoped that these steps would have been taken many years ago   That we would have capitalized on the unity and the national spirit we shared after the Towers fell  the Pentagon was hit  and the Pennsylvania field smoldered   Well  it is never too late to do what is right for our country   It has been more than two and a half years since the 9 11 Commission issued its report   Not only did the panel of dedicated Americans research what happened that day  but they also gave a list of serious recommendations about how to make our country safer in the future   The 9 11 Commission showed us how to move beyond the politics of division in order to achieve the solemn task of better protecting our country   In its report  the Commission said the following    quote     Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities  and  federal homeland security assistance should not remain a program for general revenue sharing      end of quote    This is one of the goals of the 9 11 Commission   My amendment moves us closer to a true system of risk based allocation of state homeland security grants and ensures that funding goes to areas most at risk of terrorist attacks   This isn   t an issue of big states versus little states or urban states versus rural states   It   s about good policy and about maximizing our use of the people   s money   Today  the system is set up so that all states receive at least 0 75 percent of the State Homeland Security Grant program dollars   After each state receives that minimum level of funding  the dollars are then allocated according to risk   As a result  the current amount of state minimum funding eats up approximately 40 percent of that funding    While the new bill does attempt to address this problem and I applaud Chairman Lieberman and Senator Collins for trying to bring the 0 75 percent down to 0 45 percent  the bill doesn   t go far enough   It is a good first step  but we   re already 50 yards behind  sending too much money to areas where there aren   t real risks  threats  and vulnerabilities    That is why we must use the most dollars in those areas that are at the greatest risk of an attack   We can   t afford to waste a single cent on places that don   t need immediate help when first responders in major cities still lack the basic communications equipment they need to talk to one another if heaven forbid tragedy strikes again   That is why the Families of 9 11 recently issued a statement  saying    quote     Reports of air conditioned garbage trucks being purchased with homeland security funds are indicative of the frivolity that results from non risk based allocation methods   When the threat against our nation is so real  we cannot afford not to take it seriously      end of quote   That is why the 9 11 Commission said that Congress shouldn   t use this money as pork barrel    That is why in 2005  the Commission issued a report card  giving the nation an    F    for risk based funding   That is why 9 11 Commission chairman Lee Hamilton recently sent me a letter   He wrote    quote     Since 9 11  and since the issuance of our report  the United States has not allocated homeland security resources wisely   Resources for homeland security are not unlimited  so it is thus essential that they be distributed based upon a careful analysis of the risk  vulnerability  and potential consequences of a terrorist attack  Adopting such a risk based approach would make the best use of our homeland security resources  and would make the American people safer      end of quote   That is why 9 11 Commissioner Tim Roemer wrote in support of this amendment  saying   quote     We cannot afford to waste any more money  time or effort      end of quote   And that is why the amendment I offer today     a bi partisan amendment with the support of Senators Warner  Coburn  Landrieu  Kennedy  Menendez  Clinton and Schumer     reduces the guaranteed state minimum to 0 25 percent and allow those states on our northern and southern borders to see an increased minimum of 0 45 percent   This basic framework was adopted by a wide bipartisan margin in the House in January   It is time for all of us to approach homeland security funding not as something we can bring home to the states we represent  but funding we can use to better protect the United States of America   As we lower the guaranteed amount  we increase the funding available to protect those places most at risk   And 40 states will receive either the same amount or an increase in the funding they need to better protect our borders  our ports  our railroads  our subways  our chemical plants  our nuclear power plants  our food supply and our fire fighters  police officers and EMT   s   We have waited more than five years to better develop our approach to funding our security in a post 9 11 world   Sometimes division and politics have prevented us from doing what we need to do   But I believe that those days are finally behind us   We have a real chance to not only learn from our mistakes  but to get the job done and better protect our people   That is why we are here  to make our country as safe and secure as we can   That is the common cause we all share   The American people need to see that in us   The 9 11 Commission expects that from us   And the victims    families and friends are owed that from us   We will never forget those who died    We will never forget those who are suffering and sick because of their heroism that day   We will never forget that 60 percent of the victims were never identified   We will never forget that we are still recovering from 9 11   And that is why our work goes on                                    ,Obama

  Obama  McCaskill Introduce Bill to Evaluate Needs of Returning Service Members   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  McCaskill Introduce Bill to Evaluate Needs of Returning Service Members Wednesday  May  2  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt  Would ensure physical and mental health conditions  readjustment priorities are addressed WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Claire McCaskill  D MO  today introduced the Homecoming Enhancement Research and Oversight  HERO  Act  legislation that would launch a comprehensive research endeavor to evaluate the physical  mental health  and readjustment needs of service members returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan   Between family commitments  widespread traumatic brain injuries and mental health disorders  and multiple redeployments  today   s service members and their families face a unique set of needs that must be identified and addressed      Caring for our returning service members is one thing we can still get right about this war     said Senator Obama      We must ensure that we give our service members  veterans and their families receive the treatment  care  and assistance they need to rebuild their lives   The challenges do not diminish for many service members when they return home because the legacy of war takes a physical and emotional toll   As we bring this war to a resolution  it   s our duty to honor the commitment of these heroes by meeting their long term needs          Those who have fought this war and felt its effects most personally  our servicemen and women  deserve to have a real researched plan for dealing with the aftermath of their sacrifice  so that the mistakes made by the administration in war planning are not repeated in planning for the readjustment needs of these heroes     Senator McCaskill said      Such a comprehensive research effort proved invaluable for Vietnam veterans but came ten years late  We need to deliver the same level of analysis and planning for today   s veterans right now     After many Vietnam veterans had difficulty readjusting when they returned from war  a national Vietnam veterans study was conducted to evaluate their needs  but it was completed more than a decade after the war ended   This war has been described as a    family war      According to the American Psychological Association  60  of deployed service members have family responsibilities  and at any given time  some 500 000 children have at least one parent deployed   There is a lack of research focused on mental health and other readjustment needs of returning service members  including service connected PTSD and increasingly complex Traumatic Brain Injuries  The Hero Act would direct the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to launch a national research study which would achieve the following in two phases  Phase One Research  completed in 180 days  Preliminary findings on the mental health and adjustment needs as well as gaps in care facing service members  veterans and their families   Description of research tracks and parameters for Phase Two research  Phase Two Research  completed in 3 years   An assessment of the psychological  social and economic impacts of deployments on service members  veterans and their families  including the particular impacts of multiple extended deployments and the long term effects of untreated physical and mental health disorders  such as PTSD    An assessment of the particular needs and concerns of female members of the Armed Forces and female veterans An assessment of the particular needs and concerns of minority members of the Armed Forces and minority veterans   An assessment of the particular educational and vocational needs of returning service members  veterans and their families   An assessment of the full scope of the effects of TBIs on service members and former members  including effects on the family members and caregivers  and efficacy and accessibility of current treatment options within the DOD and VA   Recommendations  based on Phase Two findings  of remedies or strategies to prevent  minimize or address the impacts  needs and gaps in care identified  Follow Up Action Planning  The VA and DOD must submit joint planning documents  with cost estimates  which respond to the NAS findings  and the GAO will audit these documents  The Hero Act has been endorsed by Veterans for America  Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America  Coalition to Salute America   s Heroes and the Brain Injury Association of America  Senators Obama and McCaskill also sponsored the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act  which takes a comprehensive approach to improving treatment for returning service members  from improving facilities  to increasing caseworkers and counselors and easing the transition from the DoD to the VA   Senator Obama is also the sponsor of the Lane Evans Veterans Health and Benefits Improvement Act  which would make veterans who served on active duty during a period of war eligible for a mental health evaluation and provide hospital care  medical services  nursing home care  and family and marital counseling for any identified mental health

  Obama Statement on Veterans    Affairs Committee Hearing on Marion VA Hospital   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama Statement on Veterans    Affairs Committee Hearing on Marion VA Hospital Tuesday  November  6  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  Contact  Amy Brundage  202 615 9467 WASHINGTON  DC    Today  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  submitted the following statement for the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee hearing on  Hiring Practices and Quality Control in VA Medical Facilities   He specifically addressed the issue at the Marion  Illinois VA Medical Center  which saw an increased number of patient deaths over the last months and was found to have employed a surgeon who had been barred from practicing in another state  Obama  along with Senator Dick Durbin  has repeatedly pressed the VA for information on the situation in Marion  The senators sent a letter to Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs Gordon Mansfield asking additional questions that were raised by the VA   s response  in regard to the unexpected deaths  other patient safety events and the credentialing process for VA doctors   Previously  the senators wrote outgoing Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson asking specific questions about the VA s response to the increase in deaths at the center   They also asked why Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez  who had been barred from practicing in another state  continued to practice at the Marion VA Center until August  and asked about the background check performed before he was hired   This followed a previous letter to Secretary Nicholson  sent by Durbin and Obama  asking for more information on the ongoing investigation   Obama has also joined Durbin in calling on the U S  Attorney s office to investigate allegations of criminal wrongdoing at the Marion VA   Below is Senator Obama s statement to the Committee  which is submitted for the hearing record   Senator Durbin and I have worked to get to the bottom of what went wrong at the Marion facility     and many questions still remain   We will keep fighting for answers  not only for our veterans and those families who have lost a loved one  but for all who have been affected by this loss   That is part of keeping our sacred trust to these true American heroes     While some may argue that the problems at Marion were isolated  I have serious concerns that medical errors  including fatal errors  may have occurred because of more systemic failings in the VA s quality safeguards   GAO testimony about weak internal controls over privileging and physicians practicing with expired privileges in at least one VA facility strongly suggest that this problem may be more widespread   We have asked important questions about the VA s medical credentialing and privileging process  and I hope that Dr  Cross  the Principal Deputy Under Secretary for Health  can provide evidence today as to whether the VA views its current process as adequate   If not  he owes us answers about what he is doing today to improve the process   We also need to address the VA s quality measurement tracking system   The data analysis that flagged the spike in unexpected deaths at the Marion facility     which was part of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program  NSQIP      triggered action almost six months after the period in which that death rate was observed    When we are talking about the quality of care and safety of our veterans  we cannot wait six months to be alerted to and start investigating a tragedy like this one   We must have safeguards that would flag any problems much more quickly and accurately    Furthermore  we still have not yet been able to confirm how many of the deaths from April     September 2007 were unexpected at the Marion VA  and I urge Dr  Cross to provide that answer today   This is an important question because doctors who have since been dismissed were still authorized to operate during this time period   Last week  allegations of serious misconduct and possible criminal wrongdoing were presented to my office by a group of current and former VA employees   These allegations must be thoroughly investigated  not only by the Office of the Inspector General  but by the U S  Attorney s Office   If true  they reinforce the failure in oversight from the VA Health Administration of facilities across the country   When VA employees seek to report a medical error or a problem with the management  they must have protected avenues to do so   The majority of VA health staff perform their jobs with exceptional competence and compassion on a daily basis   They do not have an easy job   And they are the first to agree that our veterans deserve world class medical care   So today  the VA must show us how they will put air tight quality controls in place to anticipate and catch problems before they turn into tragedies                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election      ,Obama

Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  September 26  2005 Obama Asks ConocoPhillips to Delay 45 Day Shutdown of Wood River Refinery to Prevent Gas Price Increase   WASHINGTON   In a letter to ConocoPhillips CEO James Mulva  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today requested that ConocoPhillips delay a scheduled 45 day maintenance shutdown of the Wood River Refinery in Roxana  Illinois to ensure that a decrease in fuel supply doesn t exacerbate already high gas prices    This shutdown could exacerbate the problems with reduced refining capacity caused by recent Hurricanes Katrina and Rita   said Obama   Although initial indications are that Hurricane Rita did not cause significant additional damage to Gulf Coast refineries  many refineries were shut down prior to the hurricane  and it is expected to take one to two weeks before these plants can begin processing again     On September 2  2005  the Alton Telegraph reported that the Wood River Refinery had been planning to shut down for 45 days in mid September for maintenance  This refinery is the tenth largest in the country and processes 306 000 barrels of crude oil per day  sending gasoline all over the Midwest  Obama said that shutting down this facility when U S  refining capacity is already diminished could increase already high gasoline and diesel fuel prices    In light of the uncertain situation in the Gulf Coast  I urge ConocoPhillips to consider delaying the shutdown of this refinery  unless the shutdown is absolutely necessary for safety reasons   said Obama   President Bush recently urged U S  refiners to postpone all scheduled maintenance for four to six weeks  I hope ConocoPhillips will heed the President s suggestion as long as any postponement does not compromise safety      Obama requested that ConocoPhillips notify him by September 29  2005  as to whether the facility will delay its scheduled maintenance    September 26  2005   James Mulva  CEO   ConocoPhillips  600 North Dairy Ashford  77079 1175   P O  Box 2197  Houston  TX 77252 2197    Dear Mr  Mulva    I am writing to express my serious concerns about the planned shutdown of the ConocoPhillips Wood River Refinery and its implications for gasoline supply at a time of record high prices    According to a September 2  2005  story in the Alton Telegraph  the Wood River Refinery had been planning to shut down for 45 days in mid September for maintenance   My staff has since learned that this shutdown date has been moved to September 29   This refinery  which is the tenth largest in the country  processes 306 000 barrels of crude oil per day and sends gasoline all over the Midwest    I understand that refineries are required to shut down once or twice a year for maintenance  often in September or October   Although the shutdown of the Wood River facility apparently has been planned for a while  this shutdown could exacerbate the problems with reduced refining capacity caused by Hurricane Katrina   Although initial indications are that Hurricane Rita did not cause significant additional damage to Gulf Coast refineries  many refineries were shut down prior to the hurricane  and it is expected to take one to two weeks before these plants can begin processing again    Numerous constituents have expressed their concern that the shutdown of the Wood River Refinery could cause gas prices to go even higher at a time when gas prices are already causing significant hardships for average Americans  In a few months  the price of home heating oil and natural gas will likely reach new heights as well      In light of the uncertain situation in the Gulf Coast  I urge ConocoPhillips to consider delaying the shutdown of this refinery  unless the shutdown is absolutely necessary for safety reasons   Indeed  President Bush recently urged U S  refiners to postpone all scheduled maintenance for four to six weeks   I hope ConocoPhillips will heed the President s suggestion as long as any postponement does not compromise safety      I request that you notify me by September 29  2005  as to whether the Wood River maintenance will be delayed and if so  by how many weeks   If ConocoPhillips is determined to go forward with the maintenance  I request that you provide me with an explanation for this decision    Thank you for your prompt attention to this request    Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator                                  ,Obama

             Obama Calls on U S  to Stockpile Avian Flu Drugs to Guard Against Pandemic Tuesday  August  9  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  August 9  2005   Obama Calls on U S  to Stockpile Avian Flu Drugs to Guard Against Pandemic   WASHINGTON   In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Michael O  Leavitt  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today asked the Bush administration to immediately begin creating a stockpile of avian flu vaccines and antivirals sufficient to protect 25 percent of the U S  population    It has been estimated that with no vaccine or antiviral drugs  93 million Americans would be infected with avian flu  and 164 000 would die   said Obama   However  if an effective vaccine is provided to 80 percent of individuals younger than 19 years of age  the estimated numbers decrease to 6 million total cases and 15 000 total deaths  A sufficient supply of antivirals could have the same protective effect     Recent news reports indicate that the avian flu vaccine by Sanofi Pasteur may be effective in preventing the disease  However  the vaccine was only proven to be effective when administered at a high dose  which means that the 2 million vaccines doses already acquired by the government would protect only about 450 000 Americans  Similarly  the current supply of the antiviral used to prevent and treat avian flu is grossly inadequate    The World Health Organization recommends that countries maintain a stockpile of antivirals capable of treating 25  of their population   said Obama   However  between the U S  government s current stockpile and its plan to order additional doses  there are only enough treatments for 2  of the U S  population  Roche  which manufactures the drug  has stated that it could supply 13 million more courses of treatment in 2006 and an additional 70 million in 2007  if ordered by the U S  government     We must accelerate efforts to produce an effective vaccine against avian flu and stockpile enough doses of vaccines and antivirals to prevent and treat avian flu     Full text of the letter below      August 9  2005    The Honorable Michael O  Leavitt  Secretary of Health and Human Services  U S  Department of Health and Human Services  Washington  DC  20510   Dear Secretary Leavitt    I am writing to urge the Bush Administration to take immediate action to prepare for and respond to a potential avian flu pandemic     Such a pandemic is becoming increasingly more likely given bird to human transmission of avian flu and the persistent and growing numbers of infected chickens and other birds around the world   The only remaining requirement for pandemic avian flu is efficient human to human transmission  and there is some concern that this may soon occur   Given the high mortality rate from avian flu among those who have contracted the virus thus far  the world would experience human suffering and death of cataclysmic proportions if immediate steps are not taken to prevent and mitigate its impact    Unlike previous pandemics  these early warnings about a potential avian flu pandemic have provided the United States with a small window of opportunity to prepare for this eventuality   In particular  we must accelerate efforts to produce an effective vaccine against avian flu and stockpile enough doses of antivirals to prevent and treat avian flu   It has been estimated that with no vaccine or antiviral drugs  93 million Americans would be infected with avian flu  and 164 000 would die   However  if an effective vaccine is provided to 80 percent of individuals younger than 19 years of age  the estimated numbers decrease to 6 million total cases and 15 000 total deaths   A sufficient supply of antivirals could have the same protective effect    I was encouraged by this week s announcement that the latest clinical trials of the Sanofi Pasteur vaccine against avian flu were successful   However  the vaccine was only effective when given in high doses  which means that the 2 million vaccine doses already acquired by the government would protect only about 450 000 Americans   I understand from news accounts yesterday that the U S  government is preparing to purchase additional doses from Sanofi            Similarly  the current supply of the antiviral oseltamavir is grossly inadequate to protect or treat the U S  population  let alone to assist efforts by our international partners    The World Health Organization recommends that countries maintain a stockpile of antivirals capable of treating 25  of their population   However  between the U S  government s current stockpile and its plan to order additional doses  there are only enough treatments for 2  of the U S  population   Roche  which manufactures the drug  has stated that it could supply 13 million more courses of treatment in 2006 and an additional 70 million in 2007  if ordered by the U S  government     But  vaccines and antivirals are not enough   More needs to be done to strengthen and expand our nation s public health infrastructure   Public health providers will play a pivotal role in training doctors and other health practitioners  delivering preventive and medical care  communicating with the public  and conducting continuous surveillance     Since any avian flu pandemic would likely begin abroad  the U S  should be working with international health organizations on assisting poor countries to purchase vaccines and antivirals and to develop a system for quickly distributing the drugs in the event of a pandemic    Over the past six months  I have pushed for   and the Senate has appropriated    35 million to assist in the fight against the avian flu   The Foreign Affairs Authorization Act  S  600   which could pass the Senate this fall  would require the establishment of an interagency task force to design and implement a comprehensive  international strategy to prevent and respond to an outbreak of the avian flu   I also have introduced the AVIAN Act  S  969  which would improve domestic and international preparedness against a potential pandemic  including procuring vaccines and antivirals for a strategic national stockpile and studying the creation of an international fund to support pandemic control     To improve this country s preparedness for a potential avian flu pandemic  I urge the Administration to take a number of steps immediately    The U S  government should begin creating a national stockpile with sufficient doses of antivirals to protect 25  of the U S  population   If subsequent studies confirm the effectiveness of an avian flu vaccine  the U S  government should begin creating a national stockpile with sufficient vaccine doses to protect 25  of the U S  population   The U S  government should finalize its domestic preparedness plan to prevent and respond to an outbreak of the avian flu   The U S  government should establish an interagency task force to design and implement a comprehensive  international strategy to prevent and respond to an outbreak of the avian flu  and  The U S  government should work with international health organizations to assist other countries in purchasing necessary vaccines and antivirals     Please notify me by August 23  2005  as to what  if any  steps the Administration is taking in these areas   Thank you    Sincerely  Barack Obama              United States Senator                                   ,Obama

Make College More Affordable Friday  September  7  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5566 Obama efforts cut student loans  increase Pell Grants in Higher Ed Bill  WASHINGTON  D C      Today  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  made the following statement on The College Cost Reduction and Access Act  which passed the Senate this morning  The bill included a provision to increase Pell Grants for eligible students by  500 next year  and to  5 400 by 2012  The bill also mandates that interest rates on subsidized student loans are cut in half over four years  Senator Obama sat on the Conference Committee that won these improvements in the bill  Below is a statement by Senator Obama   The first bill I introduced as a Senator was to make college more affordable for every American  and the bill we passed today is an important step toward achieving that goal     Senator Obama said      In a global economy where countries who out educate us will out compete us tomorrow  we must make a college education available and affordable for every American  and that means doing more to invest in programs that work and expanding them to more students   We must also end wasteful  high priced loans from private lenders and use the savings to help more students go to college   By investing in education we are restoring America s competitiveness in the world  and today is an important step forward  I want to thank Senator Kennedy for his continued leadership on this issue    As a member of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  Obama also worked to secure an increase of  100 million in college aid for Illinois students in 2008 2009  and a projected  850 million over the next several years  This increased student aid is mostly in the form of Pell Grants  This is paid for not by increasing the deficit  but by reductions in government subsidies to banks and other lenders  This is similar to the provisions of the HOPE Act  the first bill Senator Obama introduced in the Senate in 2005  THE COLLEGE COST REDUCTION AND ACCESS ACT  The College Cost Reduction and Access Act Will Provide Over  20 Billion in New Student Aid and Benefits     The Largest Increase in Funding Since the GI Bill  According to a recent report on education statistics  twenty years ago  the maximum Pell Grant covered 51 percent of the cost of tuition  fees  room and board at a public four year college  In the 2005 2006 school year  the maximum Pell Grant covered roughly a third of these costs  Democrats have worked to rectify this decline in the purchasing power of the Pell Grant  Under the College Cost Reduction and Access Act  the maximum Pell Grant will be increased by  500 next year to  4800 and to  5 400 by 2012   Analysis of Department of Education

  Obama Statement on Efforts to Assist Former Blockson Chemical Plant Workers   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama Statement on Efforts to Assist Former Blockson Chemical Plant Workers Tuesday  April  8  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT   Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today released the following update on his efforts to ensure that the workers from the former Blockson Chemical plant in Braidwood  Illinois are informed about claims they have filed with the U S  Department of Labor under the federal Energy Employees Occupational Illness and Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA   The Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  ABRWH   which by law reports to the Secretary of Health and Human Services  and is appointed by the President  is holding a meeting April 7 9 in Tampa  Florida   While the Advisory Board will discuss issues related to several former nuclear weapons sites around the country  one of the items on their agenda is the Blockson Chemical Special Exposure Cohort  SEC  petition     After these Blockson Chemical plant workers and their families have already suffered through so much  we owe it them make sure the government takes a second look at all of the claims that were denied   said Senator Obama    I call on the Advisory Board to approve the petition  and ensure that everyone is compensated   But  if the petition is not granted  I am pleased to know these denied claims will at least be reopened and recalculated    I am committed to these Illinoisans  claims  and will do everything I can to keep their chances of compensation alive    The EEOICPA  which was enacted in 2000  is designed to provide compensation to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who worked on the U S  government s nuclear weapons development program during the Cold War   Many of these workers were often exposed to harmful radiation  without their knowledge  and now suffer from cancer and other debilitating illnesses   The U S  Department of Labor administers the EEOICPA program  while the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH   a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  administers the dose reconstruction aspect of the program   The EEOICPA law provides two ways for workers or their survivors to be compensated  individually or as part of a larger group   For individuals  through a process called  dose reconstruction   NIOSH estimates the exposure workers were subjected to using mathematical models based on available data  such as contracts  purchase orders  safety monitoring records and worker medical records   However  if workers believe the government cannot accurately perform the dose reconstructions  a petitioner can file a Special Exposure Cohort  SEC  petition on behalf of a group of workers   This petition is filed with NIOSH   Once NIOSH completes an evaluation of a petition  NIOSH presents its report to the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  ABRWH    If the Advisory Board  which currently has twelve members  determines that the government cannot accurately complete dose reconstructions  then by majority vote the Board will send a report with its recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services   If the Advisory Board sides with the government s argument that dose reconstructions can be performed with sufficient accuracy  the Board will vote to recommend denial of the SEC petition   On its own initiative  NIOSH can advise  and in the past has advised  the Advisory Board that it could not perform dose reconstructions and thus has recommended that a class of claimants be compensated via an SEC   The Secretary of Health and Human Services makes the ultimate determination as to whether a petition should be approved or denied  In the case of Blockson Chemical  an SEC petition has been submitted   The Advisory Board met in 2006 in Naperville  IL  where Senator Obama addressed the Board and advocated on behalf of workers at several Illinois nuclear weapons sites  including Blockson Chemical   At that time  Senator Obama pressed the government to hold worker outreach meetings with Blockson workers to hear first hand accounts of what transpired at Blockson  to seek the counsel of an outside auditor as to the accuracy of the dose reconstructions being performed on Blockson claims  and to delay voting by the Advisory Board until the Board s independent auditor could perform a full review    NIOSH has contended that there is sufficient information to conduct a dose reconstruction by calculating the radiation that the Blockson employees were exposed to based on radiation that workers at an unrelated factory were exposed to and on urinalysis data from some  but not all  Blockson workers   I confess I m not a radiation expert   There are some around this table who are   But it does strike me that this is a somewhat suspect way at arriving at whether Blockson workers were sufficiently exposed to deserve compensation   It also seems to me to be contrary to the intent of the original legislation governing this compensation program  and I d strongly urge the Board to review this policy   I m also concerned that no official worker outreach meeting was conducted with the Blockson workers   Seems to me that if you re going to do a dose reconstruction  you d want to talk to all the workers  find out what evidence they have  and give them all a chance to comment on the procedure you re going to follow   So as a consequence I would urge the Board to postpone its decision regarding the Blockson SEC petition until after the Board s independent auditor has had a chance to review NIOSH s arguments    Comments delivered by Senator Obama to the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  December 12  2006  Naperville  IL  All of Senator Obama s requests were agreed to by the Board and NIOSH  At present  the Blockson claimant who filed the SEC petition has defined the SEC class as  All Atomic Weapons Employers employees  contractors and subcontractors  who worked in Building 55 at the Blockson Chemical Company  also known as Olin Mathieson  from January 1  1951 to December 31  1962    However  after discussions between NIOSH and the Department of Labor  the following class definition was offered and used by NIOSH in its evaluation   All Atomic Weapons Employers personnel who worked on activities related to the production of uranium at Blockson Chemical Company  Joliet  IL from January 1  1951 to December 31  1962   In terms of compensation  whether it is through the individual dose reconstruction process or via an SEC petition  workers who are approved for payment receive  150 000 plus medical benefits   It is important to stress that the Secretary of Health and Human Services decides who will  or will not  be in any class which receives compensation  although the Advisory Board s recommendation is an important part of his decision   With respect to the SEC petition  the Advisory Board has several options   It can   1  approve the petition according to the petitioner s definition  2  approve the petition according to the governments proposed definition  3  approve the petition with a new definition  drafted by the Board  4  deny the petition in its entirety  or 5  delay voting on the petition to a subsequent meeting   Following next week s meeting in Tampa  the next Advisory Board meeting will be held in June in St  Louis   The date and location are undetermined   To date  based on radiation dose reconstructions completed by NIOSH  the Department of Labor has approved 20 Blockson claims for payment and 91 claims have been denied  However  at Senator Obama s request  in late 2006 the Advisory Board sought and received a review by the Advisory Board s independent auditor  Sanford Cohen   Associates  as to the technical approach used by NIOSH to calculate Blockson dose reconstructions   After a thorough review  Sanford Cohen   Associates recommended seven changes to the dose reconstruction process   As a result  if the Advisory Board does not approve the Blockson SEC  NIOSH will automatically re calculate the 91 dose reconstructions previously denied in order to include these new recommendations   Any claimant who has already received compensation would not have his or her dose reconstruction re calculated and the compensation decision would stand   Senator Obama s staffer  who handles nuclear weapons worker compensation issues  will be in Tampa  Florida to monitor the Board s deliberations and speak on the workers  behalf                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election      ,Obama

Senator Barack Obama today made the following statement on the ambassadorial nominees before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee   Earlier today  Senator Obama chaired the nominations hearing of  The Honorable Barbara McConnell Barrett to be Ambassador to the Republic of Finland The Honorable Yousif Boutrous Ghafari to be Ambassador to the Republic of Slovenia Mr  Frank Urbancic  Jr  to be Ambassador to the Republic of Cyprus Ms  Nancy E  McEldowney to be Ambassador to the Republic of Bulgaria Mr  Kurt D  Volker to be U S  Permanent Representative on the Council of NATO Prepared remarks provided below  Today  the Committee meets to consider the nomination of five important diplomatic positions   The President has nominated Barbara McConnell Barrett to be Ambassador to the Republic of Finland  Yousif Boutrous Ghafari to be Ambassador to the Republic of Slovenia  Frank Urbancic  Jr  to be Ambassador to the Republic of Cyprus  Nancy McEldowney to be Ambassador to the Republic of Bulgaria  and Kurt Volker to be the U S  Permanent Representative on the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization    I am very pleased to welcome each of our nominees today   Without exception  you bring an impressive range of talents and experience to your assignments    I look forward to discussing the challenges you are likely to encounter and how you intend to strengthen our nation and its allies in the course of your service  Your nominations come at a critical moment in the history of American diplomacy   The challenges we face are formidable  securing our country  revitalizing our alliances  bolstering young democracies  and confronting the common threats of the 21st century   terrorism and nuclear weapons  climate change and poverty  genocide and disease   Turning these challenges into opportunities will require renewed American leadership   It will also require ambassadors who exemplify the principles that make our nation great    Upon confirmation  each of you will work with countries that are close partners of the United States and share our common faith in the value of self determination  accountable governments  collective security  and human rights   Mr  Volker  if confirmed  will serve as the United States  permanent representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization   NATO is the most powerful and most successful military alliance in the history of the world   No organization has done more to promote peace and security in Europe  or to create the protective shield that has allowed the democracies of the North Atlantic to grow into a free and prosperous community    But  as we saw at last week s summit in Bucharest  NATO is not as strong  as capable  or as united as it should be   Afghanistan  NATO s first major mission beyond the borders of Europe  has been overlooked and undermanned by many members of the alliance  including the United States  Success in Afghanistan is critical to American national security  and to the security of the entire world   And a failure there would not only endanger our nation and global stability   it would cast serious doubt on the ability of NATO s military and political architecture to uphold our security in the 21st century    Some new troop commitments to Afghanistan were made in Bucharest  and that is good news   But neither the Administration nor our allies have yet done enough to muster the resources that would win the war there and prevent Afghanistan from reemerging as a safe haven for the Taliban and al Qaeda   The Bucharest summit also left out one of three candidates for membership  and failed to provide the young democracies of Georgia and Ukraine with membership action plans   Mr  Volker  you are a professional diplomat of the first order and I have confidence that you will represent the United States ably in Brussels   However  ensuring that NATO retains its rightful place as the cornerstone of the Euro Atlantic alliance will require that we do more to enlarge NATO to include worthy European democracies  and focus more resources on the fight against the Taliban and al Qaeda   Doing so will require adroit diplomacy at NATO headquarters  but it will also mean making the case directly to the citizens of Europe that we must all increase our commitment to global security  We succeeded in coming together to confront the greatest challenges of the second half of the 20th century  We cannot succeed in confronting the challenges of the 21st unless we do so together   Mr  Urbancic  if confirmed you will be serving in Cyprus at a time of new optimism in the long struggle to bring an end to the estrangement of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities   After three decades  last Thursday s opening of the Ledra Street crossing in downtown Nicosia was a tangible indication of good will on both sides of the island to forge a settlement between two peoples who share a common home  a common history  and a common destiny   I hope that the day of Cypriot reunification comes in the course of your ambassadorial service  and that you will do everything in your power to help the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot community reach a just and lasting peace    Slovenia has been on the cutting edge of democratic change in Eastern Europe   Since its early success gaining membership in NATO and the European Union  it has been a model for progress in the Balkans   Despite its small size  Slovenia currently leads the nations of the European Union while it occupies the EU s presidency   Its citizens are helping to set the agenda for an entire continent   Slovenians are focusing Europe s attention on the unfinished business of bringing peace and prosperity to the Balkans   The people and government of Slovenia will need the help of the United States and other partners as they consolidate their democratic gains  and seek to extend those gains throughout the region  Mr  Ghafari  as an immigrant who has truly lived the American dream  you represent the strength found in our country s diversity   Similar strength should characterize life in the Balkans   in some parts of the region including Slovenia  it already does   I hope your story and your service will resonate with people throughout the former Yugoslavia  After a difficult transition from communism and setbacks in the 1990s  Bulgaria has made impressive economic strides in recent years   As a potential hub for oil and gas distribution  the country could play an important role in Europe s future energy security   However  Bulgaria continues to struggle with corruption and the corrosive influence of organized crime   Any failure to address these challenges could jeopardize the country s future cooperation with the European Union and  with it  much of the progress that has occurred in the recent past  Ms  McEldowney  you will need to work aggressively to assure that the democratic backsliding which has happened in some other parts of Eastern Europe does not occur in Bulgaria   The country s institutions and judicial system will need your support and assistance in order to help Bulgaria remain on course toward full Euro Atlantic integration   In recent years  the United States has dramatically reduced its financial assistance to Bulgaria  so you ll have to be creative   But your exemplary record as a member of the Foreign Service bodes well for your work on these critical tasks    Finally  Ms  Barrett  you have a different task  as you will represent America in a country that has travelled further down the path of democracy and prosperity   Finland is a world leader in technology and innovation  and even outranks the United States in some measures of development    But it still faces challenges in its relationship with Russia and its longstanding position outside of Euro Atlantic security institutions   At some point soon  Finland may move toward membership in NATO   Should the Finish people and government chose to pursue that objective  I hope you will be their biggest booster  All of you are coming before this Committee at a defining moment in America s story   Now is not a time for half hearted diplomacy   We need to raise the bar for our allies and that must begin with raising the bar for ourselves   Together with our partners in Europe  I am confident that we can make whole a world

  Veterans Administration Denied Health Care Services to Nearly 9 000 Illinois Veterans in 2005   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Veterans Administration Denied Health Care Services to Nearly 9 000 Illinois Veterans in 2005 Wednesday  January 25  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green    Date  January 25  2006  Veterans Administration Denied Health Care Services to Nearly 9 000 Illinois Veterans in 2005   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  denied health care to 8 944 Illinois veterans last year as part of a Bush Administration cost cutting policy begun in 2003  Nationally  more than 260 000 veterans were denied access to VA hospitals  clinics and medications in Fiscal Year 2005    The VA denied nearly 9 000 veterans in Illinois health care services they earned last year  This is an offensive and misguided way to balance the budget on veterans  backs   Obama said   These are vulnerable veterans  In Illinois  veterans making an average minimum of  36 600 who went to the VA looking for care were turned away     Since January 17  2003  the VA has refused to admit moderate income veterans who do not have a service connected disability  The 2003 cost cutting measure came after persistent underfunding of the VA budget  In 2005  the VA faced a  1 3 billion shortfall  even after turning away more than a quarter million veterans     Congressman Lane Evans  D 17   the Ranking Democratic Member of the House Veterans  Affairs Committee also criticized the VA policy    There is no reason for the VA to give the cold shoulder to veterans who have served our country honorably   said Evans   The problem is not that veterans are seeking health care from the VA  the problem is that the Administration would rather bar the doors and ration care than put forth an adequate budget to cover the needs of veterans     Senator Obama  a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee has consistently fought for additional VA funding  On June 23  2005  VA announced a budget shortfall of  1 3 billion from its FY2005 enacted level for veteran s health programs  On March 26  2005  Senator Obama voted to add an additional  2 85 billion to the VA health care budget  but the amendment was defeated  An amendment providing  1 5 billion in emergency funding was later signed into law    Later this week  Senators Obama  Akaka and other members of the Veterans Affairs Committee will send a letter to President Bush pressuring him to increase funding for VA health care in his 2007 budget request to be announced on February 6th    The VA s income cutoff varies by county  In Illinois  this averages  36 600 and ranges from a low of  27 350 in 36 rural and low income counties to  40 250 in the Chicago area  The 2005 national average for a single veteran was  25 842  A county by county list of income thresholds is pasted below    Since 2003  a total of nearly a half million veterans were turned away from VA care     Senator Obama Wednesday also praised  Veterans Care   a state level effort announced by Governor Rod Blagojevich last week to extend health coverage to veterans who do not have health insurance and who do not live within a reasonable driving distance of a VA hospital   Where the federal government is failing our heroes  the State of Illinois is filling the gap   Senator Obama said    Below

202 228 5511  Date  January 30  2007  Obama Offers Plan to Stop Escalation of Iraq War  Begin Phased Redeployment of Troops Goal to Redeploy All Combat Brigades out of Iraq by March 31  2008   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced binding and comprehensive legislation that not only reverses the President s dangerous and ill conceived escalation of the Iraq war  but also sets a new course for U S  policy that can bring a responsible end to the war and bring our troops home    Our troops have performed brilliantly in Iraq  but no amount of American soldiers can solve the political differences at the heart of somebody else s civil war   Obama said   That s why I have introduced a plan to not only stop the escalation of this war  but begin a phased redeployment that can pressure the Iraqis to finally reach a political settlement and reduce the violence     The Obama plan offers a responsible yet effective alternative to the President s failed policy of escalation   Realizing there can be no military solution in Iraq  it focuses instead on reaching a political solution in Iraq  protecting our interests in the region  and bringing this war to a responsible end   The legislation commences redeployment of U S  forces no later than May 1  2007 with the goal of removing all combat brigades from Iraq by March 31  2008  a date that is consistent with the expectation of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group    The plan allows for a limited number of U S  troops to remain as basic force protection  to engage in counter terrorism  and to continue the training of Iraqi security forces   If the Iraqis are successful in meeting the thirteen benchmarks for progress laid out by the Bush Administration  this plan also allows for the temporary suspension of the redeployment  provided Congress agrees that the benchmarks have been met and that the suspension is in the national security interest of the United States     The American people have been asked to be patient too many times  too many lives have been lost and too many billions have been spent   Obama said   It s time for a policy that can bring a responsible end to this war and bring our troops home    Fact Sheet  The Iraq War De escalation Act of 2007 Today  Senator Obama introduced the Iraq War De escalation Act of 2007   The Iraq War De escalation Act of 2007 is binding and comprehensive legislation that not only reverses the President s dangerous and ill conceived escalation  but also sets a new course for U S  policy in Iraq that can bring a responsible end to the war and bring our troops home   It implements   with the force of law   a phased redeployment of U S  forces that remains our best leverage to pressure the Iraqi government to achieve the political solution necessary to promote stability   It also places conditions on future economic aid to the government of Iraq and calls for the United States to lead a broad and sustained diplomatic initiative within the region   This plan is based on Senator Obama s November 20th  2006 speech before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs  and it implements key recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group     The Obama plan offers a responsible yet effective alternative to the President s failed policy of escalation   Realizing there can be no military solution in Iraq  it focuses instead on reaching a political solution in Iraq  protecting our interests in the region  and bringing this war to a responsible end   The legislation commences redeployment of U S  forces no later than May 1  2007 with the goal of removing all combat brigades from Iraq by March 31  2008  a date that is consistent with the expectation of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group   The plan allows for a limited number of U S  troops to remain as basic force protection  to engage in counter terrorism  and to continue the training of Iraqi security forces   If the Iraqis are successful in meeting the thirteen benchmarks for progress laid out by the Bush Administration  this plan also allows for the temporary suspension of the redeployment  provided Congress agrees that the benchmarks have been met and that the suspension is in the national security interest of the United States     In short  the Obama plan halts the escalation and requires a responsible  phased redeployment of American forces from Iraq in a manner that protects U S  troops and exerts leverage to achieve the political settlement among the Iraqis   Key Elements of Obama Plan Stops the Escalation  Caps the number of U S  troops in Iraq at the number in Iraq on January 10  2007   This does not affect the funding for our troops in Iraq  This cap has the force of law and could not be lifted without explicit Congressional authorization  De escalates the War with Phased Redeployment   Commences a phased redeployment of U S  troops out of Iraq not later than May 1  2007  with the goal that all combat brigades redeploy from Iraq by March 31  2008  a date consistent with the expectation of the Iraq Study Group   This redeployment will be both substantial and gradual  and will be planned and implemented by military commanders   Makes clear that Congress believes troops should be redeployed to the United States  to Afghanistan  and to other points in the region  A residual U S  presence may remain in Iraq for force protection  training of Iraqi security forces  and pursuit of international terrorists  Enforces Tough Benchmarks for Progress    These 13 benchmarks are based on President Bush s own statements and Administration documents and include  Security  Significant progress toward fulfilling security commitments  including eliminating restrictions on U S  forces  reducing sectarian violence  reducing the size and influence of the militias  and strengthening the Iraqi Army and Police  Political Accommodation  Significant progress toward reaching a political solution  including equitable sharing of oil revenues  revision of de Baathification  provincial elections  even handed provision of government services  and a fair process for a constitutional amendment to achieve national reconciliation  Economic Progress   Requires Iraq to fulfill its commitment to spend not less than  10 billion for reconstruction  job creation  and economic development without regard for the ethnic or sectarian make up of Iraqi regions    Should these benchmarks be met  the plan allows for the temporary suspension of this redeployment  subject to the agreement of Congress    Congressional oversight   Requires the President to submit reports to Congress every 90 days describing and assessing the Iraqi government s progress in meeting benchmarks and the redeployment goals  Intensified Training  Intensifies training of Iraqi security forces to enable the country to take over security responsibility of the country  Conditions on Economic Assistance   Conditions future economic assistance to the Government of Iraq on significant progress toward achievement of benchmarks   Allows exceptions for humanitarian  security  and job creation assistance   Regional Diplomacy  Launches a comprehensive regional and international diplomatic initiative   that includes key nations in the region   to help achieve a political settlement among the Iraqi people  end the civil war in Iraq

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green    Date  February 24  2006  Obama Joins Local Law Enforcement to Discuss Federal Cuts that Would Hurt Their Ability to Keep Our Communities Safe   SPRINGFIELD   Joined by Illinois law enforcement  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today said that the President s 2007 budget will hamper police officers  efforts to keep our communities safe by eliminating funding that has been crucial in fighting violent crime across the state and putting more police on the streets    The President s budget would eliminate a critical source of assistance to police departments  the Byrne Memorial Grant Program  This year  more than 40 Illinois communities are splitting  12 9 million for Byrne Grants  Next year  they would receive nothing under the President s proposal  These grants help communities fight violent crime and provide assistance to victims of crime  Money provided by Byrne grants has been crucial in helping communities across Illinois join forces to combat this drug  In 2004 alone  Byrne grants helped Illinois cops make 1 267 methamphetamine related arrests and seize 348 923 grams of meth    The budgets that come out of Washington never cease to amaze me   said Obama   With all their numbers and programs and earmarks  they don t make for the most exciting news  but they do make clear what the priorities of the President and the Congress are  The decision to eliminate Byrne Grants and slash the COPS program is one that gives criminals and drug dealers a break by taking cops off the streets       Throughout Illinois and across the country  cities and towns and local law enforcement have been in the fight of their lives to fight drugs and the related rise in crime   said Obama   But the Byrne Grants have made a real difference  For the State Police  this funding pays the salaries for the officers who patrol our streets  In some of the smaller towns with limited resources  the staff provided by these grants partners with local task forces and serve as the town s only chance to fight rising drug use and violence  In southern Illinois  Byrne grants have made a huge difference for law enforcement trying to fight the meth epidemic      How can we argue with this success  How can we look at all this progress and tell these communities that this year  when it comes to keeping drugs and criminals off their streets  they re on their own   In the coming weeks and months  I will be fighting to restore the funding for Byrne Grants so that local law enforcement can continue fighting crime     Obama also noted that the President s Budget cuts the Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  program by 80 percent  In 2005  COPS provided  7 4 million for hiring police officers in more than 60 Illinois Communities  Since 1994  the program has funded 5 854 police officers in Illinois with grants topping  416 million  Since 1994  Illinois has received more than  45 million in COPS grants to purchase crime fighting technologies   an average of  2 8 million per year in equipment that helps law enforcement save time  share information  and improve communications  The President s budget would completely eliminate funding for crime fighting technologies under the COPS program    Participants at today s meeting and press conference

                                          Obama  Harkin Introduce Low Carbon Fuel Standard that Would Reduce Emissions  Dependence on Foreign Oil Monday  May  7  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt  Obama  or Kate Cyrul  Harkin    Legislation would expand the renewable fuels market to reduce carbon emissions WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Harkin  D IA  today introduced legislation establishing a National Low Carbon Fuel Standard that would reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions in the short and long term   The bill requires a reduction of about 180 million metric tons in emissions in 2020     the equivalent of taking over 30 million cars off the road   The Obama Harkin fuel standard embraces the growth of the renewable fuels market  including corn based ethanol  cellulosic ethanol  and biodiesel as a key component of fighting climate change  while incentivizing lower carbon emissions in their production         Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles is one of the most aggressive and immediate steps we can take to fight climate change     said Senator Obama      Expanding the renewable fuels market in the United States will reduce our dependence on foreign oil  revitalize our agricultural sector  and provide a sustainable means to combat global warming   A homegrown solution to the international climate crisis lies in America   s fields and farms             It   s time to act on climate change     said Senator Harkin  Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee      We   ve got to begin reducing greenhouse gas emissions  and emissions from our vehicles need to be a part of that   This bill sets a standard that establishes a steady downward trend for life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of our transportation fuels   Because biofuels generally have lower life cycle greenhouse gas emissions  this bill also promotes rural economic development and national energy security         The U S  relies on imports for 60  of the petroleum it consumes  and the oil used in the U S  transportation sector accounts for one third of our nation   s emissions of greenhouse gases   Senators Obama and Harkin have introduced a bill establishing a National Low Carbon Fuel Standard  NLCFS  that will reduce both our dependence on foreign oil and our greenhouse gas emissions   The National Low Carbon Fuel Standard Act of 2007 will   Provide near term demand certainty to renewable fuel producers  The Renewable Fuel Standard in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 will be expanded in the near term to require 15 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2012  Expand the market for low carbon fuels over the long term  The NLCFS requires fuel refiners that produce petroleum based fuels to reduce the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of the transportation fuels sold in the U S  by 5 percent in 2015 and 10 percent in 2020   Because most biofuels have lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline  the NLCFS will greatly expand the market for renewable fuels such as corn based ethanol  cellulosic ethanol  and biodiesel while incentivizing lower carbon emissions in their production  By one estimate  the NLCFS will create a market for over 40 billion gallons of biofuels by 2020  Drive the production of ultra low carbon fuels   The bill requires fuel refiners to use minimum amounts of fuels with 50 and 75 percent lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline  This requirement signals to investors that there will be a market for advanced fuels  but still allows significant leeway for fuel refiners to choose the optimal mix of fuels to meet their overall greenhouse gas emissions targets  Utilize a credit trading mechanism  Fuel refiners can trade allowances or bank them against future carbon reduction requirements   Ensure an environmentally sustainable biofuels expansion  The bill ensures that the expansion of biofuels production does not impact national wildlife refuges  national parks  national forests  old growth forests  or national grasslands  The bill calls for an assessment of the impacts of the expansion  including a comparison to the business as usual scenario of continued reliance on petroleum based transportation fuels  and the development of standards by 2012 to protect air  land  and water quality  Achieve a major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions  According to one estimate  the NLCFS would reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by about 180 million metric tons in 2020   This is the equivalent of taking over 30 million cars off the road in 2020   If enacted in conjunction with a bill  S  768  proposed by Senator Obama to raise fuel efficiency standards  the NLCFS would reduce emissions by about 530 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2020  the equivalent of taking over 50 million cars off the road  Achieve a major reduction in oil imports  By making greater use of home grown  renewable fuels  the NLCFS could reduce the annual consumption of gasoline derived from foreign oil imports by about 30 billion gallons in 2020                                    ,Obama

tens of thousands missing  with disease spreading rampantly throughout the flooded country  The resolution was cosponsored by Foreign Relations Chairman Joe Biden  D DE   Ranking Member Richard Lugar  R IN   Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell  R KY   along with Senators Dianne Feinstein  D CA   Dick Durbin  D IL   Chris Dodd  D CT   Barack Obama  D IL   Jim Webb  D VA   Lisa Murkowski  R AK   Ted Kennedy  D MA   Bob Menendez  D NJ    Russ Feingold  D WI   Joe Lieberman  D CT  Chuck Hagel  R NE   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Hillary Clinton  D N Y    Mary Landrieu  D LA  and Elizabeth Dole  R N C   The senators requested that the Bush Administration send the aid they have promised the troubled nation  and also sustain humanitarian aid to the Burmese people beyond the immediate crisis created by Cyclone Nargis  The resolution also asked that any restrictions placed by Burma s State Peace and Development Council on international non governmental organizations be lifted  so that they can freely lend assistance  medical attention and funds to the victims of the disaster  Lastly  the resolution asks that the United States Agency for International Development conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the organizations capable of navigating these political roadblocks to effectively lend assistance to the Burmese people   The full text of the resolution can be found at this     At this tragic moment  the United States has a responsibility to help the Burmese people and push the junta to allow humanitarian aid to get to the people who need it the most  freely and rapidly   said Kerry   This could be remembered as the moment when the United States and the world came to the aid of the Burmese people and made it clear that while we loathe the junta that has isolated Burma from the world and oppressed its citizens  we find common cause with the people of Burma and we will be there by their side at this difficult time    We re hearing reports that the death toll in Burma may reach over 100 000   making it one of the most fatal disasters in modern history   said Biden    The United States and the international community have a moral obligation to step up and offer immediate humanitarian assistance to the region    The Burmese government has to do its part as well  by allowing in aid workers and lifting restrictions on the flow of international assistance   Together  we must act now in order to prevent disease  starvation and a lack of resources from claiming even more lives    The U S  Senate makes this emphatic humanitarian statement  expressing our sympathy for the people of Burma  and encouraging that all possible assistance is extended quickly to them   said Lugar   My prayers go out to the families of those killed  injured or missing in this past weekend s natural disaster in Burma   said McConnell    It is my profound hope that the regime will permit the U S  to help the Burmese people recover from this tragedy    Cyclone Nargis has left a path of death and destruction in its wake  The people of Burma are in desperate need for food  shelter  medical assistance and other humanitarian aid   Feinstein said   It s our hope that the military regime will open the country to disaster assessment teams and international aid from the United States and other nations who stand ready to help    Cyclone Nargis has left a path of devastation and despair across Burma  and we must take immediate steps to help alleviate the dreadful living conditions that the survivors are facing   said Dodd    The road to recovery will be long  and we must stand ready to aid the Burmese people as they begin to pick up the pieces   In light of this unprecedented need for humanitarian aid  I sincerely hope that the State Peace and Development Council will lift current restrictions on foreign assistance in Burma and allow the United States to provide the aid that is so desperately needed    The tragedy in Burma is heartbreaking   said Obama    I support the United States  commitment to deploying disaster assistance and aid to the region  and I urge the Burmese government to take the steps necessary to ensure the international community can provide help to those who need it      Through tragedy  there may be some hope for the future for the citizens of Burma   After years of being isolated from the rest of the world  the United States along with the international community can use this opportunity to assist Burma and demonstrate good will towards the Burmese people   said Webb   The time is ripe to move beyond the strategy of isolation and sanctions and toward the goal of opening up Burma   I am hopeful that the administration will move forward in that spirit and that the Government of Burma will accept the outpouring of international aid and allow international relief organizations access throughout the country      I have the utmost sympathy and support for the people of Burma   said Murkowski    I want to assure them that the United States will provide assistance in this time of great need   As citizens of not only the United States  but of the whole world we must come to each other s aid in times of such terrible disasters    As the tragedy continues to unfold in Burma  the United States should take a firm leadership role in providing a decisive  generous humanitarian response   said Kennedy    The Burmese Government must do its part as well and allow assistance to reach those in need   Menendez said   We are standing together as Americans  as citizens of the world  ready and willing to do what it takes to help the Burmese people get food  water and shelter and recover as best they can from this unimaginable tragedy  Unless the ruling military junta in Burma lets international aid workers provide assistance freely throughout that nation  the mind boggling death tolls will rise and the extreme suffering will continue  Now is not a time to consolidate power  it is a time to accept the world s cooperation and compassion    The devastation caused by the cyclone in Burma is tragic and overwhelming but Americans stand ready to help the people of Burma in any way we can   Feingold said    The Burmese government must lift its restrictions and allow the international community to help prevent the further loss of life      This bipartisan resolution sends an unmistakable message to the Burmese people that the United States stands ready to help them in the wake of this terrible natural disaster  Rather than compounding the suffering of the Burmese people  it is now critical that the military junta put aside its paranoia  lift restrictions on the delivery of aid  and allow its people to receive the humanitarian relief they so desperately need   said Lieberman   Devastating humanitarian disasters like these do not heed borders  boundaries or political circumstances   They affect only the innocent  and we all need to work towards the common goal of easing their plight   I urge the Burmese Government to accept our offer of immediate humanitarian assistance   Hagel said   We in Louisiana understand the wrath of a catastrophic natural disaster   Landrieu said   Countries all over the world came to our aid in 2005  and we now have the moral responsibility to get aid to Burma as quickly and efficiently as we can to help the suffering survivors  The military junta must back down and let the international community bring critical resources to the Burmese people    From my time with the American Red Cross  I know first hand how important the humanitarian response is to those who are suffering   There is much to be done in the wake of Cyclone Nargis and time is of the essence   Aid to the people must not be hindered  and I urge the military junta to let the United States help   said Dole                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this

Appropriations Committee to suspend targeted assistance in light of state of emergency declaration   WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today wrote to Senator Robert Byrd  Chairman and Senator Thad Cochran  Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations  urging Congress to set conditions on U S  assistance to Pakistan in light of President Musharraf s declaration of a state of emergency this weekend    The Senate and House are currently negotiating the FY08 State Department Foreign Operations appropriations bill  which includes some of the U S  aid to Pakistan   In the letter  Obama asks the Committee to continue funding for Pakistan in the Foreign Operations bill in the areas of counter terrorism funding  public education  health  micro enterprise development  humanitarian assistance  and democracy  and rule of law programs  but temporarily suspend all other funding for Pakistan in the Foreign Operations bill until the Administration certifies that   1  U S  funds are not being used to repress democracy in Pakistan  2  parliamentary elections have been scheduled  media restrictions have been lifted  and those people imprisoned because of the state of emergency have been released  and 3  the Pakistani government has developed a strategy to combat Taliban and al Qaeda forces    Below is a copy of the letter    November 8  2007  The Honorable Robert C  Byrd  Chairman  The Honorable Thad Cochran  Ranking Member  Committee on Appropriations  S 131  The Capitol  Washington  DC 20510    Dear Chairman Byrd and Senator Cochran    I am writing regarding the troubling news from Pakistan over the weekend that President Musharraf has declared a state of emergency and has engaged in widespread and illegal arrests and other measures    Pakistan is an important ally to the United States  and for this reason  I have been proud to support significant investments in its stability and economic development over the last several years   At the same time  however  the developments over the weekend raise very serious concerns about President Musharraf s commitment to return Pakistan to a democratic path    In reaction to this news from Pakistan  Secretary Rice has pledged to review U S  assistance to Pakistan   As you know  in the context of the programs funded by the State Department Foreign Operations appropriations bill  the Administration requested roughly  845 million dollars in the regular and supplemental appropriations for FY  08   I agree that a wholesale review of U S  assistance to Pakistan is warranted in light of these recent events  but I am not confident the Administration will conduct the thorough review this situation demands  and I believe aggressive Congressional oversight of this review is vital    As such  I am requesting that you use the Senate House conference on the Foreign Operations appropriations bill  which includes foreign military financing  bilateral economic assistance  democracy assistance  and development assistance for Pakistan  to make sure that U S  taxpayer investments in Pakistan are making clear our strong support for the Pakistani people and are advancing our interests in democracy and the fight against Taliban and al Qaeda extremists in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan    I would request  specifically  that the Committee continue funding for Pakistan in the Foreign Operations bill in the areas of counter terrorism funding  public education  health  micro enterprise development  humanitarian assistance  and democracy and rule of law programs  and temporarily suspend all other funding for Pakistan in the Foreign Operations bill until such time as the Administration certifies that its review of assistance is complete and certifies further that    1 None of our assistance is being used to repress the democratic aspirations of the people of Pakistan    2 Parliamentary elections have been scheduled  restrictions on the media imposed as a result of the state of emergency have been lifted  and those imprisoned or placed under house arrest as a result of state of emergency have been freed  and   3 The Government of Pakistan has developed a comprehensive strategy to root out Taliban and al Qaeda forces in northwest Pakistan    I thank you in advance for the consideration of my request    Sincerely   Barack Obama  United States Senator cc

Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  August 10  2005  Obama Criticizes VA Decision to Review 72 000 Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Cases VA Review Only Includes Vets Awarded Full Benefits  not Those Denied   WASHINGTON   In a letter to Veterans  Affairs Secretary Jim Nicholson  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today criticized the VA s decision to review more than 70 000 cases where veterans were awarded full benefits for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  cases  while not reviewing any cases where veterans may have been denied benefits they earned     In order to truly create fairness in the claims system  the VA should concentrate its efforts on reviewing denials of PTSD claims   said Obama   Without assessing why some PTSD claims are denied  it will be impossible to fully understand how the VA s PTSD rating system can be improved     According to recent news reports  the VA will review 72 000 cases in which the maximum amount of PTSD disability benefits was awarded because of the VA s belief that 2 5  of these cases are  potentially fraudulent   Obama said this review is long and stressful  and that veterans should not be forced to unnecessarily prove their cases again     The process of gathering evidence to prove PTSD disability is extremely time consuming   said Obama   It requires the compilation of medical records  military service records  and testimony from other veterans who can attest to a person s combat exposure  I cannot fathom why VA would require veterans to go through this emotionally painful process for a second time     Previously  the VA considered adopting a policy that required any new case where a veteran is awarded service connected PTSD benefits to be reviewed by two raters  Senator Obama raised his objections with this policy in a letter dated June 21  2005  The policy was later discarded  Obama said the VA should create uniform standards for evaluating PTSD claims     The VA   and our nation s veterans   would be better served by creating nationwide standards for evaluating PTSD claims   said Obama   As the Inspector General s report underscored  PTSD is a highly subjective evaluation subject to significant variation  The variation in PTSD ratings across the country may well be the result of a lack of training or standardized practices on the part of the VA  instead of fraud on the part of our nation s veterans      In December  Senator Obama learned that Illinois veterans have received disproportionately less disability pay  on average  than veterans in 49 of the 52 states and territories for the past two decades  Obama asked the VA to issue a report detailing how this disparity occurred  which found that  variance in 100 percent PTSD cases is a primary factor contributing to the variance in average annual compensation by state   For example  New Mexico has the highest payment average of  12 004  and 12 6 percent of its veterans are in this group  Illinois has the lowest average payment of  6 961 and only 2 8 percent of its compensation recipients are rated 100 percent for PTSD     The Senate VA committee recently passed the Veterans  Benefits Improvement Act of 2005  which included an amendment offered by Senator Obama to require the VA to standardize the assessment of PTSD claims     August 10  2005   The Honorable R  James Nicholson  Secretary of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue  NW  Washington  D C  20420   Dear Secretary Nicholson                I am writing to express my serious concerns about recent news reports that the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  is reviewing 72 000 post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  cases between 1999 and 2004 in which veterans received the maximum amount of disability benefits   This appears to be yet another attempt by the Bush Administration to put roadblocks in front of veterans who are trying to obtain the benefits they earned and deserve                I first raised this issue with you in a letter dated June 21  2005   In that letter  I strongly objected to a VA proposal to require a concurring second signature for PTSD cases in which benefits were granted   I was concerned that the VA had no similar plans to examine whether veterans were being unfairly denied PTSD claims and was only interested in determining whether some veterans were getting too much money   While I recognize the budgetary crisis that the VA is facing  it is wrong for the VA to ignore the possibility that many veterans have been unjustly denied their earned benefits                      In your response to my letter dated July 6  2005  you indicated that VA would not pursue the proposed second signature policy   I was pleased with the change in policy  but I am disturbed that the VA has now chosen to ignore my initial concerns                 According to an August 9  2005  article in Salon  the VA will review 72 000 cases in which the maximum amount of PTSD disability benefits was awarded because of VA s belief that 2 5  of these cases are  potentially fraudulent     It is inherently unfair to review only cases in which PTSD benefits were granted while ignoring cases in which benefits were denied                 Equally troubling is the message that such a mandatory review of PTSD claims sends to the brave men and women who defended this country   Too many veterans see the VA as a bureaucracy with the singular goal of denying services and benefits to veterans   This recent decision to reopen granted PTSD claims merely serves to promote that impression   It is unconscionable for our government to put the onus on law abiding veterans to affirmatively demonstrate that they are not engaging in fraud   The process of gathering evidence to prove PTSD disability is extremely time consuming   It requires the compilation of medical records  military service records  and testimony from other veterans who can attest to a person s combat exposure   I cannot fathom why VA would require veterans to go through this emotionally painful process for a second time       The VA   and our nation s veterans   would be better served by creating nationwide standards for evaluating PTSD claims   As the Inspector General s report underscored  PTSD is a highly subjective evaluation subject to significant variation   The variation in PTSD ratings across the country may well be the result of a lack of training or standardized practices on the part of the VA  instead of fraud on the part of our nation s veterans     In order to truly create fairness in the claims system  the VA should concentrate its efforts on reviewing denials of PTSD claims   Without assessing why some PTSD claims are denied  it will be impossible to fully understand how the VA s PTSD rating system can be improved   In any event  any analysis of PTSD claims should not require veterans to readjudicate their claims   The veterans  disability benefits process is already long and

studies  a large majority of the approximately 20 30 million renovations done on older homes each year are done without lead safe cleanup and contamination practices  Over 430 000 children in America have dangerously high levels of lead in their blood    In 1992  Congress required the EPA to write regulations relating to the dispersal of lead paint by contractors during home remodeling by October  1996  As of July 2005  these regulations still have not been written  In April  Administrator Johnson stated that to address the problem of lead paint poisoning  the EPA  will determine what additional steps may be necessary  including regulation  despite the fact that the 1992 law does not say the regulations are optional    When asked about the status of these regulations before the EPW Committee two weeks ago  Deputy Administrator designate Marcus Peacock stated    As I understand it  the Agency will announce by the end of this year a comprehensive program  which will include a proposed regulation  as well as an extensive education and outreach campaign aimed at the renovation  repair  and painting industry and the consumer     Obama also received a letter from Susan Hazen  Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator  which said   the Agency plans to announce by the end of this year  a comprehensive program that will include a proposed rule     In light of commitments I have received from Mr  Peacock and Ms  Hazen  I voted last Wednesday to confirm Mr  Peacock for the deputy administrator position   Obama wrote   However  I want you to know that I will be closely monitoring EPA s actions regarding lead paint and will expect proposed rules to be issued by December 31  2005     Full text of the letter below     July 25  2005   The Honorable Stephen L  Johnson  Administrator  U S  Environmental Protection Agency  401 M Street  SW  Washington  DC  20460   Dear Administrator Johnson    As you may know  I have been concerned about the failure of the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to promulgate regulations pursuant to 15 U S C  S2682 c  3    This provision requires EPA to issue rules for contractors to reduce lead exposure during home renovation and remodeling by October 1996   Almost nine years later  these rules still have not been issued  and I have spent the past few months trying to understand why    When your nomination was considered by the Senate Environment and Public Works  EPW  Committee in April  I asked you when EPA was going to issue these rules   You stated that EPA was focusing on a voluntary education and outreach program and  will evaluate the effectiveness of this effort and will determine what additional steps may be necessary  including regulation    Of course  15 U S C  S2682 c  3  does not give EPA the option of whether to promulgate regulations     In May  Sen  Boxer  Rep  Waxman  and I wrote a follow up letter to you  asking once again when EPA would issue these rules on lead   We received no response for two months    In June  I included an amendment in the EPA appropriations bill that would prohibit the agency from spending any funds to delay the implementation of 15 U S C  S2682 c  3    That bill passed the Senate unanimously    When Deputy Administrator designate Marcus Peacock appeared before the EPW Committee two weeks ago  I asked him about the status of these lead rules   Responding to written questions that I submitted to him after the hearing  Mr  Peacock stated    As I understand it  the Agency will announce by the end of this year a comprehensive program  which will include a proposed regulation  as well as an extensive education and outreach campaign aimed at the renovation  repair  and painting industry and the consumer     I am pleased by Mr  Peacock s statement  which is a significant departure from your response in April   I am also encouraged by a letter I received last week from Susan Hazen  Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator  responding to my May letter   Ms  Hazen reiterated that  the Agency plans to announce by the end of this year  a comprehensive program that will include a proposed rule     In light of the commitments I received from Mr  Peacock and Ms  Hazen  I voted last Wednesday to confirm Mr  Peacock for the deputy administrator position   However  I want you to know that I will be closely monitoring EPA s actions regarding lead paint and will expect you to honor your commitment to issue these proposed rules by December 31  2005     I look forward to working with you on this important issue     Sincerely     Barack Obama  United States Senator                                   ,Obama

  Obama  USDA Should Not Undermine Legislation to Help Black Farmers   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  USDA Should Not Undermine Legislation to Help Black Farmers Wednesday  August  8  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Obama Press Office  202 228 5566 Reports show USDA employees improperly lobbied against Pigford legislation WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today called on Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns to examine recent allegations that USDA employees used federal resources to lobby against legislation that would allow black farmers to file claims under the Pigford settlement   According to federal law and USDA policies  the use of federal resources for lobbying members of Congress is strictly prohibited   The Pigford settlement  approved in 1999  allowed black farmers to file claims against the USDA for failing to respond to racial discrimination complaints between 1983 and 1997   Recently passed legislation in the House of Representatives would allow certain previously denied farmers an opportunity to re file their settlement claims and have them reviewed on their merits   Obama has introduced companion legislation  S  1989  in the Senate  The text of the letter is below    Dear Secretary Johanns  I am writing to express my serious concerns regarding recent reports that U S  Department of Agriculture   USDA   employees are using federal resources to lobby against recently passed legislation   Specifically  news reports indicate that certain USDA Farm Services Agency employees have been circulating an e mail encouraging their colleagues to contact members of Congress to oppose provisions in the House passed Farm Bill   The targeted provisions would provide unjustly denied black farmers an opportunity to have their claims filed pursuant to the Pigford settlement reviewed on the merits  As you know  the use of federal resources for lobbying is specifically prohibited by 18 U S C    1913  which prohibits the use of appropriated funds for activities that directly or indirectly are  intended or designed to influence in any manner a Member of Congress  to favor  adopt  or oppose       any legislation  law  ratification  or appropriation  whether before or after the introduction of any bill   As the   this statute is  interpreted to prohibit government employees from engaging in substantial grass roots lobbying campaigns using telegrams  letters  or other forms of communication that directly or indirectly encourage the public to contact members of Congress in support of  or in opposition to  legislation       The e mails referenced in various media accounts appear to violate both USDA ethics guidance and federal law   The news reports note that some USDA employees have circulated a message urging their colleagues to rally against the Pigford provision in the House passed Farm Bill   The e mails quote Carolyn Cooksie  Deputy Administrator for Farm Loan Programs as saying it would be  awful  to allow 73 000 late filers to qualify for awards   The e mails go on to warn of what would happen if the bill passes  The agency will be required to submit a boatload of information within 60 days of anyone filing which will bury us   Not to mention  most of this information we don t have        Carolyn is doing a lot of legwork in the Senate trying to stop it but NACS  National Association of Credit Specialists   NASE  and other FSA  Farm Service Agency  employees need to contact their senators and work hard to get it stopped   The contacts need to be made before the debate starts in the Senate        Remember  don t make contacts using the office telephone or computer   Send your contacts from home or from another location other than the office  but send them  I appreciate that Farm Services Agency employees have received a memorandum reminding them of the legal prohibitions against lobbying with federal resources   However  the employees  e mails raise a larger question of whether the Department is capable even now of providing black farmers   and all farmers   with fair and equal access to USDA loans and services   As you are well aware  the Pigford settlement was an acknowledgement that black farmers suffered discrimination from the USDA for many years   It is unconscionable that some USDA employees appear to be more concerned about their workloads than on correcting a serious injustice   I ask that you publicly disavow the apparent efforts of these employees to undermine the attempts to provide justice to Pigford claimants   I also ask that you notify me by August 15  2007  as to what steps you have taken to remedy this situation and prevent a recurrence  including employee training or disciplinary action   Thank you  Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator                                   ,Obama

translation of this weeks   D IL     Good morning  this is Senator Barack Obama from Illinois    Over the last few weeks  Im sure youve heard a lot of talk about cleaning up the corruption in Washington  Youve heard about lobbying reform and the K Street project and Jack Abramoff and corrupt politicians    But there is more to these scandals than expensive travels or gifts to Republican lawmakers   Whats truly offensive about these scandals is that they dont just lead to morally offensive conduct on the part of politicians  they lead to morally offensive legislation that hurts hardworking Americans     In the last few weeks  weve seen a budget that gives seven billion dollars to oil companies at a time when families cant afford to fill up their gas tanks or heat their homes    Weve seen secret deals that give  22 billion to the health care industry at a time where forty five million people in the United States have no insurance and millions more are struggling to pay their medical bills      Weve seen billions in student loans slashed at a time when its getting harder to attend college    This is why the American people dont trust Washington today   This is whats offending them on a moral level   And this is what we need to clean up today    The Democrats Honest Leadership and Open Government Act will help curb these abuses by closing the revolving door that allows lawmakers and staff to leave their jobs to go lobby without disclosing it to the public     It makes sure that those closed door conference committee meetings where special interest provisions are secretly slipped in bills are forever open to the public     It stops lobbyists from currying favor with lawmakers through gifts and trips   And it creates an independent Office of Public Integrity to carry out these rules        In the Presidents State of the Union address  he spoke for forty six minutes before he finally dedicated only sixty words to ethics reform   This is unacceptable     We need a serious commitment to reform   This is a time to clean up Washington once and for all     This is Senator Barack Obama from Illinois   Thank you for listening      En las ultimas semanas  hemos visto un presupuesto que otorga siete mil millones de dolares a las empresas petroleras  cuando a las familias no les alcanza para pagar por un tanque de gasolina o para la calefaccion de sus hogares     Hemos visto acuerdos secretos que le dan  22 mil millones a la industria medica  cuando cuarenta y cinco millones de personas en los Estados Unidos no tienen seguro medico y millones mas no pueden pagar sus cuentas medicas     Hemos visto miles de millones en prestamos para estudiantes eliminados cuando cada ano cuesta mas ir a la universidad    Por eso hoy la gente no confia en Washington  Esto es lo que los ofende moralmente  Y esto es lo que necesitamos eliminar     La Ley del Liderazgo Honesto y Gobierno Transparente de los Democratas  ayudara a evitar abusos al cerrar la puerta que permite que legisladores y su personal dejen sus empleos para irse a cabildear  sin informar al publico      Asegura que las reuniones de comite de conferencia donde se incluyen en secreto medidas para los influyentes  esten siempre abiertas al publico      Evita que los cabilderos busquen favores de los legisladores a traves de regalos o viajes  Y crea una Oficina

Illinois   Gracias por escuchar    Contact   Fabiola Rodriguez Ciampoli  Democratic Leader   202 228 5352  Tommy Vietor  Sen  Obama   202  228 5511   Senator Barack Obama  D IL  to Deliver Democratic Hispanic Radio Address   Following is the translation of this week s   D IL      Good morning  this is Senator Barack Obama from Illinois     Over the last few weeks  I m sure you ve heard a lot of talk about cleaning up the corruption in Washington  You ve heard about lobbying reform and the K Street project and Jack Abramoff and corrupt politicians     But there is more to these scandals than expensive travels or gifts to Republican lawmakers   What s truly offensive about these scandals is that they don t just lead to morally offensive conduct on the part of politicians  they lead to morally offensive legislation that hurts hardworking Americans      In the last few weeks  we ve seen a budget that gives seven billion dollars to oil companies at a time when families can t afford to fill up their gas tanks or heat their homes     We ve seen secret deals that give  22 billion to the health care industry at a time where forty five million people in the United States have no insurance and millions more are struggling to pay their medical bills       We ve seen billions in student loans slashed at a time when it s getting harder to attend college     This is why the American people don t trust Washington today   This is what s offending them on a moral level   And this is what we need to clean up today     The Democrats  Honest Leadership and Open Government Act will help curb these abuses by closing the revolving door that allows lawmakers and staff to leave their jobs to go lobby without disclosing it to the public      It makes sure that those closed door conference committee meetings where special interest provisions are secretly slipped in bills are forever open to the public      It stops lobbyists from currying favor with lawmakers through gifts and trips   And it creates an independent Office of Public Integrity to carry out these rules         In the President s State of the Union address  he spoke for forty six minutes before he finally dedicated only sixty words to ethics reform   This is unacceptable      We need a serious commitment to reform   This is a time to clean up Washington once and for all      This is Senator Barack Obama from Illinois   Thank you for listening                                     ,Obama

  Growing Momentum Behind Obama  Thompson  Murphy Redeployment Plan   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Growing Momentum Behind Obama  Thompson  Murphy Redeployment Plan Thursday  March  8  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Members of Congress  Including Republicans  Support Iraq War De escalation Act WASHGINTON  DC     The Iraq De escalation plan introduced by Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and U S  Representatives Mike Thompson  D CA  and Patrick Murphy  D PA  has gained the support of 62 Members of Congress  including 3 Republicans    This momentum comes as public support continues to grow for an Iraq plan that will hold Iraqis accountable to benchmarks  prevent our troops from refereeing a civil war  and remove combat brigades from Iraq by early 2008       Because of the President   s failed strategy  and despite the valiant efforts of our troops  our military options in Iraq have been exhausted     said Senator Barack Obama      The American people and the new Congressional majority  along with some wise Republicans  agree that we should begin to redeploy our troops from Iraq so that a political solution can be found       Setting a timeline for redeployment is the right thing to do for our troops and our country   said Representative Thompson   This bill provides an achievable strategy for getting our combat troops out as safely and quickly as possible  while also helping the Iraqi government secure and rebuild its country  It s time to focus our resources on getting the Iraqi government and its neighbors to step up and take responsibility for Iraq s future     Our troops have done what s been asked of them  now it s time for the Iraqis to step up and fight for their country   A timeline will show the Iraqis that we will not be there indefinitely and that they need to come off the sidelines   said Representative Murphy    As someone who served in Baghdad with the 82nd Airborne Division  I can tell you that we need a political solution   not to send more American fighting men and women to referee an Iraqi civil war   This is about doing what s right for our country  and this is a tough  yet sensible plan to do just that    The De Escalation Act would    Stops the Escalation  Caps the number of U S  troops in Iraq at the number in Iraq on January 10  2007  This does not affect the funding for our troops in Iraq  This cap has the force of law and could not be lifted without explicit Congressional authorization  De escalates the War with Phased Redeployment  Commences a phased redeployment of U S  troops out of Iraq not later than May 1  2007  with the goal that all combat brigades redeploy from Iraq by March 31  2008  a date consistent with the expectation of the Iraq Study Group  This redeployment will be both substantial and gradual  and will be planned and implemented by military commanders  Makes clear that Congress believes troops should be redeployed to the United States  to Afghanistan  and to other points in the region  A residual U S  presence may remain in Iraq for force protection  training of Iraqi security forces  and pursuit of international terrorists  Enforces Tough Benchmarks for Progress  These 13 benchmarks are based on President Bush s own statements and Administration documents and include   Security  Significant progress toward fulfilling security commitments  including eliminating restrictions on U S  forces  reducing sectarian violence  reducing the size and influence of the militias  and strengthening the Iraqi Army and Police  Political Accommodation  Significant progress toward reaching a political solution  including equitable sharing of oil revenues  revision of de Baathification  provincial elections  even handed provision of government services  and a fair process for a constitutional amendment to achieve national reconciliation  Economic Progress  Requires Iraq to fulfill its commitment to spend not less than  10 billion for reconstruction  job creation  and economic development without regard for the ethnic or sectarian make up of Iraqi regions  Should these benchmarks be met  the plan allows for the temporary suspension of this redeployment  subject to the agreement of Congress   Congressional oversight  Requires the President to submit reports to Congress every 90 days describing and assessing the Iraqi government s progress in meeting benchmarks and the redeployment goals    Intensified Training  Intensifies training of Iraqi security forces to enable the country to take over security responsibility of the country    Conditions on Economic Assistance  Conditions future economic assistance to the Government of Iraq on significant progress toward achievement of benchmarks  Allows exceptions for humanitarian  security  and job creation assistance    Regional Diplomacy  Launches a comprehensive regional and international diplomatic initiative   that includes key nations in the region   to help achieve a political settlement among the Iraqi people  end the civil war in Iraq  and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and regional conflict  Recommends the President should appoint a Special Envoy for Iraq to carry out this diplomacy within 60 days  Mandates that the President submit a plan to prevent the war in Iraq from becoming a wider regional conflict                                      ,Obama
