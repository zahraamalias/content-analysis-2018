"Tue, December 12, 2017",Anies unaware of lunch meeting with mass organizations,"Members of several mass organizations went to City Hall on Tuesday to meet Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan, claiming they had been invited to join him for lunch. Islam Defenders Front (FPI) member Irfan Fauzi, who was part of the group, said FPI had received a lunch invitation from the governor that was scheduled for 12 p.m. at City Hall. However, as the men waited in front of Balai Agung (Great Hall), they were approached by Eliazar Hutapea, head of the mass organization division at the city’s agency for the National and Political Unity Office (Kesbangpol), who informed them the lunch meeting was canceled and would be rescheduled as Anies had been invited to meet President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo. “We had informed them of the cancellation earlier, but the members were disappointed with the explanation,” Eliazer said. Meanwhile, Abdul Majid and his entourage from FPI left City Hall while Eliazer was explaining the reason for the cancellation. Also seen at City Hall were members of the Betawi People's Communication Forum (Forkabi), Trikora and Berkarya Party. Mass organizations were believed to have played a significant role in helping Anies win the gubernatorial election in April. Separately, Anies said he was unaware of the scheduled lunch on Tuesday. “I’ll check it later; I just learned about it,” he told reporters. Anies later said the lunch meeting had been rescheduled to Wednesday evening.

"Fri, December 1, 2017","Rizieq Shihab to attend 212 reunion rally, lawyer says","Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab, who is on the police's wanted list for allegedly violating the Pornography Law, has planned to attend a 212 reunion rally on Saturday, his lawyer said. The event, named after the date on which it took place, is to commemorate last year's rally on Dec. 2, which demanded the resignation of then-Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama. ""Habib Rizieq will be present physically,"" Rizieq's lawyer, Kapitra Ampera, said on Friday as quoted by kompas.com . Kapitra, however, refused to elaborate on the exact arrival time of the firebrand cleric, who is believed to have been in Saudi Arabia since May, when he was named a suspect. FPI spokesperson Slamet Ma'arif could not confirm whether Rizieq would attend the event, which is planned to take place in Istiqlal Mosque and at National Monument (Monas) in Central Jakarta. Rizieq was named a suspect after alleged steamy WhatsApp chats with a woman named Firza Husein, also a suspect in the case, went viral on the internet. He was named a suspect without undergoing questioning as he had evaded two summons from the police.

Rizieq is expected to attend the ""212 Rally Alumni"" anniversary event at the National Monument on Dec. 2. The event is to mark the Dec. 2, 2016 rally, which included members of the FPI and pushed for the prosecution of then governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian of Chinese descent, on blasphemy charges.

""Yes, personnel will later be [stationed] at Soekarno-Hatta airport."" Argo could not confirm whether the team would arrest Rizieq immediately upon arrival. Rizieq's lawyer, Kapitra Ampera, had announced earlier that his client would return to Indonesia soon, following a stay of several months in Saudi Arabia after he was named a suspect in a pornography case. Rizieq left the country in May, not long after police named him a suspect over the dissemination of sexually explicit WhatsApp messages in an alleged chat between him and Firza Hussein. Firza was also named a suspect in the case.

Speaking at an event to celebrate the FPI's 19th anniversary on Saturday, Anies also urged the organization to improve its image. ""I want to reiterate what I have said before, that from now on the FPI must prove itself as one of the organizations that serve as guardians of the country's diversity,"" Anies said in his speech, as quoted by tempo.co. In his speech, Anies also called on the FPI to help solve the problem of inequity and injustice in society. The former education minister said injustice could create problems that threaten national unity. ""We should not only make efforts to preserve the country's unity, but also fight for social justice for all people in Indonesia,"" Anies said. Anies delivered his speech after joining a predawn Subuh prayer with leaders and activists of the Muslim organization. FPI leader Rizieq Shihab, who is in Saudi Arabia after being named a suspect in a pornography case, played a key role in the election of Anies by mobilizing Muslims in the capital to call for the prosecution of his rival in the 2017 gubernatorial election, Basuki Thahaja ""Ahok"" Purnama.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/08/20/anies-wants-fpi-to-improve-its-image.html,"anies-baswedan, FPI, Diversity, anniversary, speech, ahok",2017
"Sat, August 19, 2017",Rizieq wants to go home after being questioned in Saudi,"Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab expects to return to Indonesia from Saudi Arabia following the move by the National Police to question him in relation to a pornography case in the Middle Eastern kingdom. Rizieq's lawyer, Kapitra Ampera, said after the questioning, which took place at the Indonesian Embassy in Jeddah, the FPI leader showed confidence that there would be a breakthrough in his case. ""He expects to have legal certainty, so that he can go back to Indonesia,"" he said as quoted by tempo.co. Kapitra said with all the information he gave to police investigators during the interview, Rizieq was confident that it would be enough to overturn the allegation against him. Rizieq was named a suspect in the pornography case following the spread of sexually explicit WhatsApp chats allegedly between him and Firza Hussein, who has also been named a suspect in the case. Rizieq, who played a key role in street protests that called for the prosecution of former Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja ""Ahok"" Purnama for blasphemy, was put on the police's most-wanted list after he fled to Saudi Arabia in late May.

Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen.

"Wed, June 7, 2017",Komnas HAM to investigate vigilantism by hard-line groups,"The National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) is set to investigate the widespread vigilantism allegedly committed by hard-line groups in Indonesia to determine whether it leads to persecution of minorities. Komnas HAM commissioner Roichatul Aswidah said to decide if the ongoing vigilantism could be categorized as persecution, the commission would use two basic instruments. First, she said, Komnas would determine whether the acts perpetrated by the hard-line groups occurred “systematically” and, second, it would examine whether those acts were “escalating.” “Acts will be categorized as persecution and a violation of human rights if they are carried out systematically and are escalating. Yet, if they do not take place systematically and are not escalating, they can [only] be categorized as general crimes, which can lead to charges under the KUHP [Criminal Code],” she said. Roichatul said perpetrators committing general crimes could be charged under KUHP Article 351 concerning assault and Article 170 concerning violence toward human beings and goods . “Komnas HAM will take a closer look to determine if the acts have been done systematically and are escalating.” Recently, a 15-year-old boy of Chinese descent in East Jakarta was verbally and physically abused by a mob of Islam Defenders Front (FPI) followers because they thought his humorous social media memes insulted their leader, Rizieq Shihab. Similarly, a female Muslim physician in Solok, West Sumatra, was confronted by FPI members who demanded she delete criticisms concerning Rizieq's questionable morals from her social media account.

Police recently named two men in East Jakarta suspects for verbally and physically abusing a 15-year-old boy of Chinese descent whom they accused of having insulted Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab with humorous memes on his social media account.

Therefore, we condemn individuals or organizations taking arbitrary measures [that harm freedom of expression],” Nur said. Meanwhile, Komnas HAM commissioner M. Imdadun  Rahmat said cases of vigilantism were processed under the Criminal Code (KUHP) and the commission would supervise and make sure that the police worked under proper procedures when tackling the cases.

"Tue, June 6, 2017","Lawyers support police's fight against radicalism, intolerance","A group of lawyers attached to the Pancasila Defenders Forum of Advocates (FAPP) have declared their support for the National Police in their fight against radicalism and intolerance. FAPP chairman Teguh Samudra said the support derived from their concerns over the increasing cases of intolerance and intimidation against minority groups, which could threaten Indonesia’s unity. “We support the police in their fight against radicalism and intolerance. Police should not be afraid of being accused of criminalizing ulemas. We believe what the police have done [so far] is in line with the law,” Teguh told journalists after extending the forum’s official support to the police on Monday. National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian expressed his thanks for the support, saying it would make the police stronger in combating radicalism and intolerance. “The police have always referred to two pillars for carrying out their actions. They are legal and societal legitimacy. Legal legitimacy means we must always follow the rule of law, while societal legitimacy requires support from the people,” Tito said. Vigilantism has recently occupied media headlines following a pornography case allegedly involving Islam Defenders Front (FPI) chairman Rizieq Shihab. The police named Rizieq a pornography suspect on Monday last week. In the following days, the police issued an arrest warrant for Rizieq, who skipped a police summons and is reportedly seeking shelter in Saudi Arabia. FPI members accused the police of criminalizing ulemas for naming Rizieq a suspect and ordering his arrest.

"Tue, June 6, 2017",MUI issues how-to guide to make social media great again,"With social media increasingly turning into a platform for hate and bigotry, the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) on Monday issued a guide for Muslims in the country on how to responsibly use the medium. In the 20-page guide, which takes the form of a fatwa (edict), the MUI forbade Muslims from spreading hate speech, slanderous statements, hoaxes, pornographic material and racial slurs, which it deemed haram (forbidden under Islamic law). “While communicating on social media, Muslims must consider the action as part of efforts to promote iman [faith] and ketakwaan [piety] instead of kufur [infidelity] and maksiat [sin],” the MUI said. The body also declared in the edict that it was also haram for Muslims to take the job of a social media “buzzer” whose work is to distribute hoaxes, slanderous accusations and fake news for personal economic gain. “We also proscribe Muslims from [...] supporting and taking advantage of the profession of social media buzzer,” the edict said. MUI chairman Ma’ruf Amin officially handed over the fatwa to Communications and Information Minister Rudiantara in a ceremony on Monday and expressed hope that the guideline could be used as reference for a cybersecurity team at the ministry to prosecute any offenders. Ma’ruf said that although the edict was nonbinding, he expected Muslims in Indonesia to abide by it. The MUI chairman said that the council took the initiative after getting complaints that the effects of fake news and hate speech on social media had worsened in recent months. “The problems of social media have become so serious that President Jokowi made repeated calls for people to stop themselves from spreading hate speech on social media. This is why the MUI stepped in to provide a solution for the nation,” Ma’ruf said. Ma’ruf also said that the MUI decided to take action following reports of a surge in cases of vigilantism, which involved social media users being targeted by hard-line Muslim organizations for allegedly posting statements deemed slanderous to Islam or Muslim clerics. Last week, Fiera Lovita, 40, a physician at Solok Regional Hospital, received police protection after being harassed by members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) after she posted statements on Facebook criticizing FPI leader Rizieq Shihab for fleeing the country after being named a suspect in a pornography case. Also last week, a 15-year-old boy of Chinese descent in Cipi- nang Muara, East Jakarta, was subjected to intimidation and violence by alleged supporters of the FPI after posting statements on Facebook that could be interpreted as making fun of Rizieq. Responding to the MUI’s move, Rudiantara said that the fatwa could encourage the ministry to step up its monitoring of incendiary rhetoric on social media. “This is a breath of fresh air for us at the ministry. This could support our work in containing the spread of negative content and hate speech on the internet. The fatwa will be used as a reference for our team, which also has a representative at the MUI, to determine whether to block something on the internet,” Rudiantara said. Rudiantara said the ministry would also work with the National Police to bring criminal charges against netizens who spread hatred and slander on social media.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/06/06/mui-issues-how-to-guide-to-make-social-media-great-again.html,"social-media, MUI, Muslims, Rizieq-Shihab, Communications-and-Information-Ministry, Rudiantara, FPI, Fiera-Lovita, cybersecurity, cyber-security, fake-news, hate-speech",2017
"Mon, June 5, 2017",Cops act against surging vigilantism,"The National Police have made several bold moves following a strongly worded call from President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo over the weekend imploring the police to take action against radical groups carrying out vigilante violence. After two men in East Jakarta were named suspects for intimidating, a 15-year-old boy of Chinese descent who was accused of insulting Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab, National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian dismissed the police chief of Solok, West Sumatra, Adj. Sr. Comr. Susmelawati Rosya, from her position for failing to sufficiently protect Fiera Lovita, 40, a physician who has been targeted by members of the hard-line group in the city. Fiera was reportedly intimidated by the FPI after making social media comments that members of the group considered defamation of Rizeiq. On May 19 and May 21, Fiera published Facebook posts criticizing Rizieq for traveling to Saudi Arabia to avoid his legal problems. Rizieq is currently facing pornography charges after screenshots of a lascivious Whatsapp conversation, allegedly between him and a woman, went viral on social media. He claims the case against him is politically motivated. On May 23, local FPI members, escorted by officers from the Solok Police, confronted Fiera at her workplace, asking her to delete her Facebook posts and release a written statement declaring her regret and retracting her claims. National Police spokesperson Insp. Gen. Setyo Wasisto said the Solok Police chief had failed to properly protect Fiera. “The [National] Police chief felt Bu Rosya did not fully perform her duty. She only facilitated a mediation without investigating the intimidation,” he said. Setyo said the police needed to send a strong signal given that the latest case of vigilantism had created fear in many communities. Prior to removing the Solok Police chief, Tito ordered a thorough investigation of a similar case in East Jakarta. Tito earlier said that he would dismiss any of his subordinates who failed to take action against vigilante groups. Last week, several men claiming to be members of the FPI confronted a 15-year-old boy in Cipinang Muara, East Jakarta, after he posted a statement on Facebook that they claimed slandered Rizieq. In a viral video of the incident the boy is seen surrounded by the men, who are harassing him and threatening him with severe violence. The group then coerce the boy into signing a written a statement apologizing to Rizieq. The East Jakarta Police have arrested two people who allegedly took part in the incident. One of the suspects is reportedly a member of the local branch of the FPI while the other is a local man who is thought to be seen in the video slapping the boy’s face two times. The two suspects in the case, AM and M have been charged under Article 80 of Law No. 35/2014 on child protection, which carries a maximum prison sentence of three years and six months. Other than the two suspects, East Jakarta Police officers have also questioned five witnesses as part of the case. Rights groups have said the viral East Jakarta video was part of a systematic campaign by hardline Islamist groups to intimidate social media users who, in their opinion, insult Islam and Muslim clerics. Data from the Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network (SAFEnet) show that the intimidation campaign started in January, but the number of cases spiked after non-active Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Thahaja Purnama was found guilty of blasphemy on May 9. SAFEnet recorded 59 cases of intimidation against individuals accused of insulting Islam and clerics between January and May, with the majority occurring in May. On Saturday President Jokowi expressed grave concern over the rising vigilante violence, warning that it could turn Indonesia into a “barbaric” country. In a speech delivered at Malang Muhammadiyah University in East Java, Jokowi said vigilante justice was against the law and that no individuals, groups or organizations could take the law into their own hands. “We should not allow this to happen. We could turn into a barbaric nation if we fail to stop it,” Jokowi said in his speech. Jokowi said he had instructed National Police chief Tito, to crack down on vigilantism both online and offline. “We should believe in our law enforcement agencies. Let them handle the problems,” he said.

"Sat, June 3, 2017",Tito replaces Solok Police chief over persecution,"National Police spokesperson Insp. Gen. Setyo Wasisto said on Saturday that National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian had replaced Solok, West Sumatra, Police chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Susmelawati Rosya, over her inability to prevent the persecution of Fiera Lovita, 40, a physician at Solok Regional Hospital, by Islam Defenders Front (FPI) members. Setyo said Rosya was deemed to have been incapable of properly protecting Fiera. The police chief had mediated a dialogue between Fiera and FPI members who had intimidated her but it did not solve the problem, he added. It was previously reported that Fiera had been intimidated by FPI members who accused her of defaming their leader Rizieq Shihab on her Facebook account last week. (Read also: Police warns against online witch hunts ) Setyo said Rosya did not carry out the law-enforcement responsibility she bore as a police chief against the parties intimidating Fiera. “Our leader [Tito] felt Bu Rosya did not fully perform her duty as a public servant. She only facilitated the mediation without investigating the intimidation,” he said. Setyo further said the persecution had caused fear that spread to several regions. On Friday evening, Tito said he would not hesitate to replace any subordinate who was not firm in handling persecution cases. An internal telegram signed and released by Arief Sulistyanto, of the National Police chief’s management staff, on Friday revealed that Rosya was transferred to the human resources bureau of the West Sumatra Police.

Recently, a 15-year-old male teenager of Chinese descent was reportedly forced by FPI members to sign an apology letter for having allegedly insulted Rizieq on his Facebook account. “[...] We will still report him to law enforcement authorities so that there will be a deterrent effect on those [wanting to] insult Islam and clerics,” Slamet told The Jakarta Post on Thursday. According to reports, a group of FPI members and local residents mobbed and intimidated the 15-year-old boy after he insulted Rizieq Shihab on Facebook. (Read also: Video shows 15-year-old boy harassed for allegedly insulting FPI leader ) Video footage that went viral on social media indicate that the boy was forced to sign a stamped statement of apology. In the video, the boy also appears to be repeatedly hit by a man. “You’d better tell your friends of your [Chinese] ethnicity not to do it anymore, so this will not happen again,” said one FPI member. “You have to know that Habib Rizieq belongs not only to the FPI but also to all Muslims. The FPI is just an organization but he [Rizieq] is loved by millions of people in Indonesia.” Slamet said the FPI would not allow Islam and clerics to be insulted by anyone and rejected the notion that the boy's online post was in line with freedom of expression.

In the video, a group of people can be seen coercing the boy, who is of Chinese descent, to sign a statement of apology for slandering Rizieq, who was recently named a suspect in a pornography case. The boy’s hands were shaking when he was holding the paper. “You better tell your friends of your ethnicity to never do it again, so this will not happen again,” one of the men said in the video. The man tells the teenager that Rizieq is respected not only by FPI members but also by the whole Muslim community. Another man is later seen slapping the boy's mouth two times. Damar Juniarto, the regional coordinator for the Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network, said the incident took place in East Jakarta and was clearly part of a growing trend of persecution of social media users by the hard-line Islamist group. FPI spokesman Slamet Maarif said he was not aware of the incident, adding that the FPI leadership had ordered group members to report those who insulted Islam and Muslim clerics to the police.

In the video, dozens of members of the FPI's South Jakarta chapter were seen carrying weapons, including sharpened bamboo sticks, to use, they initially claimed on camera to police, to stop violent motorcycle gangsters from roaming in the city. The video has been shared on some social media platforms and has gained considerable public attention. Winam said that the special team formed to deal with gangs had frequently carried out similar measures to disperse groups or organizations that could potentially create unease among citizens through their vigilantism. “That’s indeed part of our duty, but maybe the public was unaware of it until the FPI video went viral. We previously carried out the same measures against the PP [Pancasila Youth],” Winam said on Monday as quoted by kompas.com .

"Tue, May 30, 2017",Police should thank us for ‘educating’ people who insult Muslims: FPI,"The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) has claimed the Internet sweeping conducted by several FPI members to hunt down social media users allegedly insulting its leader, Rizieq Shihab, was an initiative of members in several regions, not an official program of the organization. However, as an organization, FPI fully supports the initiative because it is in line with the organization’s vision, which aims to avoid conflict among religious followers that can create dissension in Indonesia. “Police should thank us for educating irresponsible people who have insulted ulemas and defamed religions,” FPI spokesperson Slamet Maarif told The Jakarta Post on Monday. The most recent online prosecution allegedly committed by FPI was directed toward a female physician, Fiera Lovita, 40, from Solok Regional Hospital in Padang, West Sumatra. The FPI accused her of insulting Rizieq by posting comments on her Facebook account about his alleged involvement in a pornography case. Several FPI members confronted Fiera at her workplace on May 23, pressuring her to delete her comments and write an official letter saying she regretted her actions. “For a deterrent effect we want the police to arrest and take a legal action against her,” Slamet said.

"Tue, May 30, 2017",Police name FPI leader suspect in porn case,"The Jakarta Police have named Rizieq Shihab, the firebrand cleric and leader of hard-line Muslim organization Islam Defenders Front (FPI), a suspect in a pornography case. Rizieq was named a suspect on Monday without having undergone police questioning in his previous capacity as a witness as he had failed to answer a police summons in April and May. “At 12 a.m. today [Monday], investigators at the Jakarta Police’s special crimes unit increased Rizieq’s status from witness to suspect,” said Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Argo Yuwono. “We have sent his dossier to the Jakarta Prosecutors’ Office.” Argo Yuwono said investigators from the Jakarta Police special crimes unit had gathered adequate evidence to increase Rizieq’s status to that of suspect. “He will be charged under articles 4, 6 and 8 of the 2008 Pornography Law,” he said. The case first surfaced late January when a now-blocked website, baladacintarizieq.com , uploaded screenshots of WhatsApp chats that allegedly took place between Rizieq and Firza Husein. The chats are filled with profanity and nude pictures allegedly of Firza, who preceded Rizieq to be named a suspect in the same case on May 16. The police sent a first summons to Rizieq on April 25 along with Firza, Rizieq’s wife and a friend of Firza’s, whose name is mentioned in the steamy chats. However, none of them showed up for various reasons. Rizieq also evaded the second questioning session on May 10 as he was abroad and his exact location was unknown even to his lawyer, Sugito Atmo Pawiro. Rizieq is currently in Saudi Arabia. When and if he comes home, the pornography case is not the only lawsuit that he is going to face. On Jan. 30, the West Java Police also named him a suspect for allegedly insulting the Pancasila, the state ideology. “In Sukarno’s Pancasila, faith in God is placed in the ass, but in Jakarta Charter’s Pancasila, faith in God is placed in the head. Which one is better?” Rizieq says in a video that went viral online and was later reported to the police by Sukmawati Soekarnoputri, a daughter of former president Sukarno, in October 2016 to the West Java Police. He was charged with Article 154a of the Criminal Code (KUHP) on insulting state symbols and Article 320 for defaming a dead person. The charges carry a maximum penalty of four years and four months in prison, respectively. Since his pornography case came out, Rizieq has always insisted that the profane chats were made up. He also kept pointing to the police’s reluctance to pursue the uploader of the steamy chats, which led to the pornography charges against him and Firza. Through Sugito, Rizieq released a written statement on May 16, saying that he would only fulfill his duty as a law-abiding citizen once the police had caught the “perpetrator of the mean slander via WhatsApp.” Sugito reaffirmed Rizieq’s stance once again on Monday when The Jakarta Post sought confirmation about the latter’s status of suspect. Sugito lamented that the police had not made an effort to pursue the uploader of the chats. “The investigators are being unfair and forcing their will [upon Rizieq]. Habib [Rizieq] has not even been questioned yet. They have gone too far,” said Sugito.

The FPI accused her of insulting Rizieq by posting comments on her Facebook account about the firebrand cleric, who is now a suspect in a pornography case and has failed to appear for police questioning on several occasions. The FPI members confronted Fiera at her workplace on May 23, pressuring her to delete her comments and write an official letter saying she regretted her actions. “They do not have the authority to force anyone,” Setyo said, “If they felt offended [by comments], they could report the person to the police.” “Vigilantism can turn people into suspects,” Setyo added.

"Mon, May 29, 2017",AJI lambasts FPI's online persecution,"The Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) has lambasted all forms of intimidation, violence and attempts to restrict freedom of speech by the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). The FPI has committed terrorism by persecuting citizens accused of producing defamatory statements against the organization’s leader, Rizieq Shihab, on social media, forcing them to apologize under threat, says AJI. “Such terror acts must not be allowed,” AJI leader Suwarjono said in a statement. “The arbitrary persecution by the FPI has violated the 1945 Constitution, which promotes and guarantees civilians’ right to assemble as well as to freely state opinions”. The FPI has been targeting anyone who posts statements deemed insulting toward Islam and Islamic figures for the last two weeks. The actions began following the conviction of non-active Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama in a blasphemy case. Members of the organization, for example, intimidated 38-year-old female entrepreneur Indrie Soraya in Tangerang, Banten, and 40-year old physician Fiera Lovita in Solok, West Sumatra for insulting Rizieq. The two could be charged under Article 28 on defamation of the Electronic Information and Transactions (ITE) Law, according to the Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network (SAFEnet). To uphold the right to freedom of the speech, AJI has thus called on the National Police to take immediate action against the FPI’s arbitrary online persecution. (msa/wit)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/29/aji-lambasts-fpis-online-persecution.html,"FPI, AJI",2017
"Wed, May 17, 2017",Rizieq refuses to celebrate Idul Fitri behind bars,"Hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab has been known as the loudest advocate in pushing for blasphemy charges against non-active Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama. Since late last year, the firebrand cleric has led a series of anti-Ahok rallies in the capital as he repeatedly called for the authorities to bring Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent, “to justice” for “insulting Islam.” Amid mob pressure, police and prosecutors swiftly completed Ahok’s dossier. As rallies were held by conservative Muslim groups last week, Ahok was sentenced to two years in prison for blasphemy by the North Jakarta District Court, only two weeks after Ahok lost his reelection bid amid an intense sectarian campaign. While Ahok is in detention, Rizieq, who happens to be implicated in a number of criminal cases, has failed to prove he is a lawabiding citizen, prompting harsh criticism and cynicism given the cleric’s tireless calls for the “rule of law” against Ahok. West Java Police have named Rizieq a suspect for allegedly insulting the Pancasila state ideology and the memory of Indonesia’s first president, Sukarno. He is also under investigation at the Jakarta Police in a pornography case allegedly involving him and treason suspect Firza Husein. Has has also been reported to the police in a number of cases centering on blasphemy, slander and incitement of hatred. The FPI leader failed to fulfill two summons issued by the Jakarta Police in his capacity as a witness in the pornography case on April 25 and May 10. “He is in Jeddah [Saudi Arabia],” Jakarta Police spokesperson Sr. Comr. Argo Yuwono said on Tuesday. The police said they planned to forcefully retrieve Rizieq with the help of Interpol. However, as of Tuesday, the Jakarta Police had yet to decide whether they would send a team to pick him up. “It will be the investigators’ decision because [Rizieq’s] status is still that of a witness,” Argo said, adding that the police would also coordinate with the Directorate General of Immigration at the Law and Human Rights Ministry. Rizieq’s lawyer, Kapitra Ampera, said the FPI leader had left the country, having claimed innocence. Kapitra said Rizieq went on a umrah (minor haj) with his family on April 27. The cleric continued his journey to Yemen and then Malaysia before he returned to Saudi Arabia. Kapitra said his client would not fulfill any summonses in the near future because Rizieq would likely spend Ramadhan in Mecca. He may only return to Indonesia after Idul Fitri, Kapitra added. Rizieq initially wanted to return to Indonesia last Saturday, but he decided otherwise, Kapitra said. One of the reasons was because the FPI leader had been summoned by the police over a case that “he does not understand,” the lawyer said. “[The case] has nothing to do with him. It’s even possible that the case has been orchestrated,” Kapitra said as quoted by Antara. Separately, National Police spokesperson Sr. Comr. Martinus Sitompul urged Rizieq to respect legal procedures and return to Indonesia. He said a warrant had been issued because he failed to show up twice for questioning as a witness. Jakarta Police announced last week that they would detain Rizieq as soon as he returned to Indonesia. “We have talked with [Rizieq’s] lawyer several times [regarding the matter]. We want him to fulfill his obligation as a citizen and comply with the law,” Martinus said. Directorate General of Immigration spokesperson Agung Sampurno said the decision to retrieve Rizieq by force from Saudi Arabia fell under the domain of the National Police, which coordinated with Interpol. “The immigration office cannot interfere with the process, because it’s a general criminal case,” Agung told The Jakarta Post. He further said the immigration office did not have knowledge of the type of visa Rizieq had used in making multiple visits to Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, the West Java Prosecutor’s Office has returned the dossier on Rizieq in the case pertaining to the Pancasila and Sukarno to investigators at the West Java Police. Prosecutor’s office head Setia Untung Arimuladi said there were formal and material requirements police investigators needed to complete before the dossier could be declared complete and handed over to the court. “There are 10 items that need to be refined in the formal requirements, while there are nine items for the material requirements,” Untung said in Bandung.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/17/rizieq-refuses-to-celebrate-idul-fitri-behind-bars.html,FPI,2017
"Wed, May 17, 2017",Jokowi scrambles to ease tension,"President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, who barely took a break following an overseas trip, scrambled on Tuesday to contain sectarian tension that escalated following a court decision to imprison non-active Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama for blasphemy. Soon after he arrived at the State Palace from his trip to Palu, Central Sulawesi, his last stopover after a two-day visit to Beijing, he did not even have time to change his suit before going into another meeting to discuss efforts to de-escalate the growing tension. The meeting, which was hastily arranged at the State Palace, took place between Jokowi and representatives from the country’s key religious organizations. Joining the religious leaders were National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian and Indonesian Military (TNI) commander Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo, who Jokowi instructed to crack down on individuals or parties responsible for spreading hate speech that could aggravate the tension. The President was reported to have been growing anxious amid the worsening sectarian tension while attending China’s One Belt One Road (OBOR) conference in Beijing, and on Monday he ordered the State Secretariat to convene a meeting involving leaders of Muslim, Protestant, Catholic, Buddhist, Hindu and Confucian communities at the State Palace. During the one-hour meeting, the religious leaders expressed their commitment to help ease the tension and pledged to champion the country’s unity. “We talked about the latest dynamics that have grown more concerning. I’m happy to hear commitment from religious leaders and their followers to defend the unity of the country and Pancasila, as well as the 1945 Constitution in the spirit of Bhinneka Tunggal Ika [Unity in Diversity],” Jokowi told reporters at a press conference after the meeting. Jokowi also urged people to not stage street protests and that he would get tough on individuals or groups who posed a threat to the country’s unity. “I have ordered leaders of the National Police and TNI to not hesitate to arrest those responsible for making any verbal statements or actions that could harm the country and the principle of Bhinneka Tunggal Ika,” Jokowi said. Monday was the first time Jokowi issued a public statement to address the sectarian tension, which escalated following the decision of the North Jakarta District Court to sentence Ahok to two years in prison for insulting the Quran. The verdict on Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent, caused division among those who believed the non-active Jakarta governor was innocent and Muslim groups convinced the outspoken politician had denigrated Islam. In Makassar, South Sulawesi, hundreds of people gathered for a candlelight vigil in support of Ahok before being attacked by conservative Muslim groups. In West Kalimantan, the local Dayak community pledged that it would bar the entry of leaders of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Members of the community were motivated by a speech from West Kalimantan Governor Cornelis, who pledged he would kick out FPI leader Rizieq Shihab from the province. Two FPI leaders were forced last week to return to Jakarta only 30 minutes after landing at Supadio International Airport. Also last week, hundreds of people in the predominantly Christian Manado, North Sulawesi, swarmed Sam Ratulangi International Airport and the governor’s office to protest a visit from House of Representatives Deputy Speaker Fahri Hamzah, a politician from the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), who has been vocal in calling for the prosecution of Ahok. On Tuesday, the religious leaders invited to the meeting included individuals from the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), the country’s largest and secondlargest Muslim organizations, Nahdhlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah, the Bishops Council of Indonesia (KWI), the Indonesian Communion of Churches (PGI), the Council of Buddhist Communities (Walubi), Indonesian Hindu Religious Council (PHDI) and the Confucian Supreme Council of Indonesia (Matakin). Responding to Jokowi’s call, MUI chairman Makruf Amin said religious leaders would intensify interfaith dialogue to prevent any efforts to divide the country. “We will intensify dialogue in society and strengthen the nation’s unity,” Makruf said. The rector of Muhammadiyah University in Jakarta Syaiful Bakhri, who represented Muhammadiyah during the meeting, praised Jokowi for convening the meeting. “There are concerns about disintegration. This dialogue must continue to strengthen the unity of the country and affirm Pancasila as the country’s ideology,” Syaiful said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/17/jokowi-scrambles-to-ease-tension.html,Jokowi,2017

The four-kilometer long march from Papua Regional Representatives (DPRD) to the governor’s office on Monday, which was coordinated by Ecumenical Council of Churches in Papua (PGGP), also demanded the dissolution of Islamic hard-line group Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and the arrest of FPI leader Rizieq Shihab. PGGP chairman, Catholic bishop Leo Laba Ladjar stated that radicalism in Indonesia had reached an alarming level. “We believe the radical movements trouble our security and nationhood. We are becoming polarized,” he stated. Many believe that the North Jakarta District Court’s decision to sentence Ahok to two years’ imprisonment for blasphemy on May 9 was the result of pressure from hardline groups. Addressing the rally at his office, Papua deputy governor Klemen Tinal said “the rally’s aspiration is to remind us that we live in the NKRI [Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia] under Pancasila and the UUD 45 Constitution.” Every evening since May 10, Jayapura residents have held a candle light vigil at Imbi park to support Ahok.

"Mon, May 15, 2017",Ahok ruling raises tension,"The highly divisive blasphemy conviction against non-active Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama has sparked tensions in some regions, with supporters of the Christian governor upping the ante against the Islamist group that has been calling for his incarceration. The situation in West Kalimantan, which saw hundreds of people killed in two bloody ethnic conflicts in 1996/1997 and 2001, is particularly worrying as rising sectarian tensions in the capital have reignited suspicions among different religious and ethnic groups in the province. Mercelina Erni, 46, a Christian resident in the province’s capital Pontianak said she had heard rumors, mainly from social media, that raids were imminent against Dayak people and Christians. “I had to take down the rosary I used to hang on the rearview mirror of my car when I heard the rumors,” she told The Jakarta Post on Sunday. The rumors were triggered by a speech made by West Kalimantan Governor Cornelis, in which he said he would oppose the presence of Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab, a vocal antiAhok figure, in the province. The Dayak people, one of West Kalimantan’s largest ethnic groups, have expressed their support for the governor’s stance. On Friday, two FPI leaders, Sobri Lubis and Hidayat Quaiandri Batangtaris, who came to Pontianak to inaugurate members of a local FPI branch, were forced to return to Jakarta only 30 minutes after landing at Supadio International Airport. Authorities said they asked the two FPI leaders to return because of security concerns. The incident has angered a group of people claiming to represent Malays and Muslims. They called on authorities to prosecute the governor for stoking sectarian tensions. Meanwhile, rumors are also rife that some Malay and Muslim groups plan to disrupt an annual cultural event to be held by Dayak people in the city on May 20. Leaders of Dayak and Malay communities have met to respond to the rumors and called on the public to remain calm. The Pontianak Police have also beefed up security in the city and gave an assurance that authorities would act professionally in handling possible clashes. “We have prepared 4,000 personnel from the police force and the Indonesian Military to maintain security. We will take action against anyone who tries to disrupt security, ” said Pontianak Police Chief Sr. Comr. Iwan Imam Susilo. Dayak people account for around 35 percent of West Kalimantan’s population, followed by the Malay (34 percent), Javanese (10 percent) and Chinese (8 percent). Sixty percent of the province’s population is Muslim, while 34 percent is Christian. In predominantly Christian Manado, North Sulawesi, hundreds of people on Saturday swarmed Sam Ratulangi International Airport and the governor’s office to protest againts the presence of House of Representatives deputy speaker Fahri Hamzah, who was accused of supporting the FPI. The protests came just three days after thousands gathered in the city for a candlelight vigil supporting Ahok, who is now detained after being sentenced to two years for citing a Quranic verse in a speech deemed as blasphemous. “Fahri Hamzah is not a tolerant person. That is why we reject his presence here,” said Brian Maloor, chairman of a local group that participated in the Sam Ratulangi rally. Fahri had to be evacuated by the police after spending only six hours in the city. In other regions, the FPI has been more daring in carrying out their actions. In Makassar, South Sulawesi, dozens of alleged FPI members attempted to disperse a group holding a candlelight vigil for Ahok. Salim Said, a senior political and security analyst, expressed concerns about the rising sectarian tensions, which he believed could threaten the country’s diversity. He called on the country’s leaders in Jakarta to be fully aware of the situation to prevent horizontal conflicts. Meanwhile, Indonesian diasporas in major cities abroad have held rallies to support Ahok and Indonesian diversity, including in Amsterdam, Auckland, Los Angeles, New York, Perth, Sydney, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto and Vancouver.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/15/ahok-ruling-raises-tension.html,"basuki-tjahaja-purnama, blasphemy, sectarian-issues",2017

FPI leader Rizieq Shihab was reported by the Indonesian Catholic Students Association (PMKRI) and Students Peace Institute (SPI) to the Jakarta Police in December after a video of a sermon he gave was uploaded onto Twitter and Instagram. In the 22-second video, Rizieq is heard saying: “If God gave birth, then who would be the midwife?” Meanwhile, his confidante, FPI spokesman Munarman, was named a suspect in February by Bali Police for allegedly insulting pecalang (traditional Balinese security guards). National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Rikwanto said investigations into both cases were ongoing. He denied Ahok’s case had been given extra attention. “Everyone is equal before the law,” he told journalists at the National Police headquarters on Tuesday. Ahok was declared guilty for blasphemy and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment by a panel of judges at the North Jakarta District Court on Tuesday.

"Thu, May 4, 2017",Jakartans call for help against radicalism,"As Jakartans are still reeling from the most divisive gubernatorial election the city has ever seen, which exacerbated sectarianism and fanned anti-Chinese sentiments, some citizens have called on the government to protect the capital from any threat from radicals. On Wednesday the State Palace, as well as the headquarters of the National Police, the Jakarta Police and the Indonesian Military (TNI), were adorned with dozens of flower boards bearing messages calling on the government to curb radicalism. “We are ready to support the military and the police to eradicate radicalism and maintain the unity of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia [NKRI],” read one flower board that had been put on the front yard of the Jakarta Police headquarters in Senayan, South Jakarta. “Save the NKRI, curb radicalism,” read another flower board. The two flower boards were among more than 20 flower arrangements set up at the police’s headquarters. “To be honest, we have no idea who put all these flowers here,” said Jakarta Police spokesperson Sr. Comr. Argo Yuwono on Wednesday. He appreciated the act and deemed it to be part of the nation’s democracy. “Certainly, this is a form of citizens showing their aspirations. They address their appreciation and motivations toward the police. They will encourage us to continue safeguarding Jakarta,” Argo said. Flower boards were also sent to the State Palace as a token of gratitude to President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo for his role in maintaining Pancasila as the state ideology. The senders, however, also pointed out that the police and the military were still an important part of guarding Jakarta from the threat of disunity and radicalism. The gesture came a few weeks after the Jakarta runoff election, described by experts as the country’s most polarizing election with racial and religious issues overshadowing the city’s most critical problems, including education and infrastructure. Riding a growing wave of religious conservatism, former culture and education minister Anies Baswedan won the election, beating incumbent Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, who was dogged by allegations he had committed blasphemy while seeking election. Some political experts said Anies owed his success in the runoff election to Muslim voters who decided to throw their support behind him, mobilized by Muslim groups, including the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Following Ahok’s loss in the election, thousands of people showed their support for the governor by turning City Hall into a jungle of colorful flower boards last week. Admirers sent flower boards to express their sympathy, sadness, or support for Ahok and Deputy Governor Djarot Saiful Hidayat, who conceded defeat in the April 19 election ahead of the official announcement of the results. A political analyst from Indo Barometer, M. Qodari, said that the flowers sent to the military and the police headquarters were a clear sign that there were some Jakarta residents who were worried about the impact of the election. Qodari described the flowers as a “cry for help” from Jakarta residents, besides being a token of gratitude to law enforcement officers. “Some people are worried that recently conservative groups have gotten a bigger stage and have taken control of the public sphere,” he told The Jakarta Post. “Therefore, they ask for help from the police and the military.” Messages on other flower arrangements called for the police to arrest FPI leader Rizieq Shihab and to disband his organization. Responding to the messages, Argo said, “There is nothing wrong with sending messages through flowers. Deciding whether to say something has broken the law is up to the police.”",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/04/jakartans-call-for-help-against-radicalism.html,jakarta,2017

"Thu, April 20, 2017",Anies rides Islamist wave,"Riding a wave of growing religious conservatism, former culture and education minister Anies Baswedan won the Jakarta gubernatorial election on Wednesday, beating incumbent Basuki Thahaja “Ahok” Purnama, a political candidate dogged by allegations of blasphemy while seeking reelection. Results of quick counts conducted by a number of pollsters showed that Anies and his running mate Sandiaga Uno, nominated by the Gerindra Party and the Islam-based Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), had a comfortable lead over their rival Ahok and running mate Djarot Sjaiful Hidayat, backed by a coalition of major political parties including the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), the Golkar Party, the NasDem Party and the United Development Party (PPP). At least eight pollsters projected Anies had a double-digit lead over Ahok. Jakarta-based Pollster Sjaiful Mujani Research and Consulting (SRMC) showed that Anies got 58.06 percent of the vote, against Ahok’s 41.94. Pollster Indo Barometer tallied similar results, showing that Ahok was trailing Anies by 17 percent. Meanwhile, Charta Politika, another Jakarta-based pollster known to be close to Ahok’s camp, also projected a win for Anies, who garnered 57.87 percent of the vote, while Ahok only secured 42.13 percent. The Jakarta General Elections Commission (KPU Jakarta) is expected to announce the official result from the balloting on May 1. Pollsters’ projections showed the odds were stacked against Ahok soon after he won the first election round in February. (Read also: Anies celebrates victory with conservatives at Istiqlal Mosque ) Despite public opinion surveys projecting Anies and Ahok in a statistical dead heat, the quick-count results showed that Ahok failed to expand his base. Ahok received 42.99 percent of the vote in the first round. Anies, on the other hand, was able to bring in more votes, especially from supporters of Agus Yudhoyono Harimurti, who finished third in the first round with 17.02 percent of the vote. Anies and his running mate Sandiaga came in second in the first round with 39.95 percent of the vote. Anies’ strategy of crafting messages directed at Muslim groups has apparently paid off, with nearly all of Agus’ supporters switching over to his side. In the first round, Agus devoted more resources to woo conservative Muslim voters, while Anies made attempts to appeal to the urban, young middle-income segment. Muslims make up around 78 percent of the more than 7.2 million registered voters in the city. Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) political analyst Arya Fernandes said Anies and Sandiaga owed their success in the runoff election to Muslim voters who decided to throw their support behind the pair, mobilized by Muslim groups, including the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI). “I think Anies-Sandiaga’s victory cannot be disassociated from Muslims preferences,” Arya told The Jakarta Post on Wednesday. Part of the blame for Ahok’s defeat in the poll was the overconfidence of the parties in his coalition with their political machinery, Arya said. “Political parties in Ahok’s coalition underestimated their rivals,” Arya said. Early on Wednesday, PDI-P secretary-general Hasto Kristiyanto expressed his optimism that Ahok could win the runoff election with at least 52 percent of the vote. Soon after polls closed and pollsters began projecting a victory for Anies, Gerindra chief patron Prabowo Subianto said Anies’ victory was owed much to the role played by Muslim clerics, whom he considered as having played greater roles in the election season, even more than professional politicians. “Politicians always make too many calculations before declaring support, that’s the difference between them and kyai [Muslim cleric],” Prabowo said, to the chanting of Allahuakbar (God is Great) from those who gathered at Gerindra headquarters in Ragunan, South Jakarta, on Wednesday. Prabowo also called on his rivals to stop branding conservative clerics such as FPI leader Rizieq Shihab and Muslim People’s Forum (FUI) leader Bachtiar Nasir as radicals who wanted to commit treason. Leader of Anies’ campaign team, Mardani Ali Sera, also praised Rizieq as an “important pillar” in Anies victory against Ahok. Anies, however, said in his victory speech that he promised to begin reconciliation following a divisive and bitterly contested election. Anies said he and Sandiaga were prepared to take on the job as the leaders of a city home to people with various religious and ethnic backgrounds. “I assure you that I will be a good leader not just for our voters, or just the Muslim population. Anies and Sandiaga will serve all Jakarta residents,” he said. Anies went on to praise Ahok and Djarot as two of the country’s finest citizens. “We will continue to be friends. They are two of the best citizens who have contributed to the nation,” he said. In his concession speech, Ahok said he would work harder for the remainder of his term to pave the way for Anies’ administration. “We still have six months. We will complete all our work and fulfill our promises. We hope Pak Anies and Pak Sandi will continue what we started,” Ahok said.

"Mon, April 3, 2017",Voters fear intimidation from anti-Ahok movement,"In less than three weeks, 7 million people in the capital will have the chance to exercise their voting rights in the runoff of one of the fiercest gubernatorial elections in the city’s history. While recent elections in the capital have been largely free of conflicts, this time a large mass movement called Tamasya AlMaidah (Al-Maidah Tour) has cast lingering fear among voters, especially with hard-line group Islam Defenders Front (FPI) expected to join the movement. Named after a verse in the Quran that is often used by conservative Muslim political groups to urge Muslims to vote for political candidates of the same faith as themselves, the movement aims to deploy at least 100 volunteers to supervise 1,000 polling stations that they consider prone to foul play on election day on April 19. Al-Maidah Tour initiator Farid Poniman claimed that more than 100,000 people had joined the movement and others would follow suit. When The Jakarta Post checked the apps on Sunday evening, more than 5,000 people had downloaded Al-Maidah Tour from Google Play Store. Farid said such a large number of supervisors was needed because he was certain that the potential for fraud on election day was great. Furthermore, the movement aimed to attract at least 1 million people who could monitor all 13,032 polling stations in the capital. “Besides trained volunteers, we will also deploy our top members at each polling station,” Farid said. Al-Maidah Tour also asked its volunteers to wear white attire for men and full black attire for women and recite Quranic verses and Takbir (praise to Allah) at their assigned polling stations. Due to the name and nature of the movement, people are afraid that the Al-Maidah Tour could intimidate Muslims into not voting for incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, who is a Christian of Chinese ethnicity, and vote for Anies Baswedan, who is supported by a number of conservative and radical Muslim groups, instead. Farid said that while the movement had not set out to support Ahok’s rival Anies Baswedan in the election, his team often communicated with Anies about the movement so they would not overlap with each other in the field. However, Anies’ team has claimed to be unaware of the AlMaidah Tour movement. At the same time, Ahok is grooming his own election witnesses to be stationed at polling stations, fueling concern over potential clashes between the Ahok camp and the movement. “But believe me, whatever the final result of the election, we are ready to accept it,” Farid said. “Make no mistake, we will not create any trouble or chaos.” However, many doubt that the Al-Maidah Tour will not raise a ruckus as the movement has strong ties to the FPI. FPI spokesperson Slamet Maarif confirmed that his organization would take part in the AlMaidah Tour movement by deploying around 16,000 people on voting day. However, Slamet said the FPI had no intention of intimidating voters, adding that its members’ presence at the polling stations was simply to ensure the election went ahead without a hitch. “On the contrary, we want to make sure that no intimidation happens during the election,” he said on Saturday. Farid, meanwhile, said a large number of people from outside of Jakarta participating in the movement would be accommodated by local FPI members. Farid himself is an official of an FPI-associated group, the National Movement to Safeguard the Indonesian Ulema Council’s Fatwa (GNPF-MUI). Devie Nova, a resident of Tanjung Priok in North Jakarta, said the presence of many strangers claiming to be a monitoring team at her polling station would cause nothing but anxiety and worry among her and her neighbors. She believed that official supervisory teams deployed by the Elections Supervisory Agency (Bawaslu) and the two candidates would be enough to monitor voting booths. “One hundred people [in each polling station] are just way too many. That many people would only make us feel anxious when we are casting our votes,” she said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/04/03/voters-fear-intimidation-from-anti-ahok-movement.html,"2017JakartaElection, sectarian-issues, ahok-djarot, Anies-Baswedan-Sandiaga-Uno",2017

He was questioned in relation to his alleged remarks on the pecalang in June last year, Bali Police’s special crimes director Sr. Comr.

In a discussion with Kompas media, Munarman had protested at how the media giant did not provide fair coverage of his group. He allegedly said that there were no news reports on pecalang who, he claimed, sometimes threw stones at Muslims’ houses and banned Muslims from performing prayers. Munarman refused to comment to journalists on his arrival at the police office. Police started the investigation following a report filed against him by an interfaith group in Bali in January. The Bali Police have accused Munarman of violating the Electronic Information and Transactions law (UU ITE) on spreading information to incite hatred, which carries a maximum sentence of six years in prison.

Indonesia, which recognizes marriage as union between a man and a woman, outlaws same-sex marriage. Farel’s identity was revealed after locals found a newborn baby dumped on Jl. Sei Kenagan, some 50 meters from her wife's house, on Thursday. Residents confronted the couple after becoming suspicious that it was Farel who had abandoned the baby. Daman Wuri, a resident who lives nearby, said locals were shocked by the incident. “Farel told us she was a widower with a child, so we were not suspicious when she married Salmah,” he said.

"Tue, January 24, 2017",Disbandment of mass organizations may undermine democracy: Expert,"Political experts have claimed that growing public pressure for the government to disband violent mass organizations, in particular the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), could undermine Indonesia’s democracy. “If it commits violence, just bring the members involved in the crime to justice, not immediately disband it,” Airlangga Pribadi Kusman, an Islam and political expert from Airlangga University in Surabaya, East Java, told The Jakarta Post . He was speaking on the sidelines of a discussion held by the Maarif Institute by the Muhammadiyah central executive board in Yogyakarta recently. Airlangga said if the government disbanded the FPI simply because of civil society pressure, there would be no basic argument to use against demands for the disbandment of any civil society organization. “It could happen at any time that a civil society organization is disbanded because its members are branded communists,” he said. Airlangga further explained the emergence of extreme mass organizations in Indonesian politics was because they were used by political elites who had an opposing stance to that of the ruling power. The elites used issues that could ignite ethnic, religious, racial and societal group (SARA) sentiments because they were easy to use to mobilize people who were disappointed with social injustices to fight against the ruling groups. “The opposing elites do not use social injustice issues because they themselves do not have solutions to tackle the problems,” said Airlangga.

This is dangerous,” Rizieq told reporters after the questioning. “We ask the government to retract all new banknotes, from the Rp 1,000 to Rp 100,000 bills, because they can all give the perception that there is a hammer and sickle logo on our banknotes,” said the firebrand preacher, who had to answer 23 questions from the police regarding his statement.

Sociologist Vedi R. Hadiz from the University of Melbourne told a discussion in Jakarta on Monday that the growing intolerance pushed by groups such as the FPI was the result of years of omission by the state. “Intolerant groups can continue to engage in their violent actions because there are part of a State that preserves them. Do we see any of these groups that attack minority groups such as the Ahmadiyah, for example, take accountability for their actions?” Vedi asked. Vedi encouraged law enforcers to punish any organization that disrupted peace and the public. However, Vedi also argued that “dissolving intolerant groups is anti-democracy.” Discussions on how to best discipline violent mass organizations have arisen once again after the FPI attracted public attention for mobilizing mass demonstrations calling for the imprisonment of incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian and a Chinese-Indonesian, for alleged blasphemy.

"Fri, January 20, 2017",Noose tightens around FPI leader,"Once lauded by his followers for standing in front of two-large scale rallies in Jakarta last year, Rizieq Shihab, the notorious leader of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), is now being investigated by the West Java Police, an ironic turn of affairs. For the last few months, Rizieq has been the loudest advocate for pushing blasphemy charges against Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, who is currently seeking re-election in the Jakarta gubernatorial race. After Ahok was named a suspect in the case and later stood trial, Rizieq continued to strongly voice his animosity toward the governor, whom he repeatedly called a “religion mocker”. The rallies also bolstered growing sectarianism in the country and somehow catapulted his notoriety to a higher level, generating concerns that Indonesia’s pluralism might be at risk. However, Rizieq, who was twice sentenced to prison for inciting hatred in 2003 and 2008, has now toned down his voice as he is asking the National Police to help him mediate with the people who have filed police reports against him. He even visited the House of Representatives on Tuesday to report the issues he was facing. Rizieq now faces public scrutiny as the police investigate five separate cases. These cases relate to Rizieq’s alleged blasphemy toward Christianity, insults to the State ideology Pancasila, comments over supposed communist symbols on Rupiah bank notes and hate speech. Rizieq is seen by many as the initiator of the massive rallies under the banner of the National Movement to Safeguard the In- donesian Ulema Council’s Fatwa (GNPF-MUI). The rallies attracted other conservative Islamic organizations and were joined by nearly half a million people in Jakarta. Now, however, it seems as though only his own group is coming to his defense. In what appears to be a turn of events for Rizieq, hundreds of people from several non-governmental organizations in Bandung, West Java, voiced their displeasure of him on Thursday. An irony, as the province is notorious for its rampant intolerance from hard-line and conservative Islamic groups, which also participated in the Rizieq-led rallies. The protestors called on the government to disband the FPI, arguing that the group had been actively involved in encouraging and supporting intolerant activities. “This is a form of solidarity to show that we, the people of West Java, are peaceful and united against intolerance. We will fight any anti-Pancasila group,” Fauzan Rachman, the chairman of the Indonesian Grassroots Movement (GMBI), said during the rally. One of the legal cases surrounding Rizieq presently being investigated by the West Java Police relates to an alleged insult to Pancasila, reported by the daughter of former president Sukarno, Sukmawati Soekarnoputri, in October last year. He was grilled by West Java Police investigators last week over his alleged speech that went viral on social media. West Java Police chief Insp. Gen. Anton Charliyan said the police had upped the status from preliminary investigation to full investigation in the Pancasila case. His status is still that of a witness in the case, said National Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Awi Setiyono on Thursday. Adi Prayitno, an expert in political Islam from the State Islamic University (UIN), said Rizieq’s confidence grew too aggressively after the Jakarta rallies because he probably believed that the protesters would continue to follow him because of the success of the rallies. “If Rizieq was named a suspect by the police then the move could dampen his dominance in the public sphere,” Adi told The Jakarta Post. Rizieq and several key members of the FPI did not respond to the Post’s inquires.

Law and Human Rights Minister Yasonna Hamonangan Laoly said Thursday the government planned to include violent and radical groups in the category of mass organizations that were against Pancasila and that should be banned in the country. “The existing law bans groups that promote, among other things, Leninist and communist values as they conflict with the values of Pancasila, but there are more values that are against Pancasila,” Yasonna said on the sidelines of a meeting at the House of Representatives. “Therefore we will expand the definition of anti-Pancasila in the revision because groups that are violent and destructive to the nation also violate Pancasila,” he emphasized.

Rizieq, an ardent critic of Ahok’s, has been reported to police for allegedly dishonoring the country’s first president, Sukarno, and Pancasila, the nation’s founding principles. He has also been reported for allegedly defaming Christianity. A senior political researcher with the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), Syamsuddin Haris, said Rizieq’s alleged involvement in those cases would lead the public to see Ahok in a positive light after prolonged hatred toward the governor, who stands accused of having insulted Islam. “Ahok still has a chance to win the election, although I predict the electoral process will include two rounds,” Syamsuddin said in a discussion on Thursday.

LSI researcher Ardian Sopa explained that Anies’ meeting with Rizieq earlier this month apparently disappointed his supporters who are mostly educated Jakartans and tolerant Moslems. “Habib [Rizieq] is popular among lower-income voters, but is not among those of the middle class, who make up Anies’ support base,” Ardian told the press on Tuesday. “The meeting with Habib [Rizieq] turns to have been an electoral blunder for the Anies-Sandiaga pair”.

The LSI survey has also found that Anies and Sandiaga would be eliminated from the race if an election took place today, leaving the Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono-Sylviana Murni ticket contesting a second round against the incumbent Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama-Djarot Syaiful Hidayat pair.(jun)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/17/meeting-with-fpi-harmed-anies-survey.html,,2017

"Tue, January 17, 2017",Prosecutors to present more remarks by Ahok,"Prosecutors are set on Tuesday to present witnesses to testify about more allegedly blasphemous remarks made by Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama. Fifi Lety Indra, a lawyer representing Ahok, said prosecutors had announced that they would resummon Bogor Islamic Forum secretary Willyudin Abdul Rasyid who previously reported the governor for alleged blasphemy in a speech he made in Tegallega, Bogor, on Sept. 6 . The court had earlier rejected the possibility of Willyudin providing testimony as it is examining the speech Ahok gave in Thousand Islands regency on Sept. 27 . “Prosecutors have prepared six witnesses, but their examination will depend on the judges. Judges usually only examine four or five witnesses in one hearing,” Fifi told The Jakarta Post on Monday. The other witnesses — Muhammad Asroi Saputra, Iman Sudirman and Ibnu Baskoro — who earlier reported Ahok for his Thousand Islands speech, will also testify. On Jan. 10, presiding judge Dwiarso Budi Santiarto adjourned the hearing after Ahok’s lawyers criticized the validity of Willyuddin’s police report against Ahok. During the hearing, defense lawyers revealed that Willyudin reported Ahok to the police on Oct. 7 for his speech in Tegallega. The lawyers said the report was suspicious given that Ahok was now being tried for his statement about a Quranic verse made during a working visit to Thousand Islands. Dwiarso then ordered the prosecutors to bring the Bogor police officers who were in charge of filing Willyudin’s report. “To verify [Willyudin’s] report, we order prosecutors to present the police officers,” Dwiarso said before postponing the hearing. Earlier hearings saw prosecutors presenting witnesses who had reported Ahok for the Thousand Islands speech. On Jan. 3, prosecutors summoned another four witnesses namely Islam Defenders Front (FPI) Jakarta chapter secretary Novel Bamukmin, Sharia Advocate chairman Gus Joy Setiawan, FPI Jakarta head Muchsin and Antiblasphemy Forum head Syamsu Hilal. The four all reported Ahok to the police after watching a video of Ahok’s speech, in which he commented on Surah Al Maidah 51 on Sept. 27 . Although the total length of the video is 1 hour and 48 minutes, the witnesses said that they had only focused on the shortened version of the video, in which Ahok’s comments on the Quranic verse run for about 13 seconds. They said the shorter video clearly showed that Ahok’s statement was blasphemous. Fifi said the defense team had prepared several witnesses, namely Juhri, Ferry Lukmantara, Suyanto, Fajrun and Analta Amir. She said Juhri, Ferry, Suyanto and Fajrun had witnessed the way in which several politicians had tried to deter voters from supporting Ahok in the 2007 East Belitung regional election by using Surah Al Maidah 51. Fifi added that Analta was Ahok’s Muslim godbrother. She added that defense lawyers did not plan to summon Sheikh Amr al-Wardani, a Quranic interpretation expert from the internationally respected Al-Azhar University in Cairo. Back in November, it was reported that Ahok’s lawyers would summon Sheikh to testify for Ahok in the case screening. However, the expert was unable to come to the case screening due to family matters.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/17/prosecutors-to-present-more-remarks-by-ahok.html,"ahok, basuki-tjahaja-purnama",2017

"Mon, January 16, 2017",Anies shifting toward conservatism,"Jakarta gubernatorial candidate Anies Baswedan has taken further steps to reach out to conservative Muslims by speaking at a mass gathering organized by the National Movement to Safeguard the Indonesian Ulema Council’s Fatwa (GNPF-MUI) on Sunday. At the gathering, the organization’s leader called on people to vote for a Muslim leader in the upcoming election. The group, which was behind recent large-scale sectarian rallies in Jakarta, organized the event in collaboration with the Jakarta Islamic Siyasah Ta’Lim Assembly. Posters for the event also displayed the hashtag #spirit212, in reference to a rally on Dec. 2 that demanded the prosecution of rival candidate and incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama for alleged blasphemy in Thousand Islands last September. The other rival candidate, Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono, was also slated to speak at the event at Al Azhar Grand Mosque on Jl. Sisingmangaraja in Kebayoran Baru, South Jakarta. However, the son of former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono did not attend due to the death of Hadi Utomo, a former chairman of Yudhoyono’s Democratic Party. Agus’ running mate Sylviana Murni was present but did not speak at the event. GNPF-MUI chairman Bachtiar Nasir told the audience that choosing a Muslim leader aligned with Islamic teachings and that Indonesian democracy allowed voters to exercise their rights in such a way. “I am not in a position to choose between the two Muslim candidates. But what is emphasized is that selecting a Muslim [at the next election] does not contradict democracy because you can choose leaders candidate based on faith and belief,” he said as quoted by tribunnews.com. State Islamic University (UIN) political expert Adi Prayitno said Anies had lost momentum in appealing to Muslim voters who, according to him, had largely fallen for Agus. Adi noted that Anies was experiencing difficulty in finding a place between Ahok and Agus, explaining his “zig zag” politics. “The most likely thing for Anies to do to increase his popularity is to rip supporters from AHY [Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono] from Islamic circles. Therefore, on many occasions in Anies’ political performance, he appears to be visibly Islamic [conservative], both in statements and political moves,” Adi told The Jakarta Post on Sunday. Several pollsters recently put the Anies-Sandiaga Uno ticket at the bottom of popularity surveys comparing the three pairs. In December, the Indonesian Survey Circle issued a survey showing that Anies-Sandiaga’s electability was the lowest at only 15.70 percent. Agus-Sylviana Murni got 33.6 percent while the incumbents Ahok-Djarot Syaiful Hidayat garnered 23.6. Also in December, an Indonesian Survey Institution (LSI) survey put Anies-Sandiaga at the bottom with 23.9 percent popularity. Topping the list was AhokDjarot with 31.8 percent followed by Agus-Sylviana (26.5 percent). Anies is widely known as a moderate Islamic scholar. During a recent visit to the Post’s office, Anies denied he had shifted from his moderate views. But he acknowledged he had to address sectarian issues because they “matter” to voters. (Read also: Anies says he visited FPI to quash rumors about his religious identity ) In the first official candidate debate on Friday, Anies cited morality and moral values among Jakarta residents as of importance should he become governor. Adi said Anies’ strategy was to strike a note as a moral guardian in the hope of gaining sympathy from Muslim voters. “That’s why Anies polishes himself to look sholeh [obedient], maintains morality and fights for Muslim aspirations. This effort is to evoke the emotions of Muslims who recently have been quite driven to defend Islam,” Adi said. Recently, Anies drew criticism after meeting with leaders of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) at its headquarters in Petamburan, Central Jakarta. Anies said his visit aimed to straighten out rumors surrounding his religious identity that might disadvantage him in the election.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/16/anies-shifting-toward-conservatism.html,"anies-baswedan, conservatives, fatwa, FPI",2017

Which one is better? Sukarno’s or the Jakarta Charter's?” Rizieq said in the video. Yusri added that the police's forensic laboratory center (Puslabfor) found that the footage of Rizieq commenting on the Pancasila was original, however, Rizieq claimed that his video had been edited.

Rizieq went to Bandung in West Java after the police sent the third summons, riding in his car with a license plate reading: B 1 FPI. Politician Sukmawati Soekarnoputri reported Rizieq to the police for a two-minute video of Rizieq speaking in Bandung. Sukmawati is the daughter of founding father Sukarno and the sister of Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) matriarch Megawati Soekarnoputri. She is also the sister of Rachmawati Soekarnoputri, who has been named a suspect for treason. Sukmawati said Rizieq insulted the state ideology, Pancasila, and had thus violated the law. In the video, Rizieq said there was a difference between Sukarno’s version of Pancasila and the one written in the Jakarta Charter. “In Sukarno’s Pancasila, faith in God is placed in the ass, but in the Jakarta Charter’s Pancasila, faith in God is placed in the head. Which one is better? Sukarno’s or the Jakarta Charter?” Rizieq said in the video. Rizieq said his speech was an explanation of his graduate thesis on Pancasila and sharia. He said he criticized Sukarno, who wanted to move “faith in God” from the first principle to the last in discussions with the country’s founding fathers in 1945. “What’s in the video was a two-minute excerpt from a two-hour lecture. You should have opposed a thesis with a thesis, not a police report,” he said.

Gatot Nurmantyo has defended the right of Islam Defenders Front (FPI) members as citizens of the country to participate in military training and argued that referring to the FPI as anti-Pancasila was debatable. In his response to journalists’ queries on the matter, Gatot emphasized that the military institution required regional commanders to submit proposals to hold the military-style training for FPI members, as well as other citizens, all across the archipelago. “[Regional commanders] submit the proposals to their superiors who will decide [if the FPI is anti-Pancasila or not],” Gatot told reporters when asked if the state defense program also welcomed anti-Pancasila groups like the FPI. (Read also: State defense training for FPI not allowed: TNI) Gatot did not comment when he was asked for his opinion about the FPI. The TNI has faced criticism after the Lebak military command in Banten trained FPI members in the area.

However, it must be done according to the proper procedures,” Gatot told the press on the sidelines of a gathering at TNI headquarters in Cilangkap, East Jakarta. Gatot explained that a recent training session for FPI members in Lebak, Banten, was questionable, unlike previous sessions that occurred in other parts of the country, because it violated protocol as Lebak military commander Lt. Col. Czi Ubaidillah did not inform his superiors about the training. “All regional commanders must inform their superiors [to host such training]. The procedure requires commanders of the Koramil [Subdistrict Military Command] to report to the Dandim [Regional Military Command], and then Dandim reports to Danrem [Military Resort Command],” he explained.

"Tue, January 10, 2017","‘Work, work and work’ isn’t enough: Anies","In his article “Don’t Just Do something, Talk”, eccentric Slovenian philosopher Slavoj _i_ek writes: “we often talk about doing something instead of actually doing it — but sometimes we do things in order to avoid talking and thinking about them.” That quotation may sum up gubernatorial candidate Anies Baswedan’s criticism of his opponent, incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama and, also, Anies’ former boss, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo. Anies once served as a minister in Jokowi’s Cabinet. During his visit to The Jakarta Post’s office on Monday, the gubernatorial hopeful, who was listed among the world’s top 100 public intellectuals by Foreign Policy in 2008, lamented the fact that fewer people these days appreciated the value of ideas and dialogue. “To be honest, in recent years, the country seems to no longer have any appreciation for ideas. Words seem to be unimportant. Meanwhile, [many think] what matters is work, work, work,” Anies said in an apparent jab at Jokowi’s famous tagline. Jokowi, who fired Anies in August last year, has described his administration as the “Working Cabinet” in a thinly veiled attack against preceding administrations. Ahok, Jokowi’s deputy when the latter was governor of Jakarta, shares Jokowi’s general philosophy and, during his term as governor, has focused his energy on getting things done, a trait that has apparently earned him both praise and derision. For Anies, building Jakarta needs more than just work. It also needs ideas and words. “It is not ‘we should talk less and work more,’ but ‘we should talk a lot and work a lot,’” Anies said. “A leader must lead and therefore he has to talk. Therefore, what I offer is: ideas, words and action,” he added. (Read also: Ahok’s opponents lack innovative programs) During his speech, Anies repeated his criticisms of Ahok’s leadership, arguing that the incumbent was focused too much on building “inanimate objects” and had overlooked the necessity of building human resources. He was referring to Ahok’s focus on expediting infrastructure development and what he claims to be Ahok’s lack of attention toward the city’s poor. The former rector of Paramadina University said that, if elected, he would engage the public to develop Jakarta and close the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots”. He said he would invite the private sector to help the city administration alleviate poverty. “There are so many kind people in Jakarta. Kindness is contagious. All people must be called upon to engage in [developing the city],” he said, citing his experience with Indonesia Mengajar (Teach for Indonesia), which he founded, as proof that asking people to help other people was not impossible. He said it was important to invite everyone, regardless of their background, to contribute to the city. In his attempt to engage the public, Anies has held meetings with a number of communities, including members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). His meeting with the FPI has drawn criticism from both his detractors and some of his supporters. Anies defended his decision to visit the headquarters of the FPI in Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta, saying that he was there to clarify rumors about him that could seriously hurt his chances in the election. He said he had been accused of being a Shiite, a liberal Muslim and a Wahabbi, a pejorative term used to refer to the strain of Islam widely practiced in Saudi Arabia. The accusations have circulated for years but he had never taken them seriously until he decided to run for office, Anies said, adding that religion turned out to be an important issue for Jakarta’s voters. “On the campaign trail, many voters asked me what my religion was. Not only that, they also asked whether my Islam was the true Islam or not. Then, they asked whether I was a Sunni or a Shiite. These are serious questions,” he said. “Therefore, I think it is important to clarify [the rumors].”",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/10/work-work-and-work-isnt-enough-anies.html,,2017

Only two non-Muslims are on the islands,” one of the residents, Saadah, told kompas.com on Sunday, referring to Novel Bamukmin, the secretary-general of the FPI's Jakarta chapter.

He used to be a principal of a junior high school,” said Faturrahman, who was former teacher and has been living on Pramuka Island since 1970. Both Faturrahman and Saadah, who attended the event on the island in September when Ahok made his subsequently controversial statement, claimed that what Ahok said was not insulting and did not defame Islam.

Novel and three other witnesses testified in Ahok’s fourth hearing at the North Jakarta District Court on Tuesday. Firing back at Ahok’s statement, Novel said it was police officers who typed Fitsa Hats in his interrogation document, not him. “I will again report Ahok to the police for accusing me of manipulating [the report] under the belief that I am ashamed of having worked at an American company,” he said on Wednesday. Novel said that with assistance from lawyer group Advokat Cinta Tanah Air (ACTA), he had reported Ahok to the police nine times regarding cases involving blasphemy. (ebf)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/05/ahok-unfazed-by-fitsa-hats-police-report.html,"ahok, basuki-tjahaja-purnama, FPI, blasphemy",2017

""Yes, I think probably he was ashamed because he is of the opinion that it is forbidden to be led by an infidel, [someone of] different faith,” Ahok said. The FPI led several massive rallies in Jakarta last year, which were joined by hundreds of thousands of people, against Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent. “I’m not ashamed. If I was ashamed, I wouldn’t have mentioned the job,” Novel said, adding that the “Fitsa Hats” part that was read during the hearing was missing when he rechecked the dossier. “I will again report Ahok to the police for accusing me of manipulating [the dossier] under the belief that I am ashamed of having worked at an American company,” he added.

We will ask the police to obtain data from his phone provider to see how many Thousand Islands residents called him on the afternoon of Sept. 27,” Ahok said in a press conference after the hearing at the Agriculture Ministry’s auditorium on Jl. RM Harsono, Pasar Minggu, South Jakarta.

It was further said that Ahok and his legal team had also discovered that another witness, Gus Joy, had lied about his status as a lawyer.

"Tue, December 20, 2016",Police told to resist undue influence of MUI,"Following the decision of some local police leaders to back a campaign by firebrand Muslim groups to crack down on Christmas celebrations, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has instructed National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian to uphold discipline among members of the force and make efforts to prevent their power from being abused by hardline groups. During a meeting with Tito at the State Palace on Monday, Jokowi said that the police force must work only to implement official rules and regulations. “Our existing rules are laws, government regulations, presidential regulations, ministerial regulations and so on, including a regulation from the police chief himself. That should be the ground rule,” Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung said. Jokowi summoned Tito on Monday following the decision by police chiefs in Bekasi in West Java and Kulon Progo regency in Yogyakarta to issue circulars ordering local officers to uphold an edict issued by the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) banning Muslims from wearing Christmas attributes, such as Santa hats. The MUI issued the fatwa on Dec. 14. Bekasi Police issued its circular on Dec. 15 while Kulonprogo Police released its circular on Dec. 17. Over the weekend, police in Surabaya, East Java, also came under fire for their failure to prevent members of the hardline Islam Defenders Front (FPI) from cracking down on business establishments that allowed their employees to wear Christmas attributes. Earlier on Monday, Tito ordered police officers to get tough on members and activists of hardline groups who carried out intolerant acts. “I instruct all police officers to arrest and take action against those who want to promote disorder. We shouldn’t bow to those groups,” Tito said. Tito also ordered members of the corps to keep an eye on groups that carried out intolerant acts under the guise of publicity programs for the MUI edicts. “Also, if we find some groups that carry out raids while claiming to be conducting ‘familiarization’, but in fact bring fear to people, we must take the initiative to stop them,” Tito said. The police chief said that he would discuss the issue with the MUI in the coming days. “I will talk with the MUI so that they take tolerance and Bhinneka Tunggal Ika [the country’s motto of “unity in diversity”] into consideration when they want to issue a fatwa,” he added. Jan Sihar Aritonang, a professor at the Theology School Jakarta, said that the MUI had wrongly identified symbols of consumerism, such as the Santa hat, as part of Christianity. “Production and distribution of such attributes are not directly related to Christianity. Until now, Christian churches have never reached any consensus about what could be considered as attributes or symbols for Christmas. They are just a tradition in some churches, particularly in Europe and America,” Jan said. Responding to the actions of the FPI in Surabaya, the MUI said that any Muslim groups that took the initiative to disseminate information regarding the Christmas edict should not use force against business owners who were unaware of the call. “The information about the fatwa can be relayed by sending one person to inform shop owners about it, or a letter should be enough,” said the MUI’s edict division head, Hasanuddin AF. Religious Affairs Minister Lukman Hakim Saifuddin meanwhile said that no private organizations had the authority to conduct such raids.

"Mon, December 19, 2016",Police back hard-liners clamping down on Christmas,"A fatwa issued by the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) banning Muslims from donning paraphernalia related to other faiths has inspired the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) to take the law into its own hands and push shopping centers in Surabaya, East Java, to not ask its Muslim workers to wear Christmas-related gear. Instead of stopping the FPI’s actions, police moved to secure the group’s visit to seven shopping centers on Sunday, arguing that their presence would prevent clashes between the group and shopping center managements. The management of Toeng Market had no choice but to comply after around 50 FPI members, escorted by the police, paid a visit. “We will deliver the demands to our superiors. We did not know about the fatwa. We will comply with it,” said Toeng Market operational division head Wahyu Kuncoro after FPI members thronged his office. The MUI has issued similar calls ahead of Christmas, but not until this year has the FPI followed up by protesting at shopping centers. An FPI leader in East Java, Ali Fahmi, said Toeng Market management had agreed to sign an agreement as a guarantee that it would comply with the MUI edict. “They already signed the agreement on a stamp,” Ali said. Surabaya Police chief Sr. Comr. M. Iqbal said police escorted FPI members as they visited seven shopping centers in Surabaya to prevent clashes. “The FPI members disseminated information about the edict. We guarded the process to ensure public safety,” Iqbal said. Police deployed hundreds of personnel to “guard” the FPI’s shopping center visits. The visits took place two days after members of an FPI branch in Bekasi, West Java, thronged a Honda dealership in the region after it was rumored that Muslims employees, including female staffers wearing hijab, had been forced to wear Santa hats. Bekasi Police chief Sr. Comr. Umar Fana said police, together with several Islamic organizations, had met with the dealership’s management on Wednesday morning to discuss the matter. Islamic organization Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), which has around 60 million members across the country, lambasted the FPI for acting like a law enforcement agency. “The state must be present in this case to not let any mass organization exercise its own law on the streets. The Religious Affairs Ministry is taking this incident seriously. The ministry will not give room for radicalism to grow in Indonesia. The MUI has the duty to disseminate information about the edict, not a mass organization,” NU deputy secretary-general Imam Putudu said. Rights watchdog Setara Institute, which campaigns for pluralism, said an MUI fatwa was not a legal and binding ruling that must be followed by shopping centers, adding that police should have prevented the FPI in the first place and not facilitated them in carrying out such intimidation on department store management. “Such groups have grown confident following the mass rallies in Jakarta. The National Police should not support edicts that threaten religious diversity,” Setara researcher Ismail Hasani said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/12/19/police-back-hard-liners-clamping--down-on-christmas.html,intolerance,2016

We apologize, because we were not aware of this before. We will follow and obey the MUI edict,” he said after receiving FPI representatives at his office. About 50 FPI members visited shopping centers on Sunday, meeting the managers in charge to tell them not to force employees to wear Christmas attributes. FPI official Ali Fahmi said the management of Toeng Market had signed an agreement. Ali said two points had been agreed to: first, that managers not tell Muslim employees to wear Christmas attributes and second, that they not force, intimidate or reward any employee in connection with Christmas attributes. Surabaya’s Nahdlatul Ulama executive board member Ahmad Muhibin Zuhri said the MUI edict aimed to uphold tolerance among people of different religions. “Tolerance is to give each religious follower space to worship according to one’s faith,” he said. Muhibin said the FPI’s action on Sunday was merely an act of exercising a civil right, although NU itself felt it would have been enough to disperse information on the edict through the media. Surabaya Police, which had escorted the FPI in visiting the malls, said they had made sure the visits did not cause any disturbances. “In total, we visited seven shopping centers to disseminate information about the edict.

The FPI jointly organized two massive rallies in Jakarta on Nov. 4 and Dec. 2 to push for the prosecution of Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent, who allegedly made a blasphemous comment about a Quranic verse during a visit to Thousand Islands regency in late September. Investigations by law-enforcement agencies, however, found that the sources of the fake news were internet portals in Australia and the United States, Gatot said. Cases like this, he said, had to be dealt with in the spirit of unity, by upholding the national philosophy of Bhinneka Tunggal Ika – Unity in Diversity. “If there is no Islam, it is not Indonesia; if there is no Christianity, it is not Indonesia; if there is no Hinduism, it is not Indonesia; if there is no Buddhism; it is not Indonesia,” he said.

"Wed, December 7, 2016","FPI won't gain popularity from recent anti-Ahok rallies, expert says","The mass rallies on Nov. 4 and Dec. 2 to protest Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama’s allegedly blasphemous statement will not win the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) more supporters, an expert has said. Islamic scholar from the country's largest Islamic organization Nahdlatul Ulama, Zuhairi Misrawi, argued that the mass rallies were successful thanks to the organizing body’s reference to the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), the nation’s top Muslim clerical body. (Read also: FPI limits rally to Monas ) The rallies were organized by a group calling itself the National Movement to Safeguard the Indonesian Ulema Council’s Fatwa (GNPF-MUI). Despite having the word MUI attached to its name, the group is not part of the MUI. However, some of the people in the group are from the FPI. Ahok was charged with blasphemy after an edited video with an incorrect caption went viral in October that showed him mentioning a verse in the Quran when speaking in front of a group of fishermen in the Thousand Islands. The MUI later issued an edict stating that Ahok’s remarks in the video had insulted the Quran. “They [the organizing team] used the name of the MUI,” Zuhairi told The Jakarta Post . “[The people attending the rallies] have nothing to do with the FPI, they are more passionate about [upholding] the MUI’s edict,” Zuhairi added. Zuhairi also said the two rallies would not help garner more support for the FPI, known as a notorious vigilante group due to its raids on Jakarta nightclubs, especially during the fasting month of Ramadan. Zuhairi said people would remain critical of the FPI for the raids it carried out.

The gathering, to begin at the National Monument (Monas) square at 8 a.m. , is aimed at pushing for the arrest of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama in a blasphemy case. Most of the participants leaving from FPI headquarters were wearing white Muslim attire. “The buses have been standing here since [ Thursday ] afternoon,"" said Teguh, a local resident. Teguh said most of the participants had gathered at the FPI headquarters on Thursday and spent the night there. As many as 200,000 demonstrators are expected to join the Monas gathering, which is scheduled to run until 1 p.m. This will be a follow-up to a large-scale anti-Ahok rally on Nov. 4, when protesters, mostly from Muslim groups, swarmed onto Jakarta streets to demand Ahok's prosecution in a blasphemy case. Last month, the National Police named Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent, a suspect of blasphemy over comments on a Quranic verse the governor had made during a visit to Thousand Islands regency in September.

In a release made available on Thursday, Sejuk said it received a report that Reja was hit and told to go away by an FPI member on Wednesday at 2:15 p.m. when he was in Petamburan, Central Jakarta, near the FPI headquarters. In the chronology outlined by Reja, the journalist wrote in his report circulating in several journalists’ chat groups that the man tried to prohibit him from writing any news about the FPI meeting ahead of the rally and demanded he delete anything he had already written. He also said he didn’t trust the media.

Sejuk said two other journalists, one from Gatra magazine and another from the Jawa Post News Network, were also forced to go away and told they were not allowed to write news about the preparations for a Dec. 2 rally, which is being undertaken by, among others, the FPI. “We call on the police to investigate the case,” the association said. Sejuk is also calling on the public and participants in the Dec. 2 rally to respect press freedom and journalists’ endeavors to report the facts to the public.

"Mon, November 28, 2016","After FPI tipoff, police raid alleged gay sex party, arrest 13","Along with a group of hard-liners, the Pancoran Police arrested 13 men on Saturday night at an apartment block in South Jakarta for allegedly holding “a sex party”. Despite no strong evidence that the men had committed any crime, around 50 members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) barged into an apartment in the Kalibata City apartment complex and forced the police to arrest the 13 men. Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Raden Prabowo Argo Yuwono said Sunday the incident began after a circulated message about the alleged sex party was received by an FPI member. The member went to the unit and found a group of men not wearing any shirts before making a report to the Pancoran Police. Escorted by the police and apartment security personnel, the mob entered the apartment and police officers took the men into custody. However, Raden said the police were still investigating whether the men had committed any crime, saying that the only items that were confiscated during the raid were smartphones, condoms, and antiretroviral drugs for HIV patients. “We are not sure if there was any prostitution, all we know is they were playing some games there,” Raden told reporters. The Jakarta Post’s source, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, said the mob came at about 11:30 p.m. to one of the towers in the apartment complex. Members of the mob were shouting “Allahu Akbar!” The source said the police arrived shortly after midnight. FPI’s public relations division said on their Twitter account @HumasFPI on Sunday that the group’s “investigation unit” along with the police “successfully broken up” the alleged sex party. The Post’s source in the police said the men had not violated any laws. In Indonesia, homosexual sodomy is not a crime except when it is done with an underage individual. It was not the first time the police have barged into a private event following pressure from conservative religious groups.

""We will summon language experts to see whether Dhani's speech had criminal intent,"" Jakarta Police Spokesman Sr. Comr. Awi Setiyono said on Thursday.

The ulemas are the successors of the Prophet Muhammad, [the ulemas are] sitting here but are not welcome by the President.” The rally ended in violence with two police cars set on fire and several officers and protesters injured.

"Thu, November 24, 2016",Jokowi shrugs off threat of instability,"With the security forces ready to deal with more rallies by conservative Muslims demanding the arrest of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo appeared to be at ease on Wednesday, calling such protests as the noise of democracy. In a meeting with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte at the State Palace, Jokowi said it was only natural for democracy to “get a little noisy sometimes”. “You may have heard we had some demonstrations and some political tensions recently. We have this kind of political outburst from time to time. We are becoming used to it. We gladly accept it as a price of democracy,” Jokowi said. Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab announced on Wednesday that the FPI along with other conservative Muslim groups, united in the National Movement to Safeguard the Indonesian Ulema Council’s Fatwa (GNPF-MUI), would go ahead with its rally plans on Dec. 2 to demand the government arrest Ahok for alleged blasphemy. Ahok, who is seeking reelection in February, inadvertently provoked Muslims when he cited a verse from the Quran during a gathering with residents in Thousand Islands, Jakarta. The protests did not stop even after the National Police began to question Ahok as a suspect in the case. Ahead of the anticipated rally, the President publicly met several influential figures, putting on display the stable support of his government. Last week, Jokowi met with Gerindra Party chairman Prabowo Subianto, signaling the possibility of new terms between the former rivals who competed against each other in the 2014 presidential election. On Monday, he met with former president and Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle chairwoman Megawati Soekarnoputri and later United Development Party (PPP)chairman Romahurmuziy, on Tuesday, to discuss various political issues. The heightened communications with the political and Muslim leaders have resulted in solid support behind the government. Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama, the country’s two largest Muslim organizations, have denounced the rallies and called on Muslims to refrain from participating in them. The GNPF-MUI was behind an earlier mass rally on Nov. 4, which later turned violent. Muhammadiyah chairman Haedar Nashir later called on all Muslims on Wednesday to accept the decision of the police who have named Ahok a suspect in the blasphemy case. “We strongly support the law enforcement authorities in upholding justice against those who have done wrong,” Haedar said as quoted by Antara news agency. Security forces have been on high alert ahead of any planned rallies. The Jakarta Police have taken a tougher stance, having issued a circular to remind people that an act of treason could result in the death penalty. “In expressing one’s thought in public, it is illegal to carry out [an act that will jeopardize] the nation’s security such as treason against the President or the Vice President,” the circular stated, which was signed by Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Mochammad Iriawan. In a move to ensure that everyone is aware of the law, the police plan to drop around 50,000 copies of the circulars from a helicopter. The police have also named Buni Yani, who posted a video of Ahok addressing Thousands Islands residents, a suspect, accusing him of inciting public anger against the governor. The Jakarta Legal Aid Institute (LBH Jakarta) has cautioned against the police’s stern action, saying it could disrupt the process of democracy. “Police intelligence must be proactive, but not to the point where it could restrict the space for democracy. This incident risks becoming a precedent in future expressions of opinion,” LBH Jakarta director Alghiffari Aqsa told The Jakarta Post. Beyond the capital, pressure and insults from conservative Muslim groups allegedly wishing to topple Jokowi have sparked public anger in a number of regions supporting the President in Central Java, especially in Banyumas regency. Members of the community expressed a readiness to fight to protect Jokowi if the groups continued with their threats. They have erected dozens of banners thorughout Banyumas capital of Purwokerto.

"Tue, November 22, 2016",Cops talk tough on Dec. 2 rally,"The authorities have insisted that they will not permit next month’s planned large-scale rally in Jakarta because the demonstration, which was originally aimed at demanding the prosecution of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama for blasphemy, has been taken over by political elements aimed at destabilizing President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s administration. National Police Chief Gen. Tito Karnavian and Indonesian Military (TNI) commander Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo held a meeting on Monday to discuss the planned Dec. 2 rally. Tito said the police would not allow the demonstration, which was expected to consist of mass Friday prayers performed on Jl. Thamrin and Jl. Sudirman, as well as the Hotel Indonesia Traffic Circle, all in Central Jakarta, because “freedom of speech is never absolute.” Wider concern for the well-being of the public should be the priority, he said. “Based on the 1998 Freedom of Speech Law, [demonstrating] is the people’s constitutional right but it must not contravene other people’s rights or public order and must not close major streets,” said the former Jakarta police chief. If the protesters insist on staying in the area, or fighting with the police, the police will take stern measures against them, he added. He also threatened to charge the protesters with treason should they become violent or visibly attempt to undermine the government. Gatot, meanwhile, said the two forces had worked together to uncover the mastermind behind the planned rally. “Intelligence agencies from the police and the TNI have gathered information as to who has encouraged them to take part in the rally,” said Gatot, adding that the TNI were ready to take part in a “jihad” in defense of national unity. The two made the statement following a plan by Muslim organizations, grouped under the National Movement to Save Indonesian Ulema Council’s Edict (GNPF-MUI), to hold a massive rally on Dec. 2. They claim the protest is aimed at demanding the police detain incumbent gubernatorial candidate and blasphemy suspect Ahok. The organizations held a similar rally on Nov. 4, in which more than 100,000 people took part, to demand the police charge Ahok with blasphemy, which has since been done. They initially announced they would hold the next protest on Nov. 25. Tito said the police had received information that there could still be demonstrations on Nov. 25, especially at the House of Representatives. Firebrand Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab has claimed that the demonstration would be “very peaceful” since it would only comprise Friday prayers, Quran readings, mass prayers, dzikir (chants), as well as shalawat (prayers to the Prophet Muhammad), even though they would occupy the highway from the Semanggi intersection to the State Palace. Regardless, Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. M. Iriawan said full-scale security measures were in place to ensure security in the capital. Separately, Religious Affairs Minister Lukman Hakim Saifuddin also questioned the plan to hold another rally, especially since the police had named Ahok a suspect. “But if [another rally] is deemed necessary, it should be held in accordance with the law,” Lukman said. In response, Islamic People’s Forum (FUI) secretary-general Muhammad Al-Khaththath accused the authorities of committing a crime if they prohibited the rally. “[Demonstrating] is guaranteed by the law,” he said. FPI spokesman Munarman, meanwhile, denied any political motivation behind the planned rally. “Through this [demonstration] we actually want to deliver prayers so that Indonesia will be saved from ‘actors’ who want to divide the nation,” he said. Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence (Kontras) civil and political rights division head Putri Kanesia said the authorities should protect people’s freedom of expression. “Authorities can carry out actions against [the protesters] if they violate the law, however, the enforcement should still be conducted in a persuasive way,” Putri said.

"Sat, November 19, 2016",Jokowi should meet with FPI to tone down protests: Lawmaker,"House of Representatives Deputy Speaker Fahri Hamzah has suggested President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo meet leaders of Islamic organizations, including Habib Rizieq of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) who previously arranged a Nov. 4 mass demonstration, to ease tensions. “If Pak Jokowi can be friends with Pak Prabowo, why not with them [FPI]?” said the controversial lawmaker on Friday, referring to Gerindra Party chairperson Prabowo Subianto, who lost the 2014 presidential race to Jokowi. Jokowi has recently met with Prabowo twice, with the latest meeting taking place at the Presidential Palace on Thursday. This has been seen as a move by Jokowi to secure Prabowo’s support amid mounting protests against his presidency over allegations the President has not been impartial in his response to the blasphemy case impacting non-active Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama. Jokowi has also conducted a series of visits to state security institutions, including the Indonesian Military and National Police. “I don’t understand why Pak Jokowi doesn’t think it’s important to meet leaders of the mass demonstration, whom he refused to meet on Nov. 4 […] but agreed to meet leaders of various other groups?” the Islamic-based Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) politician added. Fahri was confident that if Jokowi met with Rizieq and his supporters, criticism against his administration could be eased, particularly ahead of another planned demonstration slated for Dec. 2.

"Sat, November 19, 2016",Government moves to defuse tension,"Amid growing polarization among voters ahead of the simultaneous regional elections, the authorities have scrambled to ease the seemingly unabated tension stemming from an alleged blasphemy case. As President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has been occupied in the past couple of weeks convening with a number of political and religious bigwigs, the Indonesian Military (TNI) and the National Police have taken several soft-approach measures aimed at defusing the tension. Several conservative Muslim fringe groups have refused to lower the tension although the National Police declared Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja “Ahok” Purnama, a Christian of Chinese descent, a suspect in the blasphemy case on Wednesday. In anticipation of another round of rallies by conservative Muslims, who will also join forces with labor unions, not only in Jakarta but in other places in the archipelago next week or in early December, the TNI and the National Police held on Friday a joint massive prayer at the National Monument in Central Jakarta. Aimed at resonating peace and tolerance, around 20,000 personnel from all elements of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, as well as from the National Police, held a mass prayer under the theme “prayer for the safety of the nation”. A dozen habibs (religious leaders) participated in the event. The event was also participated in by thousands of orphans from orphanage foundations and members of pengajian (Islamic learning forum) groups across Jakarta, and family members of the security personnel. At the same time, five worship places in the capital — the Jakarta Cathedral, GPIB Immanuel Church, HKBP Cililitan, GKI Kwitang and Pura Mustika Dharma — also held similar mass prayers led by their respective religious leaders. National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian said amid the growing polarization among voters who support different candidates, it was important to remind people not to blend politics with religious, ethnic and racial issues, which had the potential to disturb a democratic election. “In Jakarta we have witnessed how the road to the gubernatorial election has involved such dynamics, and there has also been escalated tension that has caused security instability,” Tito said. Since a dozen of conservative Muslim groups reported Ahok to the police in October, accusing him of blasphemy, the movement to have him prosecuted has grown bigger, culminating in the violent Nov. 4 rally in front of the State Palace and triggering a minor riot in a Chinese residential area in North Jakarta. “Security forces will continue to ensure stability and security. However, human efforts won’t suffice if we don’t have God’s blessings,” said Tito. TNI Commander Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo said the Friday mass prayers served as a reminder that the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia could only be realized with the help of figures from different religious backgrounds who fought for the country’s independence. Shortly after the event, firebrand Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab confirmed that groups of anti-Ahok protesters would stage a third major rally against the governor on Dec. 2. The groups are under the so-called National Movement of Indonesian Ulema Council Edict Supporters (GNPF MUI). Rizieq, however, claimed that the demonstration would be “very peaceful” although the protesters would occupy the highway between the Semanggi intersection and the Presidential Palace. He said the rally would only include Friday Prayer, Quran readings, mass prayers, dzikir (chants), as well as shalawat (prayers to Prophet Muhammad). “Because Ahok still runs free, we have decided to stage another protest. Ahok should be jailed, it is the legal procedure. All suspects charged under Article 156 (a) of the Criminal Code in Indonesia’s history are always imprisoned,” FPI spokesman Munarman said. In opposition to such a movement, a coalition of civil society groups is set to hold a “Bhinneka Tunggal Ika Parade”, a theme derived from the country’s motto “unity in diversity”, in the capital on Saturday. Participants of the rally are expected to wear red-and-white clothes or Indonesia’s traditional clothes and are prohibited from representing any organization, company or political party. Coordinating Political, Legal, and Security Affairs Minister Wiranto has questioned the GNPF MUI’s plan to hold another demonstration, saying that since the authorities had already fulfilled their demand to process Ahok through a transparent and fair mechanism, they should just wait for the next legal process. Police chief Tito was suspicious that the demand to have Ahok imprisoned was politically motivated. “The due process is still ongoing. I suspect those demanding the imprisonment have a certain political agenda for the upcoming elections.”",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/11/19/govt-moves-to-defuse-tension.html,"unity, tension, Monas",2016

Gen. Ari Dono Sukmanto said at his office in Central Jakarta on Friday. The case screening is slated to be held in the main meeting room at the headquarters of the National Police on Nov. 15. The police have questioned FPI chairman Habib Rizieq Shihab and MUI chairman Ma'aruf Amin in regards to Ahok’s alleged blasphemy. Both of them expressed the firm belief that Ahok had committed blasphemy after citing a Quranic verse while talking to residents of Thousand Islands regency earlier this year. The MUI consultative board said on Wednesday that it expected the police to utilize the council’s religious opinion while investigating Ahok to deliver a sense of justice to all Muslims in Indonesia. Ari refused to respond to this request. “I don't want to make any comments about it. Everyone has a different sense of justice.

Meanwhile, HMI legal team coordinator Muhammad Syukur Mandar expressed his concern about Iriawan’s statement, saying that while it did not only violate the code of ethics of the police, it may offer grounds for a case. “The National Police chief and the President should be consistent in enforcing the law.

"Mon, November 7, 2016",Violence stems from inter-ethnic tensions,"Pre-existing inter-ethnic tensions could explain the looting and violence that broke out in majority Chinese-Indonesian areas in North Jakarta on Friday night. Police also say the violence had nothing to do with the massive rally held by Muslim groups on the same day. The rioting was likely fueled by existing tensions in the area and initiated by local mobs taking advantage of the situation caused by the religious rally in Central Jakarta, historian from Pelita Harapan University Yosef M. Djakababa said. “It is the excess that arises and can occasionally explode, such as it did on Friday, because of long existing seeds of suspicion between communities in the area,” Yosef said on Sunday. Relations between different ethnic groups in Indonesia more or less have their roots in the colonial period, including the division of different regions and the make-up of their populations, he said. However, he expressed regret that ethnic tension remained in some areas. The government and local figures must also facilitate communication and interaction between residents in the area to ease pre-existing tensions and avoid further clashes, Yosef said. “The government must be present, and the communities in the locations must continue to work hard to reduce mutual suspicion, and that is not attained by building higher walls in residential areas,” he said. Meanwhile, sociologist from state University of Indonesia Ricardi S. Adnan noted that trauma from 1998 was still too significant to allow a repeat of such events, adding that the rally had attempted to stay focused on its main goal, which was to demand that the police prosecute Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama for alleged blasphemy. However, Ricardi continued, crowds could be breeding grounds for out-of-control incidents. “In a crowd situation, there is always a risk of actions that are beyond control, as well as other parties who take advantage of a violent situation for their own gain,” he said. The police on Sunday named 13 suspects for their alleged involvement in the riot in Penjaringan, North Jakarta. “Twelve people were initially declared suspects and we named another one after further investigation,” Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Awi Setiyono said in a statement on Sunday. Besides naming 13 suspects, Awi said police had also put 16 names on a wanted list for their alleged involvement in the riot. On Saturday, at least 10 businesses were recorded as being victims of the attacks. They included two convenience stores, an Alfamart and an Indomaret, and Bakso Tukul, a meatball soup outlet owned by well-known comedian Tukul Arwana. Police lines have been set up around the area, located in front of the Pakin Transjakarta bus station, while as of Saturday night broken glass was still scattered around. People also pelted stones at police officers when the looting broke out at around 7:30 p.m. Paryanto, 35, a field coordinator for vendors in Jl. Gedong Panjang in Penjaringan, said that most of the vendors affected were not traumatized by the invasion of hundreds of looters, but regretted their losses which were estimated to reach hundreds of millions of rupiah. Meanwhile, despite initial fears residents of the Chinatown area of Glodok in West Jakarta, said they would keep their businesses open as usual but would stay alert. Ahok, a Christian and Indonesian of Chinese descent, has sparked uproar among Muslim groups after he made a comment about a verse of the Quran during a visit to the Thousand Islands regency in late September. At least 100,000 people swarmed the streets of Central Jakarta demanding the outspoken governor be prosecuted over his allegedly blasphemous remarks.

"Sat, November 5, 2016",Rally erupts in violence,"A massive rally calling for the criminal prosecution of Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja “Ahok” Purnama for alleged blasphemy ended in violence on Friday night as protesters defied a police order to disperse. At midnight, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo praised the rally’s Muslim leaders for keeping the rally in order during the day. “However, we regretted the violence in the evening. Political actors took advantage of this situation,” he said. The President further stated that the legal process against Ahok would take place in a transparent fashion. The anti-Ahok rally ran peacefully early in the day, but soon after dusk, violence broke out following a scuffle involving a small number of protesters, who were allegedly members of the Muslim Students Association (HMI) and activists from the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), the firebrand Islamic organization that played a leading role in Friday’s protest. In a strange turn of events, the FPI joined forces with the police at one point to call for the HMI students to disperse and not to get closer to the State Palace. As the scuffle broke out between the riot police and the alleged HMI students, unidentified protesters torched three police trucks parked on the corner of Monas Square. In the midst of the chaotic situation, the police started firing tear gas and used water canons to disperse the crowd. Learning about the clash, hundreds of protesters, who were on their way back to Istiqlal Mosque, started streaming back to the area near the State Palace. Three police officer was reported to have been injured in the confrontation. Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Wiranto went down to the protest site near the State Palace soon after 9 p.m. to calm down the protesters. “They should have all dispersed. They know me, they should have calmed down. Back off,” Wiranto told the protesters. Some of the protesters retreated and headed toward the House of Representatives complex. Earlier this week, People’s Consultative Assembly (MPR) Speaker Zulkifli Hasan, a National Mandate Party (PAN) politician, said the compound would be open to protesters who wanted to spend the night there after the protest. Earlier on in the protest, signs promoting violence could be seen in the crowd, which was composed of a number of Muslim groups. Some of the signs used strong language to condemn Ahok’s statements about a verse in the Quran, which the protestors deemed as insulting to the Muslim faith. Carrying banners reading “prosecute Ahok,” “arrest Ahok,” and “Ahok go home,” some groups in the crowd threatened Ahok with death. Some protesters gathered in front of Istiqlal Mosque were caught on camera chanting “bunuh, bunuh si Ahok sekarang juga” (kill, kill Ahok right now).” Marching on: Muslims march along Jl. MH Thamrin during a rally in Jakarta on Friday. Around 100,000 Muslims took to the streets on Friday demanding the prosecution of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama for alleged blasphemy. They called on the police to immediately detain Ahok.(JP/Wendra Ajistyatama) Elsewhere, near Gambir Station, a group of protesters hung a makeshift banner bearing the words: “gantung Ahok disini” (Hang Ahok right here). While the majority of the more than 100,000 protesters who showed up for the anti-Ahok rally were concentrated around the State Palace, a small number of protesters managed to reach the residential area of Pantai Mutiara, Pluit, North Jakarta, where Ahok lives. The crowd failed to enter the residential complex, which was heavily guarded by scores of personnel from the Jakarta Police and the Indonesian Military (TNI). The protestors could only chant “Ahok, get out,”. The protesters carried a banner reading “Laskar Masjid Luar Batang” (Luar Batang Mosque Militia). Luar Batang residents have been in dispute with the Jakarta administration following the city’s plan to demolish houses in the area as part of the revitalization of the mosque for religious tourism. The Friday protest went smoothly during the day without any incidents and the majority of the protesters left the demonstration grounds before 6 p.m., the deadline given by the Jakarta Police for the rally. Some of the protestors enjoyed the festive mood of the demonstration. The security authorities have been credited for taking measures aimed at easing tensions. Along the way from Istiqlal Mosque, where the protesters gathered for Friday prayers, to the State Palace, food and drinks provided by the FPI were easily available for the marchers. “The supplies were delivered by the leaders at our headquarters in Petamburan [in Central Jakarta],” said Anwar, an FPI member. Anwar said he did not know who had financed the purchase of the food. Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Mochamad Iriawan said that in order to prevent possible clashes, on-duty police personnel were not allowed to use firearms or bayonets. Police personnel were also instructed to chant the Asmaul Husna (the 99 names of God) to calm down the crowd if they became violent. The Jakarta Police also dispatched dozens of female officers wearing hijabs to stand guard in front of the State Palace in the hope of calming protesters. It was at this peaceful stage of the rally that leaders of the demonstration tried to negotiate their way into the State Palace to meet with the President. But because Jokowi, who on Thursday pledged to remain at the palace during the rally, decided to go to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang, Banten, for an impromptu visit to check on the progress of the construction of a railway network linking downtown Jakarta with the airport, the leaders of the demonstration could only meet with Wiranto. Religious Affairs Minister Lukman Hakim Saifuddin also attempted to talk with the protesters. At around 3 p.m., however, the protesters declined to negotiate with Wiranto and insisted on meeting with Jokowi. “Yes, I am representing the government. We are representing the government,” Wiranto told the leaders, referring also to Lukman Hakim, National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian and Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung. The rally leaders declined to talk with Wiranto and left the grounds of the State Palace. “I can’t [go on]. I’m just a messenger,” said Muslim cleric Bachtiar Nasir, one of the rally’s leaders. Later in the afternoon, the protest leaders agreed to meet with Vice President Jusuf Kalla at his office on Jl. Medan Merdeka Utara in the vicinity of the State Palace. Speaking after the meeting, Kalla said the investigation into the alleged blasphemy case implicating Ahok would be completed within two weeks. “Our conclusion is that in the case involving Ahok, we will uphold the law indiscriminately and it will be completed within two weeks,” Kalla told reporters. Tito earlier said that the National Police’s Criminal Investigation Department had scheduled a questioning session for Nov. 7 and would soon summon Ahok.

"Fri, November 4, 2016","Free food, drinks keep protesters happy","The massive rally organized by Muslim organizations against Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja ""Ahok"" Purnama has seen a seemingly endless flow of free food and drinks to keep protesters happy. The Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) drove in trucks filled with bags of food. ""The logistics were delivered by our leaders at our headquarters in Petamburan [in Central Jakarta],"" said Anwar, an FPI member. Anwar said he did not know who financed the food purchases. An organization known as Indonesian Muslim Unity (PUI) also deployed dozens of its members to distribute food in plastic bags. ""Giving is also part of jihad. This free food is to strengthen our spirit in the rally,"" said Rosidah, a PUI member from Bekasi, West Java. The rally was organized to urge the police to charge Ahok, who is seeking a second term in the February gubernatorial election, with blasphemy over his statement about a Quranic verse.

"Thu, November 3, 2016",Anti-Ahok protesters flock FPI headquarters,"More than 200 people have already gathered at the headquarters of the hardline group the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) in Petamburan, West Jakarta, for Friday's mass rally to demand that incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki ""Ahok"" Tjahaja Purnama be charged for his allegedly blasphemous remarks. Wearing caps and white T-shirts or white attire, the protesters, who came from various cities, planned to spend the night at Al Islah Mosque, located a few meters away from the FPI's headquarters. The organization, which is among the protest's initiators, distributed boxes of rice, mineral water and oranges to the protesters gathered at the mosque. Ridho, one of the protesters, said he arrived in the capital from Bogor, West Java, in the morning. The FPI headquarters, he said, was previously not his destination and he and several other people coming from Bogor had planned to sleep at the Istiqlal Grand Mosque in Central Jakarta. ""However, we were not allowed to sleep at the mosque so here we are now,"" he told The Jakarta Post . ""We will start the rally in the morning early tomorrow."" FPI official Rizieq Syihab had asked Jakarta mosque caretakers to open their doors to protesters who were going take part in the rally.

"Thu, November 3, 2016",More Muslim groups to join anti-Ahok rally,"As hundreds of Islamic hard-liners leave their hometowns to join a planned rally in Jakarta on Friday, the police and military have flexed their muscles, showing off thousands of personnel ready to secure the demonstration. Protesters in some regions, however, decided to hold simultaneous demonstrations in nearby cities, expanding the scale of the tensions to the national level, with security concerns raised across the archipelago. Hundreds of people reportedly left Bandung, West Java, on Wednesday to join the Nov. 4 rally in Jakarta, which is aimed at demanding the prosecution of gubernatorial candidate and incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama for blasphemy. West Java Islamic Movement Alliance head Asep Syaripudin said 11 buses and 23 cars had left for Jakarta so far. He said the demonstrators came from different groups, such as the Indonesian Muslim Student Action Union, the Greater Bandung Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and the Islamic Reform Movement. He added that they came from areas across the province, including Sumedang, Garut, Tasikmalaya, Ciamis and Pangandaran regencies. Separately, the leader of the FPI’s Karawang chapter, Ade Dahyar, said the organization would send at least 400 of its members. FPI members from Jambi will also join the rally in Jakarta. “As many as 162 FPI members from Jambi will depart on Thursday to join FPI members from all over Indonesia,” Jambi FPI regional representative board secretary Abdullah Hamid said on Wednesday. In Pekanbaru, Riau, thousands of hard-liners claimed they would hold a rally in the provincial capital. The Pekanbaru Police said they had received a proposal from Islamic organizations to stage a rally that could see over 2,000 demonstrators hit the city’s streets. Pekanbaru Police chief Sr. Comr. Toni Hermawan said some 500 personnel would secure the rally. Separately, head of the Religious Affairs Ministry’s Riau office, Ahmad Supardi Hasibuan, said he had gathered all executives of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) from across the province to discuss the planned rally, as he had heard that hundreds of Muslims from Riau would also depart for Jakarta. Pekanbaru city councilor Mulyadi was among those intending to join the peaceful rally in Jakarta. “I am already in Jakarta. We are not being paid for the rally. This is purely my personal intent,” the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) politician said. Similar rallies are reportedly set to take place in other cities, such as Makassar and Surabaya. In Jakarta, some 5,000 personnel from the National Police, the Indonesian Military (TNI) and the Jakarta Public Order Agency (Satpol PP) gathered at the National Monument in Central Jakarta on Wednesday. They were part of 18,000 personnel being readied ahead of the rally. National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian and TNI commander Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo attended the briefing to signal the level of attention they are giving the issue, as the threat of violence continues to loom. Several personnel from the West Java Police were also seen at the ceremony wearing white Muslim caps and clothing over their police attire. They are to be deployed at the forefront of the rally. Tito said the meeting was primarily intended to ensure that the personnel were ready to secure the capital for the upcoming gubernatorial election, but highlighted the Nov. 4 rally as a phase of the campaign that could potentially “create violence”. “It is different in Jakarta, where citizens are now becoming polarized and have their own interests,” Tito told reporters after the meeting. He said he hoped the rally would run “smoothly and peacefully”, adding that police personnel set to secure the rally would not carry guns or live bullets, and would instead be equipped with non-lethal weapons such as water cannons and tear gas. “We have prepared [all of the measures] just in case [there is a riot], you know. We always think of the worst scenario,” Tito said.

"Tue, November 1, 2016","Jokowi, Prabowo call for calm ahead of rally","The mood was jovial. When asked to ride a horse, a sturdy stallion called Salero, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo amused his host, Gerindra Party chairman Prabowo Subianto, with a typical self-deprecating joke. “This is a very big horse and I am very light. I saw the horse giving me a smile,” Jokowi said, referring to his slender physique. “He certainly has one advantage. He is light and horses like light riders,” Prabowo responded affirmatively. Later in the living room of Prabowo’s spacious ranch in Hambalang, Bogor, West Java, the topic of conversation was anything but light. Jokowi visited Prabowo, his former rival in the 2014 presidential election and leader of the opposition camp, to ask him to join in calling on political groups to ease tensions ahead of a Nov. 4 rally organized by Muslim groups. The groups have called for the prosecution of incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja “Ahok” Purnama for alleged blasphemy. The planned rally, a follow-up to a chaotic street protest on Oct. 21, which was spearheaded by the firebrand Islam Defenders Front (FPI), will call for the imprisonment of Ahok for insulting the Quran. If the plan materializes, it would effectively ban Ahok from seeking reelection in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election. FPI leader Rizieq Syihab has called for schools, businesses and government offices to close on Friday, urging people to join the rally. Senior politicians from Prabowo’s Gerindra Party and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), including House of Representatives Deputy Speaker Fadli Zon and outspoken lawmaker Fahri Hamzah, are expected to attend. In a statement after their meeting, Prabowo said he agreed with the President on the need “to maintain unity and guard against those who want to divide the country”. “We are a plural country with many tribes, religions and races. If we have problems, let’s solve them peacefully,” Prabowo said, adding that he shared Jokowi’s concerns about possible security threats at the planned rally. “Among other things, I am concerned about the security developments and I have to deliver my views to him because he is the country’s commander in chief. I am always ready to give input to the government when needed,” Prabowo said. Speaking after Prabowo, Jokowi declined to refer directly to the rally and only said that religious and political leaders should do more to ease tension related to regional elections. “I agreed with what has been said by Pak Prabowo. Religious and political leaders should join forces to cool down the situation,” Jokowi said. Jokowi also said the talk was a follow-up to a meeting in 2014 that took place shortly before he was inaugurated as president. The two politicians met again in January 2015 in the early months of Jokowi’s administration, when the ruling Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) was threatening to withdraw its support from Jokowi’s presidency, following his decision to postpone the inauguration of Comr. Gen. Budi Gunawan, a former aide of PDI-P matriarch Megawati Soekarnoputri, as National Police chief. After his meeting with Prabowo, Jokowi was scheduled to hold talks with several Muslim leaders, asking them to contribute to calls for peace during the simultaneous regional elections in 2017. On Tuesday, Jokowi is scheduled to meet with leaders from Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah, the country’s largest and second largest Islamic organizations, respectively, to discuss the Nov. 4 rally. Political analyst Gun Gun Heryanto of the Political Literacy Institute said Jokowi recognized that tensions had reached such an alarming level that he needed Prabowo to amplify his message. “When the two leaders meet, it usually takes place in situations where political tension is at its highest. From today’s meeting, I see that Jokowi knows well from whom he could seek help to calm down tensions, which result from sectarianism ahead of the Jakarta election,” Gun Gun said. Despite warnings from Prabowo, House Deputy Speaker Fadli said he would not call off his plan to participate in the rally as the meeting between his party chairman and Jokowi had nothing to do with the planned rally or the Jakarta election. “The rally is not about politics, but about law enforcement against Ahok. The President’s meeting with Pak Prabowo is a regular get-together, following Jokowi’s promise in 2014 that he would visit Hambalang,” Fadli said. House Speaker Ade Komarudin, a Golkar Party lawmaker, said the meeting between Jokowi and Prabowo could contribute to easing tensions in the capital. “When two influential elites from two rival parties can sit together, it really helps deliver a message to calm down the current situation, because party members at the grassroots level can easily follow their actions,” Ade said. _________________________ To receive comprehensive and earlier access to The Jakarta Post print edition, please subscribe to our epaper through iOS' iTunes, Android's Google Play, Blackberry World or Microsoft's Windows Store.

Ja'far asked the protesters to carry out “peaceful action”. He also reminded the demonstrators to not be racist. He said the protest was not connected to the upcoming gubernatorial election. The protesters only wanted to express their belief, which was in accordance with the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), which had said that Ahok had committed blasphemy by telling people in Thousand Islands regency not to be “deceived” by a Quranic verse, Surah al-Maidah: 51. The FPI and several other groups said they would march from Istiqlal Mosque to the National Police's Criminal Investigation Department (Bareskrim) office in South Jakarta and ended at City Hall in Central Jakarta. Ahok has apologized for his statement and said he had meant no harm, but the hard-line groups insist that is not enough. (evi)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/10/14/thousands-hard-liners-march-against-ahok.html,ahok,2016

"Tue, August 30, 2016",COMMENTARY: Why AILA is a bigger threat to freedom than the FPI,"The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) — imagine its members roaming the streets of Jakarta, hunting down Playboy magazines and vandalizing cheap liquor stores — may no longer epitomize religious conservatism in Indonesia. Its position has now been taken over by a group of preachers and academics with the exact same agenda but with a much less threatening moniker and, alas, a much bigger chance to achieve what the FPI militants can only dream of. The Family Love Alliance (AILA), which aspires to make the country more “civilized” by “strengthening family values”, is now at the forefront of the conservative movement in the country. Unlike the FPI, which often acts outside or above the law, AILA is exploiting the existing legal system to turn law enforcers into a morality police, so that later they will practically do what the FPI has been doing for years. The group has requested that the Constitutional Court change the definitions of adultery, rape and sodomy in the Criminal Code. The purpose of this judicial review petition is clear: to outlaw any consensual sexual relationship outside of marriage, including same-sex relationships. AILA, which also means “big family” in Arabic, has gained support from academics from prestigious universities, such as the University of Indonesia, the Bogor Agricultural Institute (IPB) and Padjajaran University. Hamid Chalid, a constitutional law professor from UI, for example, testified in the latest hearing at the court, where he argued that the Criminal Code in its current form was “too liberal”, as it was made by the Dutch. “Our country has silently legalized sex outside of marriage, rape of men and sex between same-sex couples,” he told the bench. “Our law has been so liberal because we have allowed it to be like that for too long. Is that what we want?” Rizieq Shihab, the firebrand FPI leader, could have said the same thing, but he is not a law professor. Rizieq obviously lacks the authority to sway the opinions of Constitutional Court justices. Hamid, on the other hand, is a card-carrying constitutional law expert. It is no surprise that some of the Constitutional Court justices seem to agree with what he said. For years, the FPI has been a thorn in the side of democratic Indonesia, but it has always been on the fringe. Many Muslims, even conservative ones, have been alienated by its despicable antics. I have no doubt that if a foreigner asks affluent, educated and conservative Muslims whether the FPI could be the face of Indonesian Islam today, they will quickly say no. But a different answer may come up if they are asked about AILA. The group is mainstream in so many ways. Not only does it have a much more benign moniker and a much more sophisticated social media strategy than a vigilante group like the FPI, it is also supported by the educated, including professors, and is working within the legal corridor. Its stated goal — strengthening families — is so mainstream that its legal move at the Constitutional Court has received the backing of the Indonesian Child Protection Commission (KPAI), which has argued that casual sex should be banned to protect Indonesian children. But this does not mean AILA does not have the same goal as the FPI, which is to create a moralistic, religious state. AILA’s chairman, Bachtiar Nasir, is the secretary-general of the Council of Young Indonesian Intellectuals and Ulemas (MIUMI) and a graduate from the Islamic University of Medina in Saudi Arabia. Bachtiar has long been rallying against homosexuality on religious grounds. “Learn from history. Religion says the Sodomites were cursed by God and were destroyed. We have to believe that there will be an epic disaster if we condone the LGBTs,” he said in reference to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, as quoted by republika.co.id. That said, despite its secular name, the so-called Family Love Alliance is evidently motivated by the same religious zeal as the FPI. The only difference is that they have greater public support, the patience and the know-how to achieve their goals through painstaking, but more effective, legal means. The Constitutional Court, which has leaned toward conservatism in the past few years, has shown indications it will accept at least part of their petition. In any case, they will not stop at the court. The House of Representatives is concurrently deliberating a revision to the Criminal Code, and AILA members have started lobbying legislators to push their agenda. With greater legitimacy, something the FPI is clearly lacking, AILA has become an effective driving force of conservatism and, therefore, a much bigger threat to civil liberties than some random raids by FPI militants every Ramadhan. So maybe you need to save your daily complaints about Rizieq and his minions on Facebook. The culture war between Indonesian progressives and their retrograde rivals has been taken to a whole new level, with the latter now taking the battle from the blogoshpere to the legal sphere. And, be warned, this battle will be decisive.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/08/30/commentary-why-aila-is-a-bigger-threat-to-freedom-than-the-fpi.html,FPI,2016
"Mon, August 29, 2016",FPI breaks up religious discussion in W. Java,"At least 15 members of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) dispersed a religious discussion in Bandung, West Java, on Sunday, as they objected to the presence of an Ahmadiyah follower as one of the speakers at the event. Risdo Mangunsong of the Interreligious Network said the FPI members broke up the event entitled “Discussions on Miriam in the Bible and Al Quran: An Alternative Bridge in Christian-Islam Dialogues”, as it was about to start on Sunday morning. “[...] They had objections because one of the speakers in the discussion was an Ahmadiyah follower,” said Risdo, referring to Taufik Khalid Ahmad, one of three speakers scheduled to present at the event, which was to be held in the auditorium of the Karya Pastoral building. The two other speakers were Risdo and Catholic priest Heredi Suhartono. Risdo said he was earlier contacted by someone identifying himself as Deni who claimed to be a Bandung Police intelligence unit member. According to Risdo, Deni said he was contacted on Saturday by an FPI member who objected to the plan to feature an Ahmadiyah follower at the discussion. “Shortly before the discussion started on Sunday morning, I was phoned by the intelligence officer [Deni] who asked the discussion’s organizing committee to cancel the event. He said it was the FPI that had asked for the cancellation,” said Risdo. He added that several FPI members later arrived at the venue. “They shouted, asking anyone they encountered to show [the way to] the discussion room.” The angry group dispersed after the organizer signed a statement, agreeing to cancel the event.

"Sat, June 18, 2016",Gus Dur's wife iftar event moved after protests by FPI,"An inter-religious breaking-of-the-fast gathering, or iftar, attended by former first lady Sinta Nuriyah Abdurrahman Wahid on Thursday had to be relocated following protests from Islam Defenders Front (FPI) Central Java branch who opposed the event being held in a church in Semarang, Central Java. Sinta, the founder of Puan Amal Hayati, has held the inter-religious event during Ramadhan for the past 16 years, since her time as wife of Indonesia's fourth president the late Abdurrahman Wahid. This was the first time for her to have to relocate the event following protests by a mass organization opposed to having the iftar held in a church, according to Inter-Faith Commission Head of Semarang archdiocese Pastor Aloysius Budi Purnomo as reported by kompas.com. The event was planned to be held in the Raja Ungaran Church on Thursday and was moved to St. Yakobus Zebedeus Church in Pudakpayung, Semarang after objections. However, FPI still opposed the event and it was finally held in Pudakpayung administrative village hall in the afternoon. Budi said in a statement that it was agreed to relocate the event to the administrative village hall. Churchgoers were allowed to welcome Sinta only at the churchyard and there must not be Islamic religious rituals such as prayers, the adzan, or Quran recitals conducted in the church location. The iftar event with Sinta had been planned for weeks and involved several local Muslim figures, said Yanti, 50, a member of the Yakobus Church congregation. The organizers also invited 425 local people, local figures, mosque officials, village officials as well as the church congregation. The relocated iftar event was held without problem on Thursday and was safeguarded by dozens of police and members of Banser, the youth wing of Indonesia's largest Muslim organization Nahdlatul Ulama. Sinta attended the event accompanied by Semarang Mayor Hendrar Prihadi and several local religious figures.

"Sat, June 4, 2016",Protestors warn of rising threat of communist ideology,"Retired military generals and members of several mass organizations claim to have evidence of a rising communist movement in Indonesia and have warned the public of possible threats from the banned ideology. At least 10,000 protesters rallied on Friday outside the State Palace and the Office of the Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister in Central Jakarta, representing groups such as the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), Islamic People’s Forum (FUI), Islam Defender Troops (LPI) and the Communication Forum of Indonesian Veterans' Children (FKPPI), along with several retired Army generals. “We have to defend Pancasila as our national ideology from the threats of the Indonesian Communist Party [PKI] and other ideologies!” retired Army general Kiki Syahnakri shouted at the rally. The protesters claimed that the defunct PKI planned to proclaim its existence in Indonesia and urged people to stand up and fight against the supposed movement. They also blamed foreigners for having a bad influence on society. The rally followed a two-day symposium entitled “Protecting Pancasila from the Threat of the Indonesian Communist Party and Other Ideologies”, held on Wednesday and Thursday at Balai Kartini in South Jakarta. The event, attended by hundreds of retired military generals, aimed to challenge the earlier National Symposium on the 1965 Tragedy that brought together victims, families, human rights activists, academics and state officials to find a resolution to the 1965 communist purge that remains part of the country's dark past. Several people met with Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Luhut Pandjaitan, Education and Culture Minister Anies Baswedan and Indonesian Military chief Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo during the protest to convey their demands. The participants of the anticommunist rally demanded the government include their recommendations in a settlement for victims of the 1965 massacre. ""Don't just take input from [those who] agree with PKI ideology; the government must also accommodate the symposium held at Balai Kartini,"" said FPI leader Muhammad Rizieq Shihab. The rally began after Friday prayers at the Istiqlal Mosque in Central Jakarta, with protesters marching to the National Monument (Monas) and then the State Palace. Human rights activists and members of the public have recently cited several instances of discussions and events on the 1965 mass killings being disrupted, as well as raids on certain books and even T-shirts, amid claims from retired Army generals and hard-liners of the revival of communism in the country. (vps/rin)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/06/04/protestors-warn-of-rising-threat-of-communist-ideology.html,"communist, communism-revival, FPI",2016
"Fri, June 3, 2016",Thousands rally in protest of alleged revival of PKI,"At least 10,000 people representing various hard-line and civil society groups marched to the State Palace on Friday in protest of  what they claimed to be the revival of the defunct of Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). The groups, including the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), Islamic People's Forum (FUI) Pemuda Panca Marga and the Communication Forum of Indonesian Veterans' Children (FKPPI), started their long march after Friday prayers at Istiqlal Mosque in Central Jakarta. Wearing white garb and military-like attire, the protesters held posters as they called for the eradication of communism in Indonesia. ""This is an anti-PKI movement,"" Maman Suryadi, who led the FPI protesters, told the thejakartapost.com. Protesters’ demands included for President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo  to not revoke the 1966 Provisional People's Consultative Assembly (MPRS), which disbanded the PKI and banned anything communism-related, and also banned lessons on PKI in school curriculum. The protest was a continuation of a two-day symposium entitled “Threat of the Indonesian Communist Party [PKI] and Other Ideologies” during which retired military generals and groups discussed threats brought about with the alleged revival of the PKI and ways to protect Pancasila as the state ideology. Tuparjo from Pemuda Panca Marga said the purpose of the rally was to warn the government and public over the rising influence of communism. The protesters also urged the government to be firm on matters related to the PKI. ""Communism and radicalism must not live in this country,"" he said. Members of the Pemuda Panca Marga group take part in a rally protesting an alleged revival of the defunct Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and communism in Indonesia in Central Jakarta on June 3. Around 10,000 people took part in the protest to push for the government to take a firm stance on communism in Indonesia.(thejakartapost.com/Anton Hermansyah) Meanwhile, Arive Bawomo from FKPPI also said that the group's members urged the government to not apologize over the 1965 tragedy as demanded by human rights activists, victims and family of victims of the massacres. The government has yet to find a conciliatory solution for the 1965 communist purge, which is believed to have killed at least 500,000 people suspected to be members or sympathizers of the PKI. Jakarta Police deployed around 3,000 personnel for Friday's rally. Police officers will guard the protest and manage traffic to prevent congestion, said Sr.Cmr. Dwiyono of the Central Jakarta Police.

"Fri, June 3, 2016","Former Army general gets Marxism muddled up, mocked online","A number of retired Army generals this week organized a symposium claiming to protect the country’s national ideology, Pancasila, from the feared revival of communism and other ideologies. However, even the symposium coordinator seems unsure as to the exact nature of the perceived threat. On the first day of the event on Wednesday, retired Army general and symposium coordinator Kiki Syahnakri tried to explain the difference between communism, Marxism and Leninism to journalists during a press conference. He explained that a Marxist must be an atheist because dialectical materialism, the philosophy behind Marxism, was inspired by the ideas of philosophers Aristotle and Plato on the universe’s creation. “Marxism is Aristotelian. So a Marxist doesn’t believe that the universe was created. That is to say, they believe the universe is present in itself,” Kiki said. “So it’s clear that they are atheists as they don’t believe in God.” “On the other hand, Lenin thought that Marxists were too soft. Hence, to implement the ideas, he needed to seize power, he needed to make the revolution.” However, Kiki was contradicted by philosopher and Catholic priest Franz Magnis-Suseno. “Karl Marx’s ideas aren’t related to Aristotle’s, and Aristotle’s ideas aren’t related to atheism,” Franz told The Jakarta Post over the phone. Franz explained that Marxism was Marx’s critique of capitalism that analyzes the mechanisms of change within a society. He also said the main behind Marxism was to see the proletariat overthrow capitalism. The late Soviet leader Lenin added the ideas of the democratic organization of a revolutionary vanguard party and the achievement of a dictatorship of the proletariat, Franz added. “Marx didn’t talk about the revolutionary party. But Lenin focused on the party, not only the theory. Lenin had the idea to manage the revolution, so he created the revolutionaries, called communists,” he said. “So, communism is a combination of Marx and Lenin’s theories.” Kiki’s explanation of Marxism suddenly went viral on social media on Wednesday night after Rappler journalist Febriana Firdaus posted it on her Facebook account. As of Thursday evening, the post had been shared by netizens more than 800 times. Some questioned Kiki's references in making such misleading explanations. “Wow, he has invented a new theory, which is tremendous and super,” Poedjiati Tan commented on Febriana’s post. “Sir, if you are too lazy to read [books], you could have just checked Wikipedia,” said Bonaventura Aditya Perdana. Febriana faced the consequences on Thursday, the second day of the symposium, as she was reportedly barred from covering the event by some participants who claimed to be m embers of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI). “Considering her inconsistent news coverage, foreign media journalist @febrofirdaus was kicked out of the national symposium,” tweeted the official FPI Twitter account @DPP_FPI. Meanwhile, Kiki responded to the development by saying that journalists should report fairly on the symposium. “I advise all journalists to avoid pitting us against each other,” he said. “I regret there have been reports of attempts to bully and bring disunity.” (vps/dmr)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/06/03/former-army-general-gets-marxism-muddled-up-mocked-online.html,"Protecting-Pancasila-symposium, Kiki-Syahnakri, Marxism",2016
"Mon, May 23, 2016","Scholars, government differ on Marxism","Amid intimidation from the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) against scholarly discussions on Marxism, the country’s intellectuals and the government are still arguing about whether the leftist ideology is an acceptable subject for discussion. If the country’s scholars and the government are unable to settle their differences, the FPI’s hostility could become the ultimate winner in this lengthy debate over freedom of expression. Several academics on Sunday called on the government to protect freedom of expression at universities following a series of crackdowns on discussions on Marxism in Bandung and Sumedang, West Java, by the FPI. The FPI dispersed a discussion at the Indonesia Institute of Arts and Science (ISBI) in Bandung on May 10 and a seminar on the same topic at the Padjajaran University (Unpad) in Sumedang on May 19. Despite the crackdown and coercion, the Research, Technology and Higher Education Ministry has washed its hands of the matter, proclaiming Marxism illegal in all universities in the world’s fourth largest democracy. “Marxism cannot be taught because it is not in line with the nation’s ideology of Pancasila,” Intan Achmad, the ministry’s directorgeneral for learning and student affairs, told The Jakarta Post. Responding to that statement, Mukhtasar Syamsuddin, head of Gadjah Mada University’s (UGM) School of Philosophy, said the government should ensure protection for any kind of event on campus, including events at respectable education centers in West Java. “These discussions are within the academic realm. They are not efforts intended to change the nation’s ideology. The government has to provide protection as part of its mandate to educate the whole nation,” Mukhtasar told the Post on Sunday. He said Marxism had been taught at his school since the 2000s, a move aimed at giving his students a complete philosophical perspective. “We are obliged to learn every branch of philosophy, including Marxism, liberalism, pluralism and multiculturalism, because they cannot be critical toward everything without having a holistic comprehension,” he said. In stark contrast to Mukhtasar’s sentiment, Intan said “there is no need to wax nostalgic on the uses of Marxism, for it does not have place anymore in this era”. Nonetheless, renowned scholar Franz Magnis Suseno said Marxism was still a “relevant” subject for discussion, especially in the academic forum, so that younger generations would know why the teaching could not be implemented in the country that uses Pancasila as its governing ideology. “The law only prohibits the dissemination of Marxism-Leninism, based on the now-defunct Indonesian Communist Party, with the intention of changing the country’s founding ideology,” Franz told the Post on Sunday, referring to Article 219 of the Criminal Code. “Marxism is not an ideology. There is a lot of it that is not related to communism, such as Marx’s critical theory of society,” said Franz, a senior lecturer at the Driyarkara School of Philosophy in Jakarta. Franz also raised his concerns over the government’s “inaction” in dealing with the swelling tide of intimidation and intolerance seen in West Java, saying “it is a dangerous threat to freedom of academic expression. This threat is more dangerous than the threat posed by the FPI”. Meanwhile, several academics within the Progressive Intellectuals Forum, including UGM sociologist Arie Sujito, Sanata Dharma University historian Baskara T. Wardaya and Airlangga University political science lecturer Airlangga Pribadi, demanded on Saturday that the government protect freedom of academic expression on campus. Separately, the crackdown on communist symbolism continues as soldiers from the Batanghari base in Jambi apprehended a man, identified as RS, on Saturday for wearing shirt with the hammerand-sickle logo, similar to that of the PKI.

"Sat, May 21, 2016",Bandung gripped with communist fears,"In absence of the State’s assurance for freedom of expression, the nation has continuously witnessed repressive acts against academic freedom within university campuses across the country. While it was the police who halted a number of such academic events in Yogyakarta, lately, similar repression was observed in West Java. The only difference in the latter was that the hard-line group, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), played the role of oppressor. Just on Thursday, the social and political sciences department of Padjajaran University (Unpad) in Sumedang, near West Java’s capital of Bandung, decided to cancel its seminar, entitled “ Marxisme sebagai Ilmu Pengetahuan” (Marxism as science) following intimidation by the FPI. Activist Firman Ekoputra from the Rumah Kiri organization, Unpad political scholar M. Rolip Saptamaji and Unpad political science lecturer Carolina Paskarina were initially scheduled to speak at the seminar. It was the second repressive act in only a week by the FPI against freedom of academic expression in the province. On May 10, the hardliners dispersed Sekolah Marx (School of Marx), an event discussing Marxism conducted by the Daunjati student press group of the Indonesian Art and Culture Institute (ISBI). The FPI demanded Daunjati end the event, but the press group continued with proceedings until last Wednesday, albeit with compromises. Student Council spokesperson of Unpad’s social and political sciences department Muhammad Ariq Andarmesa said the FPI had come to the university, demanding that the university cancel the seminar. “The academic affairs division of my department then asked the students to cancel the event, citing security reasons,” Ariq told The Jakarta Post in an interview on Thursday. He also received various anonymous phone calls, including one claimed to be from police intelligence, telling Ariq to beware as tension with communists was simmering. “This proves the campus, once heralded as an autonomous institution free from outside pressures, is powerless in dealing with threats to its academic freedom,” Ariq said. The department head, Widya Setiabudi, said recommending the student council delay the seminar was aimed to “deal with the simmering tension”. “We wanted to cool down the situation. In the end, we just postponed the event,” Widya said, adding that Marxism was a common subject of campus discussion, given that it was part of the social and political studies course. However, Research, Technology and Higher Education Minister Muhammad Nasir told the Post on Thursday that Marxism was banned in all campuses in the country. “It cannot be taught as a university subject. Every campus has to abide by the law,” Nasir said, adding that Marxism was not in line with core values that embody the “belief in God” principle, outlined in the Constitution. The ministry’s director-general for academic and student affairs, Intan Achmad, said he was unaware that Marxism had become a subject at the university. Meanwhile, National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Boy Rafli Amar said it was the police’s job to handle communist-related events, not the FPI’s. “The FPI should not act as vigilantes toward any event related to communism,” Boy told the Post on Thursday. Separately, Institute for Policy Research and Advocacy (ELSAM) researcher Andi Mutaqqien said Article 219 of the Criminal Code, which stipulates that advocating communism is a crime, was open to interpretation. “Not every seminar on communism intends to advocate the ideology,” Andi said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/05/21/bandung-gripped-with-communist-fears.html,"communist-purge, bandung",2016
"Sat, March 26, 2016",Monologue about Tan Malaka performed under police guard,"The show must go on: Actor Joind Bayuwinanda acts as Tan Malaka in the Tan Malaka monologue 'ÄúSaya Rusa Berbulu Merah'Äù (I'Äôm A Red-furred Fox) at the Institute Francais Indonesia in Bandung on Thursday. The show eventually went ahead after it was delayed due to protests from Islam Defenders Front (FPI). (JP/Arya Dipa) After failing to be staged a day earlier because of pressure from a hardline group, a monologue performance about national hero Tan Malaka was eventually presented on Thursday under tight police guard. Entitled Saya Rusa Berbulu Merah (I Am A Red-furred Fox), the performance was held twice, at 4 p.m. and 8 p.m., in the auditorium of the Institut Francais Indonesia (IFI), the French cultural center, in Bandung, West Java. Performances were previously scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday. Bandung Police chief Sr. Comr. Angesta Romano Yoyol said 200 police personnel were detailed to secure the production. 'ÄúWe also took security measures yesterday, but it was conducted tightly,'Äù Angesta said, Thursday. The police personnel were seen on guard in the yard, cafÃ© and along the lobby heading to the performance venue. No members of the hardline group that previously objected to the performance were seen at the venue. Bandung Mayor Ridwan Kamil was praised for reportedly supporting the show and guaranteeing that it would go on, although he did not go see it himself. On Wednesday, representatives of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) went to IFI at 2 p.m., demanding the organizers cancel the performance over fears that the show would help spread communism. Tan Malaka was a controversial leftist figure who fought for the country'Äôs independence against Dutch colonialists. President Sukarno'Äôs administration named him a national hero in 1963, but the New Order regime under the late authoritarian leader Soeharto decided to minimize Tan'Äôs role, given his ties to the communist movement. Dedi Subu from the West Java FPI said on Wednesday that the group opposed the monologue because it spread communist teachings, and as communism had been banned by law, such an event had to be canceled. Despite having protested against the show, Dedi admitted that he had not read the script provided by the organizers. 'ÄúWhy would I read it? We all know that Tan Malaka was a communist,'Äù he said on Wednesday. The Mainteater group decided to put on a show about Tan Malaka to pay respect to the forgotten hero. The group believed Tan'Äôs ideology is still relevant to Indonesia'Äôs current situation. 'ÄúWe need to learn by example: how Tan Malaka put the country'Äôs interest above his personal and party interests,'Äù Ahda said. The producer of the performance, Heliana Sinaga, said that although not all the seats were occupied during Thursday'Äôs first performance, all the tickets were sold out. The organizing committee sold 180 tickets for each of the performances. Joind Bayuwinanda, who played the character of Tan Malaka, did not seem to be affected by the off-stage tension. For 67 minutes the audience was taken on the journey of the national hero who had to repeatedly adopt different disguises after being arrested by the Dutch colonial administration in 1922. Director Wawan Sofwan set Tan Malaka as the narrator. 'ÄúThe original script by Ahda Imran has been cut from 35 pages to 20 for the performance,'Äù Wawan said. Permata, a member of the audience, said that the performance was rich in dialogue but lacked body language. 'ÄúThe [actor'Äôs] body was less explored. It'Äôs maybe because the dialogue was too long,'Äù she said. She added that the body language of Tan Malaka as an activist who was close to the people could not be seen in the monologue. 'ÄúThe messages through the words were too powerful,'Äù she said. In the show the audience were able to discover Tan'Äôs thoughts about using revolution to get independence, which was not possible through diplomacy, as well as his idealism about getting 100 percent independence. The fear expressed by those who protested the performance, that it was propaganda for communist ideology, was not borne out by what was presented on stage. 'ÄúWe will bring the show to various other regions in Indonesia,'Äù Heliana said. ------------------- To receive comprehensive and earlier access to The Jakarta Post printedition, please subscribe to our epaper through iOS' iTunes, Android's GooglePlay, Blackberry World or Microsoft's Windows Store.

"Thu, March 17, 2016","TIM threatened with growing intervention from police, hardliners","Taman Ismail Marzuki (TIM) located in Cikini, Central Jakarta, has long been a safe haven for artists and activists to express themselves. Officially opened on Nov. 10, 1968, the arts and cultural center saw its heyday in the 1970s when Ali Sadikin governed the capital. Artists and activists alike saw TIM as an oasis to freely express themselves without worry of government intervention, control or restrictions. However, growing conservatism among residents has set off alarm bells that there would be no such luxury. In the last few months, the police have shut down five events representing freedom and diversity. Three of those events were held at TIM. Last November, the police decided not to give the go-ahead for a discussion on terrorism scheduled to be held by the Association of Journalists for Diversity (Sejuk) after the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) expressed its objection to the event'Äôs poster, which depicted the Islamic State movement'Äôs flag next to the FPI'Äôs official logo. A month later, the police canceled a discussion and the reading of a drama script about the 1965 communist purge after the FPI blocked the events, which they said 'Äúharmed nationalism'Äù. More recently, Jakarta Police dispersed the Belok Kiri (Turn Left) Festival, an event to accommodate history enthusiasts, who wanted to share thoughts about leftist political history in Indonesia. The police prevented the festival from commencing after a group of people had showed objection to the event. Jakarta Arts Council (DKJ) chairman Irawan Karseno said that the recent incidents at TIM had left artists disappointed. Irawan said that TIM had, for a long time, facilitated artists to freely express themselves and that the recent incidents posed a threat not only to artists, but also to the cultural center itself. 'ÄúIf the police and the government are limiting freedom of expression and freedom of assembly then we'Äôre back to the New Order era. Currently, there is not much we can do, but we will try to discuss this matter with the relevant officials,'Äù Irawan told The Jakarta Post recently. He said that the DKJ were aiming to meet with Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama, as well as Legal and Security Affairs Minister Luhut Pandjaitan and lawmakers to discuss the recent incidents at TIM, where they seek to plead with the government and the police not to limit artists'Äô freedom of expression and assembly. Irawan, as TIM'Äôs program curator and who has also previously served as an arts advisor to Jakarta'Äôs governor, argued that DKJ is professional enough to determine the programs appropriate for TIM and that intervention by the government or the police, especially to cancel an event was unnecessary. He went on to say that the police should secure TIM from protesters instead of closing down its events. Separately, TIM'Äôs management unit head Imam Hadipurnomo said that the management was responsible for administrative and financial matters within the cultural center. The management is under the Jakarta administration'Äôs Tourism and Culture Agency, and consists of civil servants. Previously, such matters were handled by artists. Imam said that TIM'Äôs management unit this year allocated Rp 23 billion (US$1.72 million) for operations, maintenance and salaries. The management unit this year is also set to conduct their own events in TIM, such as the first Jakarta Anniversary Festival and the annual celebrations to commemorate TIM'Äôs establishment. The allocation was an increase from last year'Äôs Rp 18 billion, he said. Although TIM is administratively managed by civil servants, Imam assured that the city administration gave its full support to the artists. 'ÄúThe DKJ is still responsible for curating programs in TIM. Our job is only to issue permits and manage TIM'Äôs operations. In no way do we intend to limit programs at TIM,'Äù Imam told the Post over the phone.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/03/17/tim-threatened-with-growing-intervention-police-hardliners.html,,2016
"Thu, March 10, 2016",Jakarta race heats up but religion not yet major issue,"It was Friday noon when a middle-aged man walked out from an old office building in Kalibata, South Jakarta, with a blue folder full of papers in his hand. Bagus Mulyono, a worker at the office, said the man was one of dozens of people who had registered themselves as potential Muslim candidates for Jakarta governor in opposition to incumbent Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama, a Protestant. The office, he said, had been used for weeks by the Muslim Forum Secretariat as a registration post. 'ÄúHe forgot to bring some required documents, so I asked him to return tomorrow,'Äù Bagus, training coordinator for the gubernatorial candidates, told The Jakarta Post. Since Feb. 20, the Muslim Forum Secretariat has run a selection process for potential candidates to be endorsed by Muslim groups in the Jakarta gubernatorial election on Feb. 15 next year. The selection process was initiated by a number of Muslim figures including Islam Defenders Front (FPI) patron Habib Rizieq and Fahrurozzi Ishaq, who was 'Äúsworn in'Äù by the Betawi Brotherhood Forum (FBR) in December 2014 as a rival governor. Things have begun heating up with several prominent people declaring their possible candidacy, including politician-cum-lawyer Yusril Ihza Mahendra, music producer Ahmad Dhani and businessman Sandiaga Uno. Ahok has declared he will run as an independent with Heru Budi Hartono, the head of the city'Äôs Financial and Asset Management Board, as his running mate. 'ÄúThe Papuan governor is a Christian, the governor of Bali is a Hindu. So as we are the majority here, Muslims should reclaim the governor'Äôs position in Jakarta as well,'Äù Bagus said. Denying that the movement was exploiting the religious issue for political purposes, he said they were only 'Äúobeying God'Äôs command.'Äù The secretariat has established 135 coordination posts throughout Jakarta and expect to have another 133 within the next few months. 'ÄúWe are looking for the best Muslim candidates,'Äù he said. Around 7 million voters in Jakarta will be eligible to vote in the gubernatorial election next year. Ahok became the governor in November 2014 to replace President Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo, who left Jakarta for the State Palace. Websites and preachers at mosques have urged voters to vote based on the candidate'Äôs religion. Campaigns in a similar vein have also appeared on Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp groups and other social media. However, a survey released by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in January found that religion would not play a significant role in the election as 45 percent of 400 respondents were prepared to vote for Ahok. In November 2014, many Muslims showed their support for Ahok, in response to an FPI campaign to prevent Ahok from being sworn in as governor. Several Muslim groups visited Ahok to offer support while others rallied at Hotel Indonesia Traffic Circle to show that not all Muslims had a problem with a non-Muslim leader. Dharma Rozali Azhar, a Jakarta resident, said he hoped that the election would result in the best candidate for governor, regardless of the candidate'Äôs religion or ethnicity. Dharma considers himself to be a committed Muslim. However, the 27-year-old lawyer believes that mixing religion and politics is problematic. 'ÄúThe country has adopted a separation of powers with three branches: the executive, legislature and judiciary. If you require your leader to be a Muslim, you must apply it in other branches as well, and that could cause difficulties,'Äù he said. He said he was undecided in his choice for the election, but he had problems with Ahok'Äôs tough eviction policy, not his religion. Hamdi Muluk, a political analyst from the University of Indonesia, said the election of Jokowi and Ahok as Jakarta governor and deputy governor in 2012 was solid proof that Jakarta voters could see beyond religious and ethnic backgrounds when choosing their leaders. He said the most important thing in voters'Äô eyes was the candidate'Äôs ability to manage the city and how they responded to problems. ___________________________________ To receive comprehensive and earlieraccess to The Jakarta Post print edition, please subscribe to our epaperthrough iOS' iTunes, Android's Google Play, Blackberry World or Microsoft'sWindows Store.

"Sun, February 28, 2016","Police bow to pressure from hardliners, again","No left turn: Organizing committee chairperson of the Belok Kiri (Turn Left) Festival, Dolorosa Sinaga (center, in white), is comforted by Bambang, an executive of Taman Ismail Marzuki cultural center in Cikini, Central Jakarta, on Saturday as members of the police and a joint Muslim student organization swept the area in order to force the cancelation of the event on Saturday. The event, which was to run until March 5, has been moved to the Jakarta Legal Aid Foundation (LBH Jakarta).(JP/Don) In the latest of several such incidents in the past three months, the Jakarta Police have failed to uphold their impartiality by refusing to protect a small group of people who planned to organize a festival of leftist thinking in Taman Ismail Marzuki (TIM), Cikini, Central Jakarta. The festival themed the Belok Kiri (Turn Left) Festival, was initially set to be held in the TIM cultural center from Feb. 27 to March 5 to accommodate history enthusiasts, who wanted to share thoughts about leftist history in Indonesia. However, on Friday TIM management, the Jakarta Arts Center (PKJ), had a change of heart and decided to withdraw its permission for the event following opposition from various mass organizations, such as Jakarta'Äôs Indonesia Islam Youth Movement, the Jakarta Activist Front and Duta Legal Aid Institute. On Saturday, the police deployed around 200 personnel to disperse the festival'Äôs committee members, who were about to hold a press conference to deliver their response to the on-going opposition, following a demonstration staged by around 50 members of the mass organizations. As a result, the committee eventually held the press conference using a loud hailer in the parking lot of the cultural center, as well as canceling a discussion and a book launch, which had been scheduled for Saturday afternoon. 'ÄúWe will fight back against the opposition by using an intellectual approach, instead of the physical approach that these mass organizations use,'Äù said one of the committee members, Dytha Caturani on Saturday. Dytha further denied allegations by the mass organizations, who claimed that the festival was held to 'Äúhail left-wing ideology in Indonesia'Äù. 'ÄúWe, instead, want to raise critical thinking among the people regarding our history, which has been manipulated by the New Order regime for its political interests,'Äù Dytha said. The committee insisted on proceeding with their plans as they went on to open the event at the office of the Jakarta Legal Aid Institute in Central Jakarta. They also continued with the series of events by means of several improvisations to the schedule, which can be found on their Twitter account @BelokKiri_Fest. Separately, Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Mohammad Iqbal said the police had to stop the event because the committee had not informed the police. Moreover, he added, a brawl could potentially break out between the organizers and the mass organizations if the committee insisted on proceeding without permission from the police. Therefore, the police had to step in. The Belok Kiri Festival is not the first gathering to have been dispersed by the police as a result of pressure from hard-line organizations. Earlier this month, the police bowed to the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) by shutting down a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) group'Äôs closed workshop at the Cemara Hotel in Menteng, Central Jakarta. In December, the police canceled a discussion and the reading of a drama script about the 1965 communist purge after the FPI blocked the events, which they said 'Äúharmed nationalism'Äù. In November, the police decided not to give the go-ahead for a discussion on terrorism set to be held by the Association of Journalists for Diversity (Sejuk) after the FPI expressed its objection to the event'Äôs poster depicting the Islamic State movement'Äôs flag next to the FPI'Äôs official logo. _________________________________ To receive comprehensive and earlieraccess to The Jakarta Post print edition, please subscribe to our epaperthrough iOS' iTunes, Android's Google Play, Blackberry World or Microsoft'sWindows Store.

While Rizieq was not in attendance, he was replaced by his son-in-law Fikri. Hundreds of attendees wearing FPI uniforms were also seen among the congregation.

"Wed, February 10, 2016",Police break up LGBT workshop after complaint,"Police have once again bowed to hardliners at the expense of minority groups and civil society by shutting down an LGBT group'Äôs closed workshop at the Cemara Hotel in Menteng, Central Jakarta. Filing a report to the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) on Tuesday, Yuli Rustinawati, chairman of LGBT group Arus Pelangi, said dozens of Menteng Police officers had disbanded a workshop on access to justice for LGBT communities last week. The police officers said they were deployed to the hotel as soon as they received a report from hardliner group the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). 'ÄúThe officers told us we should secure a permit from the police to hold such an event, otherwise it would be disbanded,'Äù Yuli told The Jakarta Post. She insisted that no regulation stipulated that an event held indoors with fewer than 50 people required a police permit. Based on the National Police chief'Äôs Instruction No. Pol/02/XII/95 on permits and notice of community activities, events that require a permit are music festivals, shadow puppet shows, Javanese theatrical performances and other shows. Arus Pelangi'Äôs event, held between Feb. 1 and 8, was none of those. With the tagline 'ÄúLGBT Rights are Human Rights'Äù, the workshop gathered 26 participants from LGBT groups from eight provinces. On the third day of the workshop, participants and committee members received uninvited guests in five FPI members and a police officer who asked that the event be disbanded immediately as it did not have a permit. 'ÄúWe weren'Äôt committing any crime by holding the event, so we decided to continue,'Äù said Lini Zurlia, the event'Äôs organizing committee and Arus Pelangi member. However, a few hours later around 25 uniformed police officers swarmed the lobby and gave the hotel management no choice but to ask the committee to stop the workshop. Lini said Arus Pelangi decided to change the venue, so the workshop could be finished as scheduled. West Jakarta Police spokesperson Comr. Suyatno said the group should have informed them about the activity, emphasizing that the police did not intend to prohibit such activities. 'ÄúBut as Indonesians, we normally report our activities [to local police], especially if it involves inviting outsiders,'Äù he told the Post. 'ÄúWe would then process the event proposal and see whether or not nearby residents accepted it. Then we would make our recommendation. If something bad happens, who will society blame?'Äù he said. Human Rights Watch Group (HRWG) ASEAN program manager Daniel Awigra lambasted the police'Äôs actions. 'ÄúWhat'Äôs the basis of it? The police are responsible for protecting everyone, regardless of their politics, religion or sexual orientation. The [LGBT community] are not a threat to safety, public order, public health or morals,'Äù he said. Daniel believed that the police'Äôs actions stemmed from society'Äôs tendency to look at everything through a religious lens only, including homosexuality, which has been increasingly perceived as a contagious disease following recent remarks from various public officials and religious leaders. Daniel then pointed out how the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared that homosexuality was not a disease back in 1990. It was not the first time the police have disbanded an event following pressure from certain groups. In November 2015 the Jakarta Police did not give the go-ahead for a discussion on terrorism held by the Association of Journalists for Diversity (SEJUK), as the FPI accused the association of putting up a provocative promotional poster for the event. A month later, the police also pressured the Jakarta Arts Council to cancel a discussion on the 1965 tragedy following a protest from dozens of artists who said that political issues should not be brought up at an arts festival. In December, hundreds of FPI members inspected cars passing through Taman Ismail Marzuki in Central Jakarta where the Indonesia Theater Federation Award was being held. They were trying to stop Purwakarta Regent Dedi Mulyadi from attending the event as they accused him of debasing the tenets of Islamic by using the Sundanese greeting Sampurasun instead of the Muslim-approved assalamualaikum. _____________________________________________ To receive comprehensive andearlier access to The Jakarta Post print edition, please subscribe to ourepaper through iOS' iTunes, Android's Google Play, Blackberry World orMicrosoft's Windows Store.

The move comes after FPI members raided a boarding houses in Bandung where they believed gay people were staying and put up signs requesting that they leave. 'ÄúI have reprimanded the FPI. They admitted what they did,'Äù Ridwan said in a text message forwarded to Reuters by an aide. 'ÄúProvocative banners have to be taken down.'Äù An FPI spokesman was not immediately available for comment. The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community (LGBT) is largely accepted in Indonesia, particularly in urban areas, but pockets of opposition remain. Most recently, a government minister called for a ban on campus-based LGBT organization activities at university. In the conservative province of Aceh, where sharia (Islamic law) is implemented, the LGBT community faces government-sanctioned discrimination, meaning that people can be sentenced to 100 lashes for engaging in gay sex. The FPI have a track record of using violence and is known for harassing Christians and religious minorities such as Ahmadiyah, an Islamic sect. Last year, hundreds of FPI members forced the local government to tear down several churches in the conservative province of Aceh, claiming that they lacked proper building permits.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/01/30/national-scene-mayor-takes-stern-action-against-fpi.html,,2016

During Ba'asyir's second appeal review hearing, several witnesses denied the cleric's involvement in military training in Aceh Besar. (Tempo) Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) leader Habib Riziek said terrorist convict Abu Bakar Ba'Äôasyir was not involved in any military training in Aceh Besar, as had been accused. Riziek admitted that Ba'Äôasyir had been in contact with him, as FPI leader, but that it had been in order to channel humanitarian funds. 'ÄúHowever, overall, the funds given by Ustadz Abu Bakar Ba'Äôasyir were directed to fulfil the interests of Muslim people, including to help Muslims in Palestine, who are suffering amid misery and oppression,'Äù said Riziek, in his testimony at the Cilacap District Court on Tuesday as a witness for the firebrand Muslim cleric in Ba'Äôasyir'Äôs second case review (PK) hearing regarding his alleged terrorism case. Riziek further said that it was a big mistake to say that Ba'Äôasyir had been involved with armed training in Aceh. 'ÄúHe agreed that all Muslims needed to undergo physical exercises and I myself also agreed with that. However, such physical exercises are for the physical strength of the Muslim people, not for terrorism,'Äù said Riziek. He then asked the court'Äôs judge panel to release Ba'Äôasyir, saying that the court had made a mistake sentencing the cleric to 15 years in prison. Riziek was one of five witnesses presented by the Muslim Lawyer team. The four other witnesses were Jose Rizal, a physician, and three terrorist convicts currently imprisoned in Nusakambangan Prison, namely Abdullah Sonata aka Arman Kristianto, Qomaruddin aka Abu Musa aka Mustaqim aka Abu Yusuf aka Hafshoh and Joko Sulistyo aka Zainudin. In his testimony, Qomaruddin claimed that he had been the field coordinator of the armed military training on the Junto trans-highway in Aceh Besar. 'ÄúI was ordered by Dulmatin to lead the combat training, but I didn'Äôt know where the money came from and who supplied the weapons. All I knew was that both the money and weapons were from Dulmatin,'Äù Qomaruddin told the judge panel. His testimony was confirmed by two other witnesses, also terrorist convicts at Nusakambangan. Dulmatin is the terrorist suspected behind the 2002 Bali bombings. 'ÄúI had known Ustadz Abu Bakar Ba'Äôasyir as a cleric, who was firm and consistent in voicing the truth. That'Äôs why I sent a letter to him, asking for a blessing from him, because I felt pressured at that time,'Äù said Qomaruddin, telling the judge panel about his associations with Ba'Äôasyir. 'ÄúI didn'Äôt know whether or not he had given us money [for the military training],'Äù he went on. Around 300 Riziek supporters attended the hearing, which began at 9 a.m and lasted through until the afternoon. Most of the supporters, who wore FPI tshirts, followed the trial from outside the building due to the limited capacity of the hearing room. 'Äú Allahu Akbar , Allahu Akbar [God is great],'Äù the crowd shouted repeatedly throughout the hearing. They also were reported to have shouted harsh words at the panel of judges. Cilacap Police chief Adj Sr Comr Ulung Sampurna Jaya said that around 1,600 police officers, including 500 Mobile Brigade (Brimob) personnel, had been dispatched to secure the trial.

"Thu, December 31, 2015",Police under fire for allowing sweeping FPI raids,"A petition has gone viral on social media demanding the dismissal of Central Jakarta Police chief Sr. Comr. Hendro Pandowo for allowing raids by hard-line Islamic group the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) to disrupt an awards event on Monday. As of 8 p.m. Wednesday, more than 20,000 netizens had signed the petition, which was initiated by Jakarta resident Damar Juniarto through change.org . The petition is entitled Copot Kapolres Jakarta Pusat yang Telah Dukung Sweeping FPI (Fire Central Jakarta Police Chief for Supporting FPI'Äôs Sweeping Raids). 'ÄúI was upset to find the FPI once again holding sweeping raids and, once again, being supported by the police,'Äù Damar, a member of the Indonesia Art Coalition, told The Jakarta Post on Wednesday. 'ÄúI told my friends that we should urge the police to take the side of the wider public, not just a particular group.'Äù Damar said that on Monday evening around a hundred FPI members inspected cars passing through the front gate of Taman Ismail Marzuki (TIM) in Central Jakarta where the Indonesia Theater Federation Award was being held. They asked drivers to open their car windows to check on passengers. According to Damar, the FPI members were trying to stop Purwakarta regent Dedi Mulyadi from attending the event. The FPI has accused Dedi of debasing Islamic tenets by using the Sundanese greeting Sampurasun , instead of the Muslim-approved Assalamualaikum. The organization has also called Dedi a musyrik (polytheist) after he put up statues of Sundanese puppet characters in a number of parks throughout Purwakarta, West Java. Furthermore, the FPI claim that Dedi is married to Nyi Roro Kidul 'Äî a legendary Javanese figure who is known as the Queen of the South Seas 'Äî because he holds an annual parade around Purwakarta using a decorated chariot. These grievances have driven the FPI to try and stop the regent from entering Jakarta, including for Monday'Äôs event, which was guarded by around 200 police officers. Damar further said that the police did not stop FPI members from inspecting the cars. The police, according to Damar, waited idly by and allowed Indonesians to be harassed by the group. Damar said the police even took Dedi 'Äî who had made his way into TIM through another gate 'Äî from the event and took him away from the park for security reasons. This is not the first time the police have bowed down before the FPI. Earlier this month, the group blocked a discussion and a drama script reading about Indonesia'Äôs 1965 communist purge. The reading was also to be held at TIM. The organizers eventually cancelled the event at the request of the police. Responding to the issue, Hendro said that he would accept any reprimand directed against him, including employment termination, if the police found him guilty of having neglected his duties. He emphasized, however, that no sweeping raids had occurred at the event. He said that he could guarantee this because he had joined with the security team due to a tip off. He also denied the allegation that the police had dispersed the event at TIM. 'ÄúWe guarded the event until the end. We did not urge them to cancel it,'Äù Hendro said. Separately, Jakarta Police Chief Insp. Gen. Tito Karnavian lauded Hendro, saying that no raids had taken place at the event. Tito stated that it was unlikely that the police would dismiss Hendro from his position. Meanwhile, FPI member Abdul Majid confirmed the sweeping raids. He said that the raids had been set up to prevent Dedi from 'Äústepping into Jakarta'Äù. He went on to say that FPI members did not undertake the sweeping raids by themselves alone, but had been aided but other Muslim groups from Cikini, Kwitang and Kalipasir. He explained that the FPI and Muslims could no longer tolerate Dedi'Äôs policies. 'ÄúHis policies could encourage people to be musyrik. If he wants peace, he must stop musyrik policies in Purwakarta. He must destroy all the statues,'Äù Abdul said as quoted by tribunnews.com on Monday. Meanwhile, culture expert Radhar Panca Dahana, who acted as one of the judges at the event, said that anyone joining religious groups should not force their own values on others. 'ÄúPlease, stop harassing other people'Äôs values. Civilized countries do not suppress cultures,'Äù Radhar said.

In Gorontalo, many Christians were forced to celebrate Christmas without power due to blackouts lasting for up to nine hours on Thursday and Friday in most parts of the province. Gorontalo regency resident Grace Pricilia said the power outage had disturbed her family'Äôs preparation for the religious holiday. 'ÄúWe had to cook dishes and finish putting Christmas decorations up at our house in the dark,'Äù she told The Jakarta Post on Friday. Maranatha Church leader Deysi Derdanella, of Limboto, Gorontalo regency, said her church nearly had to cancel Christmas services due to the blackout. 'ÄúFortunately, a church congregation member lent us a generator,'Äù she said. The North Sumatra Police'Äôs headquarters also reported that Christmas celebrations in the province, in which one third of the 12 million residents are Christians, went smoothly and peacefully. However, a policeman and a member of the Pramuka scout movement both of whom were manning the Christmas security post in Brandan, Langkat regency, North Sumatra died after being electrocuted on Thursday afternoon. 'ÄúBoth victims were installing a TV antenna at the post when the incident occurred. The antenna accidentally touched a high-voltage power cable and they were electrocuted,'Äù North Sumatra Police'Äôs spokesperson Sr. Comr. Helfi Assegaf said. In Surabaya, East Java, members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) held rallies in several locations in the city on Wednesday, urging companies not to force their Muslim employees to wear Santa Claus clothing during Christmas celebrations in the city. 'ÄúIt'Äôs a peaceful rally. We are reminding them not to force their Muslim employees to wear Santa Claus costumes because it is not in accordance with Islamic teachings,'Äù said East Java FPI head Andry Ermawan. Local authorities in several regions, including Surabaya and Padang, West Sumatra, earlier issued an appeal to employers not to force their Muslim employees to wear Christmas paraphernalia. Christmas this year fell a day after the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad, with both religious celebrations declared national holidays. Christmas celebrations were also reportedly peaceful in a number of regions, such as in Bandung, West Java; Makassar ,South Sulawesi; Pekanbaru, Riau; and Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara. In Kupang, around 200 Muslim youths affiliated with the East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) Anshor Youth Movement provided assistance to safeguard Christmas celebrations in the city, helping police personnel guard several churches. In Central Java, 282 Christian inmates in various prisons also received sentence remissions on Friday. In Bali, 91 inmates at Kerobokan Penitentiary were also sentence reductions, including 14 foreigners, among them Heather Lois Mack and Tommy Schaefer, the US teen couple who murdered Mack'Äôs mother. Both Mack and Schaefer received one month remission. Mack, who is now taking care of her baby in the prison, was sentenced to 10 years, while Schaefer received 15 years.

"Tue, December 1, 2015",Sundanese greeting joke draws criticism,"The recent joke made by the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab deriding a traditional Sundanese greeting while addressing an audience in West Java has continued to trigger mixed reactions. Sundanese cultural observer Mas Nanu Muda said that Rizieq'Äôs denigration of the greeting, sampurasarun, pronouncing it 'Äòcampur racun'Äô (Laced with poison) as a joke, should be pardoned. 'ÄúHe should be forgiven for not understanding the expression,'Äù said Nanu in a sampurasun ruwatan ritual held on the Penjara Banceuy site in Bandung, West Java on Monday. Nanu and his colleague Mbah Jum purposely held the ruwatan, or prayer ceremony, to counter the derision of the sampurasun traditional greeting by those who did not know its meaning he said. 'ÄúSampurasun is part of the Sundanese people'Äôs moral values. Before doing anything, we ask for forgiveness from others,'Äù said Nanu, a dance tutor at the Indonesian Cultural and Arts Institute. Earlier, West Java Siliwangi Youth Force (AMS) leader Noeriy Ispandji Firman said the Sundanese people disliked conflict, but would fight if they felt provoked. Ispandji added that in Sundanese culture, the sampurasun greeting had a polite meaning and was a part of prayer. 'ÄúBut, now it has been mocked by a renowned figure. It'Äôs inappropriate, especially as it was expressed on the Sundanese soil of Purwakarta,'Äù he said. In a seeming coincidence, President Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo opened his speech with a sampurasun greeting when inaugurating the 2015 Nusantara Fruit and Flower Festival at the Bogor Institute of Agriculture in Bogor ,West Java, on Saturday. Earlier, West Java Governor Ahmad Heryawan, a politician from the Prosperous Justice Party also started his address at the festival with a sampurasun. The West Java Police have received a report from AMS and will investigate the alleged violation of Law No. 11/2008 on information and electronic transactions committed by the FPI leader. West Java Police Special Crimes and Intelligence Directorate chief Wirdhan Denny said the police had received the report lodged by AMS on Nov. 24, in which they allege Rizieq violated the aforementioned law by insulting a particular ethnic group in a video that was uploaded to Youtube on Nov. 15. The case is believed to have come to light following Purwakarta Regent Dedi Mulyadi'Äôs circular guaranteeing freedom of faith in his jurisdiction. The circular was supposedly in response to the launch of the National Anti Shia Alliance (ANAS) in Purwakarta a few weeks ago. Despite the issuance of the circular, the organizers still held a ceremony inaugurating the ANAS leadership board in Purwakarta regency. Rizieq has denied the claims that he mocked Sundanese, accusing the regent of trying to replace the Islamic greeting with the ethnic greeting. 'ÄúSampurasun , in the Sundanese tradition, has a very good meaning, and it can be used as a respectful greeting, as long as it does not replace the Islamic greeting of assalaamualaikum,'Äù he said as quoted by tribunnews.com. He said that sampurasun should not become a means of contention between local customs and Islamic Sharia as each of them had its own unique usage and respective time and place. According to Rizieq, Dedi had begun to omit the Islamic greeting and had been replacing it with the Sundanese traditional greeting, which he claimed was an effort to separate the Sundanese tradition and Islam. Dedi also responded to another of Rizieq'Äôs comments made in one of his sermons in Purwakarta, in which he claimed Dedi had committed syirik, or polytheism, by marrying the supernatural figure Nyi Roro Kidul, a mythical figure who is believed to rule the Southern Ocean. In response to the claims, Dedi just shook his head, laughed and jokingly asked Rizieq to prove the matter.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/12/01/sundanese-greeting-joke-draws-criticism.html,,2015
"Sat, November 28, 2015",Event nixed amid FPI pressure,"Bowing to pressure from the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), the Jakarta Police decided on Friday not to give the go-ahead for a discussion on terrorism scheduled for Saturday. Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Mohammad Iqbal confirmed on Friday that the FPI had taken issue with the Association of Journalists for Diversity'Äôs (Sejuk) decision to put up a provocative poster advertising the event. The poster depicted the Islamic State (IS) flag next to the FPI'Äôs official logo. 'ÄúSo the committee made a poster that the FPI protested because it had a photo of the IS flag and the FPI'Äôs logo next to each other. So we facilitated a mediation between Sejuk and the FPI to prevent any possible security issues,'Äù he told The Jakarta Post. Iqbal said that following the meeting, a deal was struck for the event to be dropped. 'ÄúWe then received news that there was no longer a problem and that the committee had apologized. We also got word that the committee then canceled the event,'Äù Iqbal said. In a statement on Friday evening, Sejuk said that it was disappointed with the police force'Äôs move, which it deemed to have failed to provide safety to the public and protect freedom of speech. 'ÄúSejuk is concerned that pressure and censorship of this sort will make the discussion of religion, an issue perceived to be sensitive, taboo and best avoided. Sejuk recognizes that law enforcement is more likely to censor discussions with themes that it perceives as sensitive,'Äù the association said in the statement. Sejuk also said that the organization had promoted events that could help the government and security authorities. 'ÄúSejuk'Äôs activities, which include discussions, workshops and other events have always supported the government, especially the police because we discuss ways to handle radicalization and increase tolerance.'Äù One of Sejuk'Äôs members, Andy Budiman, said that the organization had agreed to design a new poster for the event but insisted against apologizing to the FPI. Andy emphasized that 'Äúwe are not saying that the police had banned [the event] but we are disappointed that the police force could not guarantee that the event would be able to take place,'Äù he said, as quoted by kompas.com. The discussion was expected to feature Tempo chief editor Arif Zulkifli and terrorism expert Sydney Jones. However, Iqbal vehemently denied that the police had pressured Sejuk to cancel the event by making a thinly veiled threat that they could not guarantee the participants'Äô safety if the FPI decided to disrupt the discussion. 'ÄúAs I have already said, the committee canceled the event on its own initiative,'Äù he said. Meanwhile, deputy chairman of the FPI'Äôs central board, Ja'Äôfar Shodiq, claimed that he had no knowledge of the complaint made by the organization'Äôs Jakarta branch. However, he said that it was completely legitimate for FPI Jakarta to express its grievances against the poster as it was offensive and insinuated that the FPI had connections to IS. 'ÄúIf they want to discuss radicalism then they should just stick to that, don'Äôt drag the FPI into it. Don'Äôt just use people'Äôs logos. The use of our logo next to an IS flag just goes to show that they think we are one and the same,'Äù he said. Ja'Äôfar acknowledged that the FPI did use flags that had Islam'Äôs holiest phrase, 'ÄúThere is no God but Allah'Äù inscribed on them, as the IS flag does, but this did not mean Sejuk could draw a parallel between the two organizations. 'ÄúThe [phrase] belongs to all Muslims and can be used by any of us,'Äù he said, adding that, 'Äúit is totally justifiable that the Jakarta branch made the complaint. Although [the central board] only observes their activities, we approve of it as it shows that they care about their organization.'Äù The FPI is known to conduct raids on entertainment venues, including nightclubs and small food stalls, with some having turned violent in the past. A number of FPI activists in East Java, who often stage 'Äúhate speech'Äù rallies against minority groups, are reportedly now flocking to Syria to join IS.

"Thu, November 26, 2015",Assalamualaikum shouldn'Äôt be replaced with traditional greeting: FPI's leader,"Rizieq Shihab. (Tribunnews/Herudin) Rizieq Shihab, the leader of the Islamic Defender's Front (FPI), has argued that Islam's traditional greeting should not be replaced with a traditional Indonesian greeting following reports that he allegedly insulted Sundanese culture. Rizieq said on Wednesday that he asked the Sundanese people to think more clearly in understanding his remarks. He acknowledged that sampurasun (please pardon me) was a known traditional greeting in Sunda culture. ""Sampurasun has a very good meaning and can be used to greet [others] as long as it does not replace assalamualaikum [peace be with you],"" he said as quoted by kompas.com. Rizieq hoped that Sundanese traditions would not be put up against Islamic traditions Rizieq said that each greeting had its own place and purpose. The FPI leader criticized Purwakarta regent Dedi Mulyadi who, according to Rizieq, had begun to replace assalamualaikum with sampurasun. In response to Rizieq, Dedi said that Islamic and Sunda culture had values that could serve as guidelines to order people's way of living. ""Assalamualaikum and sampurasun are related to one another,"" he told kompas.com on Thursday. Dedi said that the two greetings should not compete against each other because they had different dimensions. ""I have always said assalamualaikum followed by sampurasun at many events,"" he said. In a video uploaded to video-sharing website YouTube, Rizieq changed sampurasun into campur racun (mixed poison) during a sermon he gave earlier this month in Purwarkarta, West Java. The remarks angered Sundanese people as the traditional greeting carries with it a profound meaning. Sundanese society groups, the Sundanese People's Alliance and the West Java Siliwangi Youth Wing, reported Rizieq to the West Java Police on Monday following his remark. Members of the groups urged Rizieq to openly apologize to the Sundanese people and barred him from coming to the West Java area.

"Fri, November 13, 2015",Diponegoro University forbids discussion on LGBT issues,"LGBT: Members of the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) Jakarta group hold up a rainbow flag at City Hall in Central Jakarta on World Peace Day on Sept. 20. (Kompas.com) The rector of State Diponegoro University (Undip) has forbidden students from holding a discussion on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LBGT) issues on campus claiming that the theme was contrary to religious teachings. Rector Yos Johan Utama said on Friday the topic was sensitive and he was worried that it would steer participants in the wrong direction. According to Yos, the notion of LGBT went against religious teachings. 'ÄúUndip upholds religious values and akhlakul karimah [good deeds],'Äù he said on Friday as quoted by tempo.co. Yos also said that the discussion was cancelled because the students had not received permission from the Dean. The Student Press Association (LPM) Gema Keadilan from Undip's faculty of law had to cancel the discussion on Thursday after failing to acquire a permit from campus authorities. In his defense, Yos said the university upheld academic freedom only on the condition that it was conducted responsibly. LPM Gema Keadilan regularly holds discussions on various subjects and the LGBT-themed discussion would have been their sixth event. The students invited three guest speakers for the discussion: Yosep, chairman of the Semarang Gay Community, Marten Hanura, a human rights professor from Undip'Äôs faculty of social and political sciences, and Zulfa Juniarto, a professor from the faculty of medicine. The chairman of the Central Java Indonesian Legal Aid and Human Rights Association (PBHI), Kahar Muamalsyah, condemned the university for the prohibition. ""This is ironic. An academic institution forbidding its students from engaging in critical thinking on an issue,"" he told tempo. Kahar said the prohibition was a misguided attempt at moral judgment. Kahar urged Undip to respect and encourage freedom of expression from its student body. He also called on the police to uphold the state'Äôs responsibility to protect the rights of citizens. The Islamic Defenders'Äô Front (FPI) of Central Java disagreed with the ban. Head of the advocacy team for Central Java FPI Zainal Abidin said, as quoted by tempo.co, that the discussion would help produce fruitful outcomes by revealing the main problems surrounding LGBT people. The problems included the basic reason for the existence of such people, why Islam forbid them and whether economic factors were involved. 'ÄúFreedom of discussion is protected under the law. Students have the right to continue their discussion,'Äù Zainal Abidin said. Nonetheless, in line with the Undip'Äôs stance on free speech, Zainal warned that the FPI would ban any kind of discussion that expressed support for LGBT people.

"Mon, May 6, 2013",Mob ransacks Ahmadiyah village,"No one was injured as unknown assailants attacked an Ahmadhi hamlet in Tenjowaringin village in Tasikmalaya, West Java, early on Sunday morning. 'ÄúThere were no fatalities. Only windows and doors were damaged,'Äù Dodi Kurniawan, a spokesman for the Ahmadiyah community in Tenjowaringin, said over the telephone on Sunday. Members of the minority Muslim sect were a majority in Wanasigra hamlet, where they comprised 95 percent of the local population, Dodi said. Tenjowaringin was 80 percent comprised of Ahmadhis, he added. According to the spokesman, 29 buildings were damaged in the attack, including a mosque, a mushola (small mosque) and an elementary school. The attacks were apparently connected to a meeting of the local branch of the Indonesian Ahmadiyah Congregation (JAI) on Friday and Saturday that was attended by 2,700 Tenjowaringin residents, Dodi said. Tasikmalaya Police chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Wijonarko said that the meeting, which was conducted under guard by police, ended after ashar prayers in the late afternoon on Friday and resumed on Saturday. 'ÄúThe activity stopped after dzuhur on Saturday, Wijonarko said, referring to noon prayers. 'ÄúPeople who were against Ahmadiyah, however, got information saying that the activity was still going on.'Äù Police met members of the mob, who descended on the hamlet from outside Tasikmalaya around 1 a.m. on Sunday to ensure that the meeting had ended, according to the police chief. 'ÄúWe prevented the mob from vandalizing the village. When they found out that the gathering had indeed stopped, the mob responded by throwing stones,'Äù Wijonarko said. Dodi said the attack on the community had gone on for about 15 minutes. 'ÄúBut it seemed that there was someone giving the commands.'Äù The Ahmadhi spokesman said that police officers on scene did nothing to stop the rampage and that no one had been evacuated after the attack. The incidence of violence directed at followers of Ahmadiyah has been more frequent after the issuance in March 2011 of a provincial regulation banning Ahmadiyah activities in West Java. Some mainstream Muslims have deemed Ahmadiyah a heretical sect for its belief that founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was a prophet. Contacted separately, liberal scholar Ulil Abshar Abdala and former first lady Sinta Nuriyah Wahid paid a visit on Sunday to Al-Misbah Mosque in Bekasi, West Java, where 19 Ahmadiyah followers have been barricaded for more than a month. The mosque was sealed on April 4 by the Bekasi municipal administration, which justified its actions using the 2011 gubernatorial regulation and a 2008 joint ministerial decree that banned members of Ahmadiyah from propagating their beliefs. 'ÄúThe Constitution says that each citizen has the freedom to practice their beliefs or religious faith without any pressure or violence and the state has to protect this freedom. Unfortunately, reality speaks otherwise,'Äù Ulil told The Jakarta Post over the telephone. Ulil said that Bekasi was an area where the number of radical religious groups had increased rapidly, potentially threatening the rights of the adherents of minority religions. Sinta blamed the ministerial decree for what had happened to Ahmadis. 'ÄúThe decree says that the state does not ban Ahmadiyah'Äôs followers but limits their practice. People mostly use this argument to prohibit Ahmadis from practicing their belief,'Äù she told the Post over the phone. According to the security coordinator of the Bekasi congregation, Ahmad Maulana, the Ahmadis will stay at the mosque until the administration lifts the seal. 'ÄúWe believe the seal is against the law because there has been no such order from the court,'Äù he said.

"Sun, May 5, 2013",By the way ... Why I am not an FPI member 'Ä_ or a hipster ?,"When I was a kid, I always dreamed of becoming a great jihadist. I grew up in the 1990s when early supporters of the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) were considered cool. That was before I went to college, during which I thought that being a leftist activist carrying Frans Magnis Suseno'Äôs Karl Marx and shouting about socialism was even cooler. That was way before I thought skimming through David Foster Wallace'Äôs notoriously long and hard-to-read novels on my HTC (iPhone is so mainstream!) on the train was much cooler. And that was way, way before I cursed myself for secretly being an insufferably pretentious guy and realized that hipsters and members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) are basically the same. Yes, I just compared a group of youngsters who brag about how great the latest Efek Rumah Kaca'Äôs project is with a group of hard-liners that some people hate with a burning passion. It all began with a simple question: Why am I not a Muslim fundamentalist? Growing up in the 1990s, I had all the reasons to become an angry Muslim militant. When I was 10 years old, I was horrified by the killings of Bosnian Muslims. The firebrand preachers in my neighborhood told me that Christians were trying to proselytize the country and what was happening then in Bosnia could have happened here. What an effective way to terrorize an adolescent. My relatives were members of the underground tarbiyah movement, the progeny of the PKS. Some of my friends were Indonesian Islamic State (NII) activists who recruited new followers like pushy salesmen, only scarier and always quoting God'Äôs words to freak you out. I always thought that it was my decision to study at the State Institute for Islamic Studies (IAIN), which made me abhor religious bigotry. It was probably great thinkers like Cak Nur, Aldous Huxley or Mohammed Arkoun who destroyed my belief that Islam was a fixed concept and constantly under attack. It turned out that I was wrong. I realized I was never a bigot even when I was so engrossed in Islamic activism. I was never committed to one Islamic organization simply because I hated most of them. The Islamic movement has always been fragmented. They are always competing with each other. Most think they are more Islamic than their peers or that the other groups are no different from 'Äúthe infidels'Äù. It was that kind of attitude that stopped me from joining the likes of the FPI. They think they are holier than you. It is not because I oppose their opinions about Islam 'Äî they are entitled to their opinions. I don'Äôt care if they believe Tinker Bell is real. I really don'Äôt think the Liberal Islam Network (JIL) is more sensible than the PKS either. As long as they'Äôre still quoting a 1,500-year-old scripture, I do not expect any of them to be sensible. The reason why I dislike militants is because they are judgmental and arrogant. Some of my ikhwan and akhwat friends used to label me as ammah, which roughly means layman. It was very annoying. I have outgrown those militants, only to learn that such an attitude is not exclusive to religious fanatics. This is a disease that corrodes humanity. Bigots, in different forms, are everywhere. Some call (explicitly or implicitly) themselves 'Äúhipsters'Äù and they refer to people who are not like them as 'Äúmainstream'Äù 'Äî which is just another word for ammah. There is nothing more excruciating than talking to a person who sees you as nothing but a mindless crowd for liking ST12 (now Setia Band) and for not ever having heard Jeff Buckley'Äôs rendition of Leonard Cohen'Äôs 'ÄúHallelujah'Äù. I didn'Äôt know that having bad taste was a cardinal sin. Then you have breastfeeding fathers who scold you for killing your baby with baby formula. Breastfeeding fathers, you ask? If you surf the Internet, you will learn about these fathers who consider themselves responsible for making sure that babies are well breastfed. This is okay, as long they don'Äôt say that moms and dads who have to make money and leave their kids with a sitter are psychopaths. Don'Äôt get me started on vegans and the nature-loving middle class who stare at you for taking the elevator. I know, life would be much easier if we just stopped caring about what others think. I am writing this simply because I need closure and because I know that I can'Äôt possibly be the only one with these opinions. Seriously, religious or secular bigotry, they are equally annoying. But I suppose we all have to get used to it. 'Äî Amir Hamzah",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/05/05/by-way-why-i-am-not-fpi-member-or-a-hipster.html,,2013
"Sat, May 4, 2013",Bomb plot linked to known cells,"Human shield: Police guard the Myanmar Embassy in Jakarta against a protest on Friday. The counterterrorism squad seized five homemade bombs and arrested two men who allegedly planned to attack the embassy in protest at the treatment of Muslims in Myanmar. (AP/Dita Alangkara) The National Police expanded their search on Friday for other terror suspects believed to be behind a plot to attack the Myanmar Embassy. The attack is thought to be in response to sectarian conflict in Buddhist-majority Myanmar that has cost the lives of many members of the Muslim minority community. Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Boy Rafli Amar said counterterrorism squad Detachment 88 were intensively questioning Sefa Riano, 22, and Achmad Taufiq, 29, who were arrested late on Thursday, about their network. The two were arrested while travelling by motorbike in a busy residential area near Jl. Sudirman, Central Jakarta. Boy said a backpack containing five primed home-made pipe bombs was found at the scene. 'ÄúWe'Äôre still digging deeper into their motives and to ascertain whether they intended to bomb the Myanmar Embassy or somewhere else,'Äù said Boy. 'ÄúInvestigations are also ongoing to determine whether they have connections to other terrorist groups,'Äù he said. Sources at the National Police said the suspects were believed to have links with a terrorist cell that planned attacks on US interests in Jakarta and Surabaya in December. The police arrested 11 terror suspects, allegedly led by Abu Hanifah, in Jakarta, Surakarta in Central Java and Madiun in East Java. The group was planning to attack the US Embassy in Jakarta, the US Consulate in Surabaya, East Java and the headquarters of US-based goldminer PT Freeport Indonesia in Jakarta. The police found explosive devices made from the highly volatile nitroglycerin explosive substance. Terror suspect Badri Hartono, who was detained in September in Surakarta for planning to attack a shopping mall, is believed to belong to the same group. The Myanmar-plot cell is also linked to the Abu Omar group that operated in Surakarta and Cirebon, West Java. Several members of the cell, which targeted the police, government officials and the Singapore Embassy, have been convicted while others are still awaiting trial. 'ÄúI believe the two suspects [in the Myanmar plot] have connections with the Abu Omar network, and probably with the Abu Hanifah cell as well,'Äù said terrorism expert Robi Sugara of the Barometer Institute. Robi said the Abu Omar cell had announced that avenging the anti-Rohingya attacks was their priority. The Rohingya are a Muslim ethnic group that has long been subject to persecution in Myanmar. 'ÄúThe violence against the Rohingya has angered the terrorist groups,'Äù said Robi. The police were on high alert on Friday, deploying around 2,000 officers as hundreds of protesters from the hardline Islam Defenders Front (FPI) marched to the Myanmar Embassy to vent their rage over the sectarian conflict. The protesters, dressed in white, held banners that read: 'ÄúWe want jihad'Äù, and 'ÄúStop genocide in Myanmar'Äù. 'ÄúAnyone mistreating Muslims should be killed. Our Muslim brothers and sisters are being attacked in Myanmar 'Äî they are being raped and murdered,'Äù said the protesters'Äô leader and FPI chairman Habib Rizieq, who has justified violence by his followers in the past. Indonesia, the world'Äôs largest Muslim-majority nation, has waged a campaign against radicalism and terrorism since the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people, including foreign tourists. The authorities have detained more than 700 suspected terrorists and accomplices, and killed more than 65. The country has not witnessed any major attack since 2009 when terrorists linked to al-Qaeda offshoot, Jamaah Islamiyah, attacked the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta, killing seven people and seriously injuring dozens.

"Fri, October 23, 2015",Issue of the day: Sandal maker sued for blasphemy,"Oct. 17, p5 A Muslim organization has reported a local footwear manufacturer to the East Java Police for sacrilege for producing sandals embossed with the word Allah. The report was submitted on Thursday despite a public apology PT Pradipta Perkasa Makmur made earlier this week. 'Äú[The company] has violated the law on blasphemy and the legal process must continue,'Äù Islam Defenders Front (FPI) East Java branch head Haidar Al-Hamid said as quoted by tribunnews.com. Pradipta Perkasa Makmur has been in the spotlight after people reported they had found the word Allah, written in Arabic, embossed on the sandals made by the company. Your comments: Could be worth a bit of money as a collector'Äôs item if you can get your hands on a pair. Devanagari Sandals or crosses are all just symbols that have no religious value at all. Why waste your time on such a matter? Why don'Äôt we learn from the European, Japanese, Chinese and American people who work very hard night and day to create good things for mankind? I believe God loves them more because they work so hard to help those hundreds of millions of our brothers and sisters who are hungry, jobless and poor. Robby Kaware There is a misunderstanding. The producing company expected to get good business by patenting sandals with the world Allah, a very sacred and respected word for Muslims. The problem is that the position or location of the word should not be down, close to the feet. This will be translated as humiliation or sacrilege. It would be different if the word were located in a more fitting place. I am sure the company doesn'Äôt have any other purpose than profit. Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), Indonesia'Äôs largest Muslim group, should intervene. Hartono The ironic thing is that the sandals, which to them are sacred because they are embossed with the word Allah, were then burned to destroy them! Tempodulu Blasphemy this and blasphemy that. FPI, you yourself are a great example of blasphemy. Milovalderrama Islam doesn'Äôt teach people to burn churches. Muslims who burn churches are not real Muslims. Ngikngokk The insecurity of the Wahhabi mob seems almost designed to embarrass itself. Surely such a great god doesn'Äôt require burning of churches or blasphemy laws. Moderate Islam in Indonesia would be well served to avoid such disastrous associations and stick to the Constitution. Joyoboyo Alcohol is freely available in Indonesia. You only have to look in the right places. The government knows this, but introduces stupid laws against it to appease the FPI and their ilk. Meaussie Alcohol is mostly out of reach for common people because of the high taxes imposed on it. You have to go to the 'Äúright place'Äù 'Äî and spend the 'Äúright amount of money'Äù. NN Our Muslim brothers could die from alcohol poisoning! Keris Pusaka It'Äôs actually easier now to buy alcohol at supermarkets 'Äî they'Äôve opened up alcohol stalls near the cashiers. Back when minimarts still sold beer, supermarkets didn'Äôt bother having dedicated alcohol sections. A couple of years ago the manager of the local Kickers shoe factory was arrested as his company used pig'Äôs leather on the inner side of some of their shoes. At that time an overly pious client who had bought a pair of these 'Äúoffending'Äù shoes and somehow ascertained that the inner sole was made of pig leather went to the local Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) branch. The MUI in turn went to the police and as a result the manager was arrested. The reason given for the arrest was that the shoes lined with pig leather were not marked as non-halal (or haram 'Äî I forget what it really was) and therefore the factory had purposefully offended good Muslims. Gordon Freeman Most Muslims forget that it is only pig meat they cannot eat. The rest has nothing to do with Islam. But most Muslims are offended by anything they don'Äôt know or understand. A friend from the Netherlands told me a story that a local bank had pulled piggy banks as gifts to new customers because it would offend Muslim customers. Nobody touches my piggy bank that I keep as a souvenir from the time I studied there! Muslims should seek understanding instead of offense. If you don'Äôt like European traditions then why are you there? KP Such an outrageous intentional act cannot be classified as a 'Äúmistake'Äù. Embossing the Almighty'Äôs name on sandals is unacceptable, and the factory management, director and staff are responsible. It'Äôs not possible all factory management and labor staff were non-Muslims. The public outcry should lead to the factory being shut down. Wadata I think the entire management as well as all workers at this factory (and possibly all their trading partners and customers who dared to buy those shoes and walk on the name of Allah) should be arrested and regardless of their religion and race punished by sharia (which probably involves the amputation of their right hand and blinding) and afterwards they should be handed over by authorities to the righteous FPI to receive people'Äôs justice. For the sandals themselves 'Äî they can of course not be destroyed since they bear the name of Allah and destruction would mean destroying the name of the most merciful.

If Indonesia'Äôs commitment is to allow extremist groups such as the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) and others to strike fear in people, run them from places of worship, hold road blocks and try to destroy Indonesian culture, with the support of the police, then surely it is 100 percent committed to radicalism.

Following the identification of two perpetrators on Thursday'Äôs blasts and shootings in Jakarta, both of whom were former terror convicts, Lukman admitted that the government faced shortcomings and challenges in the face of terrorism. 'ÄúWe do not feel we have failed. Deradicalization problems are bound to happen; the challenges only expand. This is a complicated issue,'Äù Lukman said on Sunday. 'ÄúWe are aware there are things that need to be addressed, deficiencies that need to be covered.'Äù Your comments: What contributes more toward deradicalization efforts is the government'Äôs willingness to tackle different social issues such as poverty, inequality, improving healthcare, etc. One of the most crucial (but often forgotten) factors in why more people are drawn to join radical groups is undeniably poor living conditions. The government has proven that it is inept when it comes to solving social issues. Inequality is on the rise, lots of people are barely able to have food each day, millions live in shacks across the country, basic education is still an expensive luxury for most, etc. While all this is happening, public officials and legislative members have luxurious lifestyles. No wonder it'Äôs easier to brainwash individuals who are attracted to join radical groups whose goal is very simple 'Äì destroy the very fabric of society. Simba1991 From the article: 'ÄúTwo of the four perpetrators of the terror attacks in Central Jakarta 'Äî which killed seven people, including the attackers 'Äî were identified as recidivist terrorists.'Äù No kidding? It seems to be a trend that terrorists are captured, given some sort of other indoctrination to 'Äúfix'Äù them and then are either released into mainstream society or given years in prison to infect others. Executed criminals cannot engage in recidivism nor influence others to commit similar atrocities. Daninaceh Until the US hits FPI headquarters with a drone strike, the Indonesian government will pretend they don'Äôt exist. Abdul Malik 'ÄúNot necessarily because the security officers were ineffective, but could be because other factors made the burglary possible'Äù. And that, Minister Luhut, is the job of the government to ensure the 'Äúother factors'Äù are not in place to allow the burglary, or terrorist acts! So, the deradicalization/soft approach is a failure fueled on by the government'Äôs continued support of radical groups such as the FPI! Will It'Äôs wrong. Your predecessors in Indonesia were Buddhists and Hindus. Islam is a modern invader. JLC Hinduism as practiced in Bali is so remarkably different from that in the Indian homeland that there might be some case for describing it as an indigenous religion. That being said, I'Äôve never found the Balinese to be any more moral than other Indonesians 'Äî in fact, they often seem considerably less so. Although I'Äôd probably blame that on the effects of mass tourism rather than religion. Devanagari There'Äôs a lot of 'Äúdrift'Äù from the source with Balinese Hinduism. Not all Hindus are polytheists, but when the faith was introduced they probably were mostly polytheists, and I think the local population simply did what a lot of polytheists or animists do when they encounter new gods; they included them with what they were doing at the time. Of course, they did the same thing with Islam. The perception is that those who proclaim amorality are hypocrites, but I suppose that'Äôs easy to say when you have no sort of code or compass to go by. How can you be a hypocrite if you have no standards? 'ÄúImmoral'Äù behavior, or at least self-destructive hedonism, should be addressed by some sort of personal code or ethics. Some people express this through religion, others through tradition, others by societal expectations and still others by adhering to a personal philosophy. I can'Äôt really speak to whether or not the local Balinese are lacking 'Äúmoral compass'Äù, but it isn'Äôt something you can blow off. There does have to be some kind of cohesion. Danin Implement harsher treatment of suspected terrorists before they perpetrate any acts of terror. Also a strong commitment to combat radical thoughts that align with IS and people like the FPI Betawi Brotherhood Forum (FBR), etc. should be combated through disallowing ustadz (Islamic teachers) and imams who spread such hate.

The incidents have dashed the hopes of a better capital, safe for all, that were raised with last June'Äôs inauguration of the new Jakarta police chief, Insp. Gen. Tito Karnavian, the former counterterrorism unit chief. Together with no-nonsense Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama it was expected that the Big Durian could at last have a professional police force. Yet only last week police disrupted a workshop of Arus Pelangi, an advocacy group for lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in a Central Jakarta hotel, attended by 26 delegates from eight provinces. The police met with organizers of the workshop accompanied by members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), a hard-line group with a record of violence and legal violations. West Jakarta Police spokesperson Comr. Suyatno said police did not ban the workshop, but that organizers should have submitted a proposal for police consideration 'Äî which would include assessment as to whether the event would be 'Äúacceptable'Äù to local residents.

Last November the Jakarta Police did not allow a talk on terrorism organized by the Association of Journalists for Diversity (Sejuk). The police said the FPI was offended by the function'Äôs poster, in which the FPI logo was pictured next to the flag of the Islamic State (IS) movement. The poster depicted a rally of FPI, purportedly in solidarity with Palestine, where a black flag similar to that of IS was displayed. Last December two other incidents occurred at the Taman Ismail Marzuki (TIM) cultural center. First police sided with about 15 artists who objected to a discussion on the 1965 communist purge during the Jakarta Theater Festival. The artists merely expressed their opinion, but police deployed more than 200 officers to prevent the discussion. Dozens of other artists condemned the police. Later that month, police also stood idly by while FPI members harassed passing motorists as they searched for Purwakarta Regent Dedi Mulyadi to prevent him from entering Jakarta. Dedi, known for his policy of ensuring freedom of worship even for the much-resented Shiite minority, was invited to speak at TIM. The police even took Dedi into custody 'Äúfor his own safety'Äù.

I went to an elementary school built from woven bamboo 'Äî you have probably would have seen that if you came to Java in the 1960s. After school, I would help mother with her home business and father with his bookstore business. But still every month, I always wondered if my and siblings'Äô school tuition would be paid. And that was not that bad, the family had each other. Friends and some relatives disappeared and lost their loved ones during the communist purge. How can I forget that? And so I do appreciate, follow, and respect most rights activists who speak up and rally for the cause of others. Want2makecents Exactly, as described by the famous Maslow'Äôs Hierarchy of Needs.

"Sat, March 19, 2016","Editorial: Welcome, new city police chief","Jakarta will on Monday welcome new Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Moechgiyarto, who replaces Insp. Gen. Tito Karnavian who was sworn in as head of the new National Counterterrorism Agency (BNPT) this week. As chief of the West Java Police, Moechgiyarto said that he would protect minority groups, in particular Ahmadis and Shiites. He backed up those words at least once, having police officers in Bandung form a human line to allow Shiites to celebrate Assyura last year. Officers in Bogor, however, did roughly the opposite, though Bogor Mayor Bima Arya played a significant role there; he himself went to the event to personally disperse the Assyura as they celebrated. Another cause for skepticism is Moechgiyarto'Äôs defense of virginity testing on female police cadets when he was the head of the law division of the National Police. This has left some unsure how his tenure will unfold. After all, there was much hope for Tito when he took office as chief, but that was dashed within five months. Tito, who earned his master'Äôs degree on Police Studies from Exeter University in the UK was installed as the chief in June last year. He had a clean track record, was well respected for his work with the antiterrorism squad Densus 88 and was known as one of the best among his peers. But, less than a year into his tenure as chief in Jakarta, six incidents had taken place where the forces under his command failed to maintain impartiality. The first incident was in November when the Jakarta Police intimidated the Association of Journalists for Diversity (Sejuk) into canceling their event on terrorism, only because the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) was offended by the event'Äôs poster, or more correctly, a draft of the poster that circulated in limited circles, which depicted FPI members carrying Islamic State (IS) movement flags. The police also asked the organizers to apologize to the FPI. Other incidents involved encroaching on the rights of leftists, free thinkers and transgender people. The latest was just this week, when the police told German cultural center the Goethe Institute that they could not guarantee their safety should they screen a documentary on political prisoners affiliated with Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), Pulau Buru Tanah Air Beta (Buru island, my homeland). But let'Äôs not dwell on pessimistic thoughts. We have that Bandung event to spur some optimism about Moechgiyarto. So welcome, and we hope you uphold impartiality not only for Greater Jakarta'Äôs Shiites and Ahmadis, but also the city'Äôs leftists, its transgender community and its free thinkers, and anyone who unwittingly offends moralist vigilante groups. Jakartans naturally expect the capital'Äôs police to be role models for police across the nation, in terms of strengthening their commitment to protect and serve all citizens.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/03/19/editorial-welcome-new-city-police-chief.html,,2016
"Thu, March 24, 2016",Text your say: Unique Indonesian democracy,"Your comments on the views of Jeremy Menchik, a professor fromBoston University'Äôs Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies, whosaid in his 224-page book Islam and Democracy in Indonesia: Tolerancewithout Liberalism that democratic values such as freedom and equalitywere more common in secular states. Common people also think that Wikipedia is reliable and that Chelsea is a good soccer team, but that doesn'Äôt make it true. Also the downfall of the economy and harassment of LGBT is only an issue if you are personally affected. A lonely farmer on the hillsides of Sumatra has his fields and his food, and if somebody in the big city wants to dress up in rainbow colors and kiss on a public street, he couldn'Äôt care less, unless somebody makes him believe it is important. It is here that religion comes in, or politics or the latest sinetron for that matter. So if God is divine in heaven, and you don'Äôt have anything better to do, you would be on the barricades to support him for whatever he wants to do. OB Most Muslims simply believe, never challenging their indoctrination from birth. Why are Muslims opposed to the upcoming parliamentary election in Jordan? Because they believe that democracy is in contradiction with Islam'Äôs concept of the sovereignty of Allah'Äôs law. They argue that Islam and democracy cannot go together, and they are obviously right. Goblues Eight years to come up with this tosh. Jeremy, you have been wasting your time. 'ÄúWe need to decouple the idea of tolerance and liberalism in Indonesian democracy.'Äù In truth, Indonesian society is neither liberal nor tolerant. It is highly authoritarian and autocratic. You see it on the roads. Bikes keep out of the way of cars and cars keep out of the way of lories and buses. It is a power-obsessed society in which the powerful, run political parties of squirming sycophancy. It is a country where alleged criminals are completely above tax, environmental and criminal law. They just bulldoze people out of the way. There is no respect for human rights in this country, so there is neither liberalism nor tolerance in a political sense. What we have is a culture of total impunity for the powerful, which is just another way of saying that the country is conservative, authoritarian and coercive. JL Indonesia'Äôs attitude to religion is colored by the people'Äôs rampant nationalism, and it'Äôs an unequal relationship between the two. This comes as no surprise when you note that the entire ruling class (indeed the whole of adult society, without exception) lived their formative years under Soeharto. Islam under Soeharto was shaped to fit his Indonesia. The situation exists in which, if religious demands conflict with the national interest, the national interest wins. You can see this most clearly in the article of faith known as Pancasila, stamped permanently onto the minds of the very young (every Indonesian child learns it by rote, and repeats it daily in a similar fashion to the American pledge of allegiance) and which most Indonesians would defend passionately if challenged. When Pancasila says that everyone is allowed to adhere to their own faith (so long as it'Äôs a monotheistic one 'Äî the cognitive dissonance of this is hilarious, by the way, when discussing Hindus 'Äî Indonesians assuring you that Hindus are actually monotheists in Indonesia) this over-rides the Islamic calls for war against non-believers. It shouldn'Äôt be any surprise when the people also support (and the ruling class push toward) democracy of a sort, despite the religious injunctions against it. We grant that people to behave a certain way because of their religious faith. By the same token, nationalism can and does inform action. The 'Äúrespect for democracy'Äù of the Indonesian people is a product of the Constitution. Jakart Your analysis seems a bit dated to me. While true about the Soeharto years, the Islamists are infinitely bolder and more aggressive now. Soeharto wouldn'Äôt have tolerated the FPI closing churches. Gays were free to party in Tanumur back in the day, and there was no FPI baying for their blood. The country is drifting towards Shariaization, one narrow-minded bylaw at a time. It will not end well. JIH When I first came to Indonesia in 2005, you could buy wine in the supermarket in Palembang, Bandung and Jakarta. By 2008 you could buy it in none of those places. Now you can'Äôt even buy beer in a mini-mart. There is now sharia in Aceh. There are more people wearing headscarves every year. There are more salaam alaikums and fewer selamat pagis with every passing year. There are more Alhamdulillahs with every passing year. There are less animist practices in the villages of Java and shamanism of many kinds is being repressed. The process happens slowly, slowly but every year it tips more toward acceptance of hard Islamist dogma. Jaim Is Islam compatible with democracy? Islamic law is absolutely incompatible with true democracy. It is a theocratic system with Allah alone at its head. Allah'Äôs law is interpreted by a ruling body of clerics. There is no room for a secular political system in which all people are treated as equals. Hadith and Sira 'Äî 'ÄúWhen you meet your enemies who are polytheists [Christians...], invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withhold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to accept Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them [...] If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah'Äôs help and fight them.'Äù Non-Muslims are intended to be subordinate to Muslims.

"Sun, April 3 2016",FPI denies attack on Shia book forum,"The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) has denied allegations that it attacked and dispersed by force a book discussion forum led by a Shiite author held on Friday evening in Pekanbaru, Riau. An angry mob dispersed the discussion of a book by Ali Sariati. The book talks about Fatimah, a daughter of Prophet Muhammad. The speaker, Muslim scholar AM Safwan, who is also a Shiite, agreed to discontinue the discussion held by the Islam Philosophy Activists Network (Jaksi) and the Pekanbaru Batas Arus discussion club at the office of the Muslim University Students Association (HMI). M. Jumaiza Saputra, an executive of the Islam Defenders Militia (LPI), one of the FPI’s subordinates, said the FPI was invited by an executive of the HMI to protect the speaker. “We did not want him to be attacked, so we saved him from irresponsible individuals who hate Shia blindly,” Jumaiza said, adding that the incident at the forum was incited by other groups who came to the event on their own initiative. Jumaiza said FPI members had taken Safwan to FPI Riau’s headquarters, allowing him to spend the night there. “This morning we took him to the airport so he could catch the first flight home to Yogyakarta,” he told The Jakarta Post on Saturday. He added that the FPI had decided to protect Safwan because he was not from a sect within Shia that was considered deviant. “The problem is that not all people in Pekanbaru understand the sects in Shia. They think all Shiite are deviant,” Jumaiza said. Separately, Munawir Materang, the chairman of HMI’s Riau Islands branch, said the discussion at the HMI office was held without his consent. He said the co-initiator of the discussion was a HMI member who had distributed information about the event on his Facebook page. The co-initiator, however, did not realize that the event had something to do with Shia Islam. “I am glad the event was canceled. Otherwise, the building could have been damaged by the mob. The event had nothing to do with the HMI,” he said. Meanwhile, Safwan arrived safely in Yogyakarta on Saturday morning, confirming that he was protected from the angry mob by leaders from the FPI. “In a dialogue with leaders from FPI Pekanbaru, the angry mob did not question my faith. They told me that the situation in Pekanbaru was not harmonious, as particular groups of society had been involved in anti-Shia campaigns,” he said. Safwan, who is also a mentor at Yogyakarta’s Muthahhari Islamic boarding school for university students, said that during the dialogue with FPI, he explained that he was not a member of a Shia sect that insulted the wives and friends of the Prophet Muhammad. “They understood and accepted my explanation,” he said, adding that Shia teachings had a number of categories and should not be generalized. The FPI is notorious for orchestrating the cancelation of various events. Recently, the police bowed to the FPI by shutting down a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) group’s closed workshop in Jakarta. The FPI blocked in December a discussion and the reading of a drama script about the 1965 communist purge, arguing that the event “harmed nationalism”.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/04/03/fpi-denies-attack-shia-book-forum.html,,2016

He said that during the rally, Rizieq had referred to the party’s chairman as “Wiranti”, because of the latter’s support for Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama in next year’s gubernatorial election. In the Indonesian naming system, a name ending in “i” normally denotes a woman while a name ending in “o” usually refers to a man. “It is not appropriate for a person calling himself a cleric to make such a statement,” Didi said. On Tuesday, the FPI along with several other organizations, staged a rally in front of the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) headquarters in South Jakarta demanding the anti-graft body prosecute Ahok for what they claimed was corruption surrounding the land procurement for Sumber Waras Hospital. The FPI previously reported Ahok to the KPK for his alleged role in the case.

"Sat, April 16 2016",Jokowi inaugurates new Lemhannas governor,"It is common for people to have high expectations when a new head is named for a strategic institution, like the government-sanctioned military think tank the National Resilience Institute (Lemhannas). President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo had the same expectations on Friday when he inaugurated Lt. Gen. (ret) Agus Widjojo as the new Lemhannas governor. The President expects that the institute under Agus will play a greater role in helping the government implement its policies. “The President instructed me to make Lemhannas more apparent in people’s daily activities across the country, and also able to handle urgent matters in order to assist the government in implementing its policies,” Agus, a former Indonesian Military (TNI) chief of territorial affairs, said after his inauguration. Agus, who was in the military academy’s class of 1970 and has a master’s degree in public administration, added that he would continue existing programs set out by his predecessor Budi Susilo Soepandji. According to Agus, who is the leader of a team that next week will host a reconciliation symposium on the 1965 communist purge, the team will take steps to anticipate potential disturbances at the event following a recent move by the police to disperse a gathering of 1965 victims in Cipanas, West Java. The police forced the cancelation of the event — which was aimed at discussing victims’ preparations for the symposium — reportedly following pressure from the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). The symposium aims to discuss psychological, social and political triggers of the 1965 atrocities, despite skepticism expressed by rights campaigners recently. Activists believe the symposium will serve as a means for the government to claim that all relevant stakeholders have been duly consulted, while legal methods remain unused. “We anticipate [disturbances] as [the symposium] is the first [such open forum],” said Agus, the son of Gen. Sutoyo Siswomiharjo, one of the Army generals who was killed in the events of 1965. A number of related events, including discussions and movie screenings, have been banned or called off due to pressure from hard-line organizations. The police recently stopped the Turn Left Festival in Jakarta, which was aimed at accommodating history enthusiasts who wanted to share their thoughts about leftism in Indonesia. In December, the police also canceled a discussion and script reading about the 1965 communist purge after the FPI blocked the events, saying they “harmed nationalism”. Last October, citing pressure from the police, organizers of the Ubud Writers and Readers Festival (UWRF) canceled all sessions related to the communist purge, including a book launch, art exhibition and a screening of Joshua Oppenheimer’s film The Look of Silence. Human rights campaigners have demanded Jokowi formally request that the US government unlock archives related to the 1965 communist purge, following a request sent to US President Barack Obama by the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) last month. The US has previously opened access to data on the so-called Dirty War in Brazil and Argentina. Although there has yet to be a formal decision, Attorney General Prasetyo has repeatedly said the government might opt out of judicial processes and focus on reconciliation to settle a number of past rights abuse cases, including the 1965 purge. ---------------- To receive comprehensive and earlier access to The Jakarta Post printedition, please subscribe to our epaper through iOS' iTunes, Android's GooglePlay, Blackberry World or Microsoft's Windows Store.

"Mon, April 18 2016",High hopes set for 1st govt-sponsored dialogue on 1965,"Despite reluctance to address the 1965 tragedy that is thought to have claimed thousands of lives, the government is set to safeguard the first state-sponsored symposium on the controversial subject. The event will include the thorough examination of the mass killing of Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) members and sympathizers that followed the ousting of first president Sukarno. The symposium, that starts on Monday, will bring victims, government officials and academics together to look through the country’s dark history from various angles in an effort to find comprehensive solutions to the prolonged, unresolved cases of gross human-rights violations that occurred between late 1965 and early 1966. The leader of the symposium, Let. Gen. (ret) Agus Widjojo, who was recently inaugurated as National Resilience Institute (Lemhanas) governor, is confident that the event will run safely according to plan despite protests from hard-line groups opposed to the initiative. “We already have the police in charge of security since we know that this is a sensitive issue. We have also collaborated with the office of the coordinating political, legal and security affairs minister, which will certainly help. I’m upbeat that it will run safely,” Agus told The Jakarta Post over the weekend. Similar confidence was also shown by National Police chief Gen. Badrodin Haiti, who was optimistic that his personnel would successfully secure the two-day event. “We are prepared [...] the Jakarta Police will be in charge.” The decision to set up the symposium resulted from months of meetings by a government reconciliation team set up to search for the best pathway, which officials have dubbed “the Indonesian way”, for dealing with the 1965 massacre, as well as other cases of gross rights abuses. Led by Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Luhut Pandjaitan, the reconciliation team involves the Law and Human Rights Ministry, the Attorney General’s Office and the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM). Under the supervision of the Presidential Advisory Board (Wantimpres), the team has been organizing meetings and discussions with various stakeholders, from human-rights campaigners and academics to individuals who have suffered themselves. Although it is the first gathering officially sponsored by the government, it is not the first attempt to publicly discuss the matter. Various groups have initiated gatherings aimed at recalling and reviewing the 1965 incident, but many of them were forcibly cancelled due to pressure from radical groups that use the Pancasila to defend their actions. One such incident was the recent forced dissolution of a meeting for survivors of the mass murder, mostly people over 60 years old, organized by the 1965 Murder Victims’ Research Foundation (YPKP 65) in Cipanas, West Java. Pressure from hundreds of Islam Defenders Front (FPI) members and the youth organization Pemuda Pancasila forced the event to stop. Prior to that, the FPI and like-minded groups had insisted on shutting down many meetings and art performances seen as encouraging the rise of communism. On Saturday, anti-PKI hard-liner, Front Pancasila, threatened to deploy followers to Hotel Aryaduta, the symposium venue, in an attempt to stop it from happening over a suspicion that it aims to lawfully reinstate the PKI. The organization spokesperson Alfian Tanjung claimed that 90 percent of the gathering’s 200 invitees were affiliated with the once largest political party in the country. No matter what, Lemhanas governor Agus, whose father, Gen. Sutoyo Siswomiharjo was killed during the initial Sept. 30 attack in 1965, rebutted such suggestions. “How can they move past that opinion if they refuse to discuss it together? It’s time for us to leave stereotyping behind.” The scheduled symposium has immediately attracted enthusiasm from survivors and rights campaigners who are looking forward to the results of the event. Activist Bedjo Untung, himself a victim, said that 17 survivors from the 1965 Murder Victims’ Research Foundation would attend the discussion. “We are happy as this is the first national discussion where we have the chance to speak for ourselves”. The event is expected to result in recommendations being made to President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo who is scheduled to make an official announcement next month regarding the government’s stance on the reconciliation process. ______________________________________________ To receive comprehensive andearlier access to The Jakarta Post print edition, please subscribe to ourepaper through iOS' iTunes, Android's Google Play, Blackberry World orMicrosoft's Windows Store.

As a girl who was born and raised in the heyday of Soeharto’s iron-fist rule, I clearly knew who the bogeyman was then. The bloody coup supposedly orchestrated by the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) in 1965, thwarted ingeniously just in time by then Lt. Gen. Soeharto and loyal troops, was drummed up into historical books, an annually-run TV movie and various other propaganda mediums. Not until I left the country as an adult and was exposed to the world more that I came to understand the oversimplification of ideologies and history that Soeharto’s New Order had consciously imposed, and how similar to 1950’s America my growing up under his rule had been. Then 1998 Reformasi (political reform) came and I thought, whoa, the distribution of information would be free now, the masses would no longer be structurally duped. I felt like it was the dawn of the Age of Aquarius for all Indonesians. Yet what happened? Just a decade into what was supposedly the enlightenment in democratic governance, we were handed another bogeyman. Kaum kafir. The infidels. The heathens. The non-believers — either not believing in the almighty, or merely not believing in the same divinity we do. Islamic hard-liners have had a great run for several years now. For a long time most people, including levelheaded Muslims, were too afraid to contradict the garden variety of hate speeches spewed about daily and twice on Fridays. Yet lately, the public seems to have gotten a teeny bit wiser— many Muslims have openly called out the likes of FPI as common thugs dressed in Middle Eastern garbs, and the vocal Islam-based political parties received paltry votes in the 2014 election. This means it’s probably time for a new bogeyman. Yet what surprised me the most is that, instead of creating a new one, the powers that be decided to dust off the shelves and brought out, again, the good old PKI and its leftist ilk. In 2016. It doesn’t matter that our own founding father’s legendary concept of “Marhaenism”, the little people, is rooted in Marxism. Doesn’t matter the country’s prized philosophical ideology Pancasila, in its mission to support the little people, owes at least its 2nd and 5th principles to socialism. It doesn’t matter the current ruling party never shied away from touting leftist ideals, such as a welfare state, during their opposition years. Neither does it matter that since the fall of the Soviet Union a couple of decades ago communism is generally considered a failed ideology. Late president Hugo Chavez’s political and economic experiments have left Venezuela virtually bankrupt, China is the world’s largest customer for luxury goods and Cuba is unapologetically the largest growing market for the capitalistic Airbnb. How do you fear something that, while it has lent wisdom to your country’s own fundamentals, is an extreme spectrum ideology that no longer holds power over the world? What is even sadder is that, it may just still work. Thanks to inadequate teaching of the social sciences in our education system, many Indonesians still lump communism, socialism and atheism into one box while throwing consumerism, hedonism, liberalism and capitalism into another. If you think that’s horribly misguided, wait until you hear that once an angry mob set Das Kapital on fire because the book taught capitalism. I’m never one to attach myself to any ideology for I believe nobody can be that black-and-white consistently throughout life, and I’m not here to defend communism, since frankly there’s nothing left to defend. But I’m never a fan of dumbing down another generation on basic social science while other nations are racing to cure cancer, create renewable energy or reach Jupiter. This phobia resurrection against the supposed resurrection of communism, while amusing at times, is troubling in principle. Troubling that one can get hell-bent in defending or attacking what one doesn’t fundamentally understand for one never being properly taught on; even more troubling is that there are people adamant in sustaining indefinitely such a fearful bogeyman. I don’t know who they are, and I’m dumbfounded as to why the country’s highest office hasn’t stopped the National Police for curtailing public discourses on political science or arresting people over silly t-shirts. Does it count as a Mental Revolution when we let a bogeyman loose among our men, women and children, Mr. President? While I’ll pretend Mr. President reads this column and hence is now pondering my question, you can go underground to see that, now that anything that can be labeled “leftist” is verboten, the price tags of such illicit materials will only soar. And you won’t need a communist to tell you that, a capitalist will do just fine. So yeah, have fun with the “kafir” and “komunis” bogeyman. I’d rather go and have my nails done.

"Thu, May 19 2016",University ends Marx talks after FPI threat,"On the fray: Students of the Bandung-based Indonesian Art and Culture Institute (ISBI) stage a rally on Wednesday against the forced termination of a Marx school program as a result of intimidation by the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). The FPI claimed that the class was a means to spread communism.(JP/Arya Dipa) A student press group in Bandung, West Java, has refused to bow to pressure from an intimidating hard-line group that had dispersed the former’s Sekolah Marx (School of Marx), an event for discussions on Marxism, on May 10. On that day, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) through intimidation demanded the student press group, Daunjati of the Indonesian Art and Culture Institute (ISBI), end the event. But on Wednesday the press group concluded School of Marx on its own terms, with a closing ceremony called Panggung Seni untuk Demokrasi (Art Stage for Democracy). Daunjati chairman Mohamad Chandra Irfan in his speech during the ceremony said that the decision to hold an art stage was far from its initial plans to conclude the event with a class entitled “The Creation of Theatre Based on Karl Marx’s thought”. “We argued with the university on how to conclude the event. But in the end they gave the go-ahead for us to end the event with the art stage,” Chandra said Wednesday. He said that in organizing the art stage, the press group had been in cooperation with several university student councils, including from the Bandung Institute of Technology, Langlangbuana University, Bandung Raya University and the Indonesia-America Computer Education Center. “The change of plans did not mean we finally bowed down to the FPI’s pressure, but serves as a sign of consolidation among university students in Bandung,” Chandra said. School of Marx began in February, holding a series of discussions on Marxism, such as the Visual Aesthetics Based on Karl Marx’s Thoughts and Stage Art Paradigm According to Karl Marx. Chandra accused the campus for “bowing to pressure from the FPI by cancelling the last class”. “We try to strengthen the democratic environment of this campus, which has to be free from pressure and intimidation from outsiders, let alone hard-line groups,” he added. ISBI vice rector for academic and student affairs, Benny Yohanes, denied Chandra’s claim, saying that the university did not back away from supporting the School of Marx event. “We will add this kind of class to the campus’ syllabus, because it could spark creativity among the students,” he said. Research, Technology and Higher Education Ministry spokesperson Munawir Razak said that the ministry had not been in contact with the ISBI regarding the FPI’s intimidation or anything related to the event. The ministry’s director-general for learning and student affairs, Intan Achmad, could not be reached for comment by The Jakarta Post as of Wednesday night. This was the third act of intimidation toward an art or academic event in Bandung since the start of the year. In the past 12 months there were at least 15 similar discussions and cultural events opposed by hard-liners. On March 23, the FPI dispersed a monologue performance about the national hero, Tan Malaka, entitled Saya Rusa Berbulu Merah (I Am A Red-furred Fox), demanding the organizer cancel the performance over fears the show advocated communism. The monologue was presented a day after and secured by 200 Bandung Police personnel. On May 9, a group named the West Java Islamic Alliance staged a rally in front of the Sunan Gunung Djati State Islamic University, demanding the campus halt a discussion because it invited Shiite intellectual Jalaludin Rakhmat and Liberal Islam Network (JIL) activist Ulil Absar Abdala as speakers.

"Fri, May 20 2016",Bandung gripped with communist fears,"In absence of the State’s assurance for freedom of expression, the nation has continuously witnessed repressive acts against academic freedom within university campuses across the country. While it was the police who halted a number of such academic events in Yogyakarta, lately, similar repression was observed in West Java. The only difference in the latter was that the hard-line group, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), played the role of oppressor. Just on Thursday, the social and political sciences department of Padjajaran University (Unpad) in Sumedang, near West Java’s capital of Bandung, decided to cancel its seminar, entitled “Marxisme sebagai Ilmu Pengetahuan” (Marxism as science) following intimidation by the FPI. Activist Firman Ekoputra from the Rumah Kiri organization, Unpad political scholar M. Rolip Saptamaji and Unpad political science lecturer Carolina Paskarina were initially scheduled to speak at the seminar. It was the second repressive act in only a week by the FPI against freedom of academic expression in the province. On May 10, the hard-liners dispersed Sekolah Marx (School of Marx), an event discussing Marxism conducted by the Daunjati student press group of the Indonesian Art and Culture Institute (ISBI). The FPI demanded Daunjati end the event, but the press group continued with proceedings until last Wednesday, albeit with compromises. Student Council spokesperson of Unpad’s social and political sciences department Muhammad Ariq Andarmesa said the FPI had come to the university, demanding that the university cancel the seminar. “The academic affairs division of my department then asked the students to cancel the event, citing security reasons,” Ariq told The Jakarta Post in an interview on Thursday. He also received various anonymous phone calls, including one claimed to be from police intelligence, telling Ariq to beware as tension with communists was simmering. “This proves the campus, once heralded as an autonomous institution free from outside pressures, is powerless in dealing with threats to its academic freedom,” Ariq said. The department head, Widya Setiabudi, said recommending the student council delay the seminar was aimed to “deal with the simmering tension”. “We wanted to cool down the situation. In the end, we just postponed the event,” Widya said, adding that Marxism was a common subject of campus discussion, given that it was part of the social and political studies course. However, Research, Technology and Higher Education Minister Muhammad Nasir told the Post on Thursday that Marxism was banned in all campuses in the country. “It cannot be taught as a university subject. Every campus has to abide by the law,” Nasir said, adding that Marxism was not in line with core values that embody the “belief in God” principle, outlined in the Constitution. The ministry’s director-general for academic and student affairs, Intan Achmad, said he was unaware that Marxism had become a subject at the university. Meanwhile, National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Boy Rafli Amar said it was the police’s job to handle communist-related events, not the FPI’s. “The FPI should not act as vigilantes toward any event related to communism,” Boy told the Post on Thursday. Separately, Institute for Policy Research and Advocacy (ELSAM) researcher Andi Mutaqqien said Article 219 of the Criminal Code, which stipulates that advocating communism is a crime, was open to interpretation. “Not every seminar on communism intends to advocate the ideology,” Andi said.

"Mon, May 23 2016","Scholars, govt differ on Marxism","Amid intimidation from the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) against scholarly discussions on Marxism, the country’s intellectuals and the government are still arguing about whether the leftist ideology is an acceptable subject for discussion. If the country’s scholars and the government are unable to settle their differences, the FPI’s hostility could become the ultimate winner in this lengthy debate over freedom of expression. Several academics on Sunday called on the government to protect freedom of expression at universities following a series of crackdowns on discussions on Marxism in Bandung and Sumedang, West Java, by the FPI. The FPI dispersed a discussion at the Indonesia Institute of Arts and Science (ISBI) in Bandung on May 10 and a seminar on the same topic at the Padjajaran University (Unpad) in Sumedang on May 19. Despite the crackdown and coercion, the Research, Technology and Higher Education Ministry has washed its hands of the matter, proclaiming Marxism illegal in all universities in the world’s fourth largest democracy. “Marxism cannot be taught because it is not in line with the nation’s ideology of Pancasila,” Intan Achmad, the ministry’s director-general for learning and student affairs, told The Jakarta Post. Responding to that statement, Mukhtasar Syamsuddin, head of Gadjah Mada University’s (UGM) School of Philosophy, said the government should ensure protection for any kind of event on campus, including events at respectable education centers in West Java. “These discussions are within the academic realm. They are not efforts intended to change the nation’s ideology. The government has to provide protection as part of its mandate to educate the whole nation,” Mukhtasar told the Post on Sunday. He said Marxism had been taught at his school since the 2000s, a move aimed at giving his students a complete philosophical perspective. “We are obliged to learn every branch of philosophy, including Marxism, liberalism, pluralism and multiculturalism, because they cannot be critical toward everything without having a holistic comprehension,” he said. In stark contrast to Mukhtasar’s sentiment, Intan said “there is no need to wax nostalgic on the uses of Marxism, for it does not have place anymore in this era”. Nonetheless, renowned scholar Franz Magnis Suseno said Marxism was still a “relevant” subject for discussion, especially in the academic forum, so that younger generations would know why the teaching could not be implemented in the country that uses Pancasila as its governing ideology. “The law only prohibits the dissemination of Marxism-Leninism, based on the now-defunct Indonesian Communist Party, with the intention of changing the country’s founding ideology,” Franz told the Post on Sunday, referring to Article 219 of the Criminal Code. “Marxism is not an ideology. There is a lot of it that is not related to communism, such as Marx’s critical theory of society,” said Franz, a senior lecturer at the Driyarkara School of Philosophy in Jakarta. Franz also raised his concerns over the government’s “inaction” in dealing with the swelling tide of intimidation and intolerance seen in West Java, saying “it is a dangerous threat to freedom of academic expression. This threat is more dangerous than the threat posed by the FPI”. Meanwhile, several academics within the Progressive Intellectuals Forum, including UGM sociologist Arie Sujito, Sanata Dharma University historian Baskara T. Wardaya and Airlangga University political science lecturer Airlangga Pribadi, demanded on Saturday that the government protect freedom of academic expression on campus. Separately, the crackdown on communist symbolism continues as soldiers from the Batanghari base in Jambi apprehended a man, identified as RS, on Saturday for wearing shirt with the hammer-and-sickle logo, similar to that of the PKI.

"Sat, June 18 2016",FPI forces interfaith event to move from church hall,"Triggered by objections from the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) in Central Java over former first lady Sinta Nuriyah Wahid’s plan to participate in an interfaith community event at a church on Thursday, in which attendees were to share a symbolic meal to end the daily fast, the event was forced to move to a neutral venue — a subdistrict meeting hall. The program was initially to be held at Kristus Raja Church in Ungaran, Semarang regency, Central Java, but due to objections voiced by FPI, a well-known hardliner Islamic group, it moved to Santo Yakobus Zebedeus Church, Pudak Payung, Semarang. The FPI continued to object to the event after it was relocated to the Santo Yakobus Zebedeus Church, so organizers once again moved the fast-breaking program to the Pudak Payung subdistrict hall, located 100 meters from Santo Yakobus. The decision to move the event to the subdistrict hall was made during a coordination meeting held at the Semarang Police headquarters, involving the organizing committee, both church managements, FPI and the police. Despite initial objections and the series of venue changes, the event went ahead peacefully and the hall was not disturbed. Members of Barisan Serbaguna (Banser), Nahdlatul Ulama’s (NU) Central Java branch, were seen calmly ensuring Sinta’s safety. Members of the Presidential security detail (Paspampres) were also seen securing the traffic between Santo Yakobus Church and the Pudak Payung subdistrict hall. Chairman of FPI Central Java’s advocacy and legal team, Zaenal Abidin Petir, said FPI had never banned Sinta from visiting Central Java, and had not attempted to prevent her from attending a fast-breaking meal at the church. “What we objected to was that lay Muslims were also invited to the fast-breaking,” said Zaenal, alleging that the faith of economically poor and lay Muslims could be destabilized in the face of humanist church circles. “That’s why we did not want the fast-breaking to be held at the church,” Zaenal said. The organizing committee said the fast-breaking event had been prepared long before, involving respected Muslim figures and local mosque management. The organizing committee invited 425 locals, community leaders and government officers. Accompanying Sinta was Semarang Mayor Hendrar Prihadi, the chairman of the Semarang diocese interfaith and faith relation commission Aloysius Budi Purnomo, and a number of other religious figures. Responding to the FPI’s objections, Aloysius Budi Purnomo said that the fast-breaking event involving an interfaith community had been organized at the wish of Sinta, who has been conducting such events for the last 16 years. Before the event was moved to the subdistrict hall, Sinta had the chance to speak for 15 minutes before the Christian community at the Santo Yakobus Zebedeus Church. Budi assured that no incident, violence or act of coercion had been carried out in order to have the location of the fast-breaking event moved. He said the decision to move the event to the subdistrict hall was the result of a compromise involving all parties.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/06/18/fpi-forces-interfaith-event-move-church-hall.html,,2016
"Wed, June 22 2016",Religious Affairs Ministry: White elephant or political necessity?,"All religions, including Islam, teach us to be honest. So I was chagrinned when I read in the papers that Suryadharma Ali, former religious affairs minister (October 2009-May 2014) had committed corruption. He was found guilty of multiple charges of graft during his time in office. He embezzled haj funds between 2010 and 2013 and misused the ministry’s operational funds between 2011 and 2014 for personal gain. The religious affairs minister, engaged in corruption? Oh boy, not only does that go against religious values but also against the law. Double disgrace! I was pleased to read that his prison term was increased from six to 10 years. And there’s also the afterlife punishment for him to look forward to. It’s not the first time a minister of religious affairs was indicted for corruption. In 2006, Said Agil Husin Al Munawar, religious affairs minister (2001-2004) under president Megawati Soekarnoputri, was sentenced to five years in jail for corruption. He embezzled Rp 35.7 billion (US$2.67 million) of haj funds as well as more than Rp 240 billion of the Ummah Endowment Fund (Dana Abadi Umat) in 2002-2004. Hmmm, not exactly small change, huh? Well, at least these two ministers are consistent with the reputation of the religious affairs ministry as being one of the most corrupt state institutions. At least in that way they don’t disappoint! Given this state of affairs, why doesn’t the government abolish the ministry? The late Abdurrahman “Gus Dur” Wahid, Indonesia’s fourth president, whose brief presidency (1999-2001) was a shambles and ended in his impeachment, did put out the idea. One month into his presidency he had closed down two ministries: the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Information. But when he mentioned his intention to abolish the Ministry of Religious Affairs, it caused an uproar among traditional Muslims. Indeed it would have been highly ironic, since the ministry is a bastion of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the largest Muslim organization in Indonesia, founded by Gus Dur’s grandfather and of which he himself was the head. Historically, the establishment of the Religious Affairs Ministry was a kind of consolation prize for proponents of political Islam in Indonesia. They were disappointed when Sukarno-Hatta, Indonesia’s founding fathers, refused to insert the words “with the obligation to practice sharia” after “Belief in One God”, the first principle of the state ideology Pancasila. The inclusion of these words would have effectively made Indonesia an Islamic state, something our founding fathers did not think was a good idea considering Indonesia’s pluralistic society. The proposal to establish a ministry of religious affairs was actually struck down twice before it was finally agreed upon. And so, on Jan. 3, 1946, Indonesia’s Ministry of Religious Affairs was born. It’s a bit of a misnomer. Actually it should be called the Ministry of Islam, as it deals mainly with issues relating to Islam. Even their logo only has an Islamic symbol, the rehal , an X-shaped foldable wooden book stand on which to rest the Quran. No sign of the symbols of the other state-recognized religions: Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism, let alone widespread traditional beliefs in Indonesia. Hello? The reasons for Gus Dur to suggest in 1999 to abolish this ministry are the same that prompt many others to do so now. Besides the disgraceful rampant corruption, there’s bureaucratic inefficiency and the ministry’s failure to contribute anything to interfaith peace and to prevent acts of violence against religious minorities. Why, Suryadharma Ali himself said Ahmadiyah should be banned as heretical when in fact its followers have been part of Indonesia since 1925, 20 years before the country gained independence. Indonesia constantly falls into the category of countries with appalling religious freedoms. Several international as well as local watchdogs have cited consistent attacks, intimidation and acts of violence, including killings, against religious minorities. The US Commission on International Religious Freedom, for example, stated that Indonesia’s tradition of pluralism had been strained in recent years by “ongoing sectarian tensions, societal violence and the arrest of individuals considered religiously deviant”. Attempts to abolish the Religious Affairs Ministry or at least to redefine its function occurred even at the beginning of Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s presidency. When rumors circulated that the ministry might be abolished, a smear campaign was waged against Jokowi, accusing him of being anti-Islam, of being Chinese (?) and even linking him with certain Christian capitalists and missionaries. Risibly absurd, but at the same time deadly serious. One of the success indicators of the Religious Affairs Ministry is the haj pilgrimage. At the same time, it’s also its biggest source of corruption. Surely the solution could be quite simple: to set up a separate, professional body dealing with the technical, logistical and administrative haj matters — something that even a travel agency could do. In fact last April, Commission VIII of the House of Representatives approved a bill on the implementation of the haj and the umrah, which separates the regulator and the implementer. That’s a good way to cut the corruption in the Ministry! The other potential source of corruption is Islamic education: building schools, procuring books, etc. You may recall the notorious case of Golkar Party lawmaker Zulkarnaen Djabar, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2013 for corruption involving the procurement of Qurans. Again, Islamic education could be overseen by the Ministry of Education. So everything points to the dissolution of the Religious Affairs Ministry, right? Wrong. The historical and political considerations make it well nigh impossible. Especially when one considers that currently the conservative Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) and the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and Hizbuth Thahrir Indonesia (HTI) are slowly overshadowing moderate organizations, such as NU. NU becomes increasingly important when you consider a project they launched at their muktamar (national conference) in August last year, to promote Islam Nusantara (Islam of the Archipelago) as a counter to the rigid and violent ideology of Islamic State (IS) movement, and locally, FPI and HTI. So, maybe the Religious Affairs Ministry is not a white elephant after all. It’s a political and security necessity. __________________________ The writer is the author of Julia’s Jihad.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/06/22/religious-affairs-ministry-white-elephant-or-political-necessity.html,,2016
"Tue, August 30 2016",Why AILA is a bigger threat to freedom than the FPI,"The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) — imagine its members roaming the streets of Jakarta, hunting down Playboy magazines and vandalizing cheap liquor stores — may no longer epitomize religious conservatism in Indonesia. Its position has now been taken over by a group of preachers and academics with the exact same agenda but with a much less threatening moniker and, alas, a much bigger chance to achieve what the FPI militants can only dream of. The Family Love Alliance (AILA), which aspires to make the country more “civilized” by “strengthening family values”, is now at the forefront of the conservative movement in the country. Unlike the FPI, which often acts outside or above the law, AILA is exploiting the existing legal system to turn law enforcers into a morality police, so that later they will practically do what the FPI has been doing for years. The group has requested that the Constitutional Court change the definitions of adultery, rape and sodomy in the Criminal Code. The purpose of this judicial review petition is clear: to outlaw any consensual sexual relationship outside of marriage, including same-sex relationships. AILA, which also means “big family” in Arabic, has gained support from academics from prestigious universities, such as the University of Indonesia, the Bogor Agricultural Institute (IPB) and Padjajaran University. Hamid Chalid, a constitutional law professor from UI, for example, testified in the latest hearing at the court, where he argued that the Criminal Code in its current form was “too liberal”, as it was made by the Dutch. “Our country has silently legalized sex outside of marriage, rape of men and sex between same-sex couples,” he told the bench. “Our law has been so liberal because we have allowed it to be like that for too long. Is that what we want?” Rizieq Shihab, the firebrand FPI leader, could have said the same thing, but he is not a law professor. Rizieq obviously lacks the authority to sway the opinions of Constitutional Court justices. Hamid, on the other hand, is a card-carrying constitutional law expert. It is no surprise that some of the Constitutional Court justices seem to agree with what he said. For years, the FPI has been a thorn in the side of democratic Indonesia, but it has always been on the fringe. Many Muslims, even conservative ones, have been alienated by its despicable antics. I have no doubt that if a foreigner asks affluent, educated and conservative Muslims whether the FPI could be the face of Indonesian Islam today, they will quickly say no. But a different answer may come up if they are asked about AILA. The group is mainstream in so many ways. Not only does it have a much more benign moniker and a much more sophisticated social media strategy than a vigilante group like the FPI, it is also supported by the educated, including professors, and is working within the legal corridor. Its stated goal — strengthening families — is so mainstream that its legal move at the Constitutional Court has received the backing of the Indonesian Child Protection Commission (KPAI), which has argued that casual sex should be banned to protect Indonesian children. But this does not mean AILA does not have the same goal as the FPI, which is to create a moralistic, religious state. AILA’s chairman, Bachtiar Nasir, is the secretary-general of the Council of Young Indonesian Intellectuals and Ulemas (MIUMI) and a graduate from the Islamic University of Medina in Saudi Arabia. Bachtiar has long been rallying against homosexuality on religious grounds. “Learn from history. Religion says the Sodomites were cursed by God and were destroyed. We have to believe that there will be an epic disaster if we condone the LGBTs,” he said in reference to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, as quoted by republika.co.id. That said, despite its secular name, the so-called Family Love Alliance is evidently motivated by the same religious zeal as the FPI. The only difference is that they have greater public support, the patience and the know-how to achieve their goals through painstaking, but more effective, legal means. The Constitutional Court, which has leaned toward conservatism in the past few years, has shown indications it will accept at least part of their petition. In any case, they will not stop at the court. The House of Representatives is concurrently deliberating a revision to the Criminal Code, and AILA members have started lobbying legislators to push their agenda. With greater legitimacy, something the FPI is clearly lacking, AILA has become an effective driving force of conservatism and, therefore, a much bigger threat to civil liberties than some random raids by FPI militants every Ramadhan. So maybe you need to save your daily complaints about Rizieq and his minions on Facebook. The culture war between Indonesian progressives and their retrograde rivals has been taken to a whole new level, with the latter now taking the battle from the blogoshpere to the legal sphere. And, be warned, this battle will be decisive.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/08/30/why-aila-a-bigger-threat-freedom-fpi.html,,2016
"Fri, September 2 2016",Arguing with irrationality is a waste of time,"Abraham Lincoln once said it is “better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt,” but when confronted with evil we may want to take a more active stance, such as the one illustrated by Edmund Burke who said “the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing”. Decisions made based on both points-of-view may be a way out when arguing with irrationality. When figures from the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) visited the office of Kompas to seek “clarification” over its reports of the Public Order Agency (Satpol PP) having confiscated an elderly woman’s foodstuff because she opened her stall during Ramadhan in Serang, Banten, we learned that Kompas answered with wisdom and good negotiation skills. Despite a lengthy video of the meeting on YouTube that mostly shows FPI’s rants and insinuations, Kompas ’ answer was brief, stating its appreciation for FPI’s input and call for a dialogue and partnership to ensure a fair and unbiased coverage of events. The newspaper’s own coverage of the visit was minor, with just a paragraph of explanation accompanied by a photograph. Kompas’ limited coverage was not a sign of apathy, weakness or giving in; rather, it was the correct thing to do. Roger Fisher and William Ury said in their seminal book on negotiations, Getting to Yes, that a good negotiator argues based on interest; in the case of Kompas , to deliver trustworthy, unbiased news versus FPI’s desire for publicity. Both parties got what they wanted. Kompas continued to broadcast trustworthy, unbiased news while FPI got their time in the spotlight without turning violent. Imagine the results if the parties argued based on positions, i.e. “Kompas has the right to broadcast news as it sees it” versus “FPI will fight any coverage seen as defamation against Islam.” Some may argue that such a low-key approach may not be sufficient to rid the world of extreme radicalism. Negotiations would only work if the parties involved could identify interests, as negotiations could then revolve around such interests, subsequently leading to an amiable resolution or at least BATNA (Fisher and Ury’s term for Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement). The Indonesian and Philippine governments did manage to release earlier this year Indonesian sailors held hostage by militants in the Philippines, and they did so through diplomacy, not force; and when Somali pirates, holding an Indonesian vessel and its crew hostage in 2011, demanded high figures in a negotiated ransom, Indonesian armed forces stormed in, killing several pirates before rescuing the crew. As a rule, governments are dissuaded to negotiate with terrorists, but as the examples above show, the initial response should first be to try and negotiate, with the use of lethal force only a last resort. Saying or doing nothing is only valid if the decision is based on conscious and strategic forethought, rather than to merely averse being involved. Burke’s quote is relevant to the hesitance of numerous nations in taking action during the Rwandan civil war in 1994. Had the United Nations interfered earlier in the crisis, millions could have been saved from genocide. What good would negotiations do when facing an irrational opponent? Irrational in this context refers to the interests or reasons of one’s arguments or fight. If the reasons are rational, however trivial, then there is merit in negotiation, as the parties involved could come to a reasonable settlement; but if interests are merely self-serving with a zero-sum positional stance, then negotiations are of no use. Giving in, as the Allies did when they tried to appease Hitler by giving him Czechoslovakia, merely boosted Hitler’s conviction that Nazi Germany could get away with more. Hitler’s interest was not of peace but of conquest. Following the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan, the Taliban, with its brutal implementation of a radical interpretation of Islam, were only fueled to misbehave more, as shown when the group destroyed world heritage sites. Ignoring them did not prevent them from advancing their cause. Instead, they gained global attention. History has taught us that we simply cannot negotiate with irrationality, neither can we ignore it. We can leave the eradication of hardcore terrorists to the security forces, but it is the fledgling radical wannabes that has kept security and law enforcers, psychologists, social scientists, educators and religious experts baffled in terms of knowing how to deal with them. If it were an economic issue, certainly the well-to-do should not be attracted to extremism, yet many are; if it were a matter of intellect, people of higher education should not be prone to fundamentalism, yet a lot of terrorist suspects have college degrees; and if it were a matter of belief, no devout believer would blow themselves up in a crowd of innocent bystanders, yet suicide bombers claim that they do it in the name of God. So, maybe we should change the way we view irrational extremists. When a schizophrenic patient in a psychiatric ward refuses to take his medicine on the grounds that he believes he is Napoleon Bonaparte, the nurse in charge should not try to argue over the credibility of his claim or prove that he is mistaken through DNA testing. The nurse could just continue to encourage the patient to take his medicine, and if coaxing or cajoling does not work then the she could call in reinforcements, strap down the patient and give him a good dose of Risperdal. Note that the nurse is doing this for the good of the patient, and that she is not affected by Napoleon’s charms, demands or threats. The nurse sees a delusional patient and acts on it rather than trying to use rational arguments against the delusion. Normal conversation with the patient would resume after he comes back to reality. In conclusion, it would be futile to negotiate or argue against an irrational counterpart. When religious fundamentalists attack peaceful interfaith demonstrators, harass interfaith events or burn houses of worship from other faiths, we should not attempt to reason with them. Any intellectual challenge to these extremist groups would be a waste of time as their reasoning is irrational. It may even be harmful to purposely provoke a reaction that they could use as an excuse to “defend” themselves. The media should also avoid giving extremist groups publicity, as there are no intellectual benefits in listening to their arguments. Government and security forces should simply enforce the law upon these extremists whenever they act out violently, instead of trying to negotiate based on reason, let alone by giving in to their irrational demands. __________________________________________ The writer is the head of strategies at Karsa Ide Karya and teaches advertising and marketing at the University of Indonesia.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/09/02/arguing-with-irrationality-a-waste-time.html,,2016
"Sat, October 29 2016",Greater Jakarta: FPI chief reported for insulting Pancasila,"A daughter of founding president Sukarno, Sukmawati Soekarnoputri, has reported Islam Defenders Front (FPI) chairman Habib Rizieq Shihab to the police for allegedly insulting the state ideology Pancasila. Sukmawati said Rizieq had also insulted the memory of Sukarno. Police criminal investigation division head Comr. Gen. Ari Dono Sukmanto said the report had been registered and police investigators would process it. “We will process all reports and we will ask for information from whoever files the report,” Ari Dono said as quoted by Antara news agency. He said Sukmawati reported Habib for allegedly insulting the state symbols on various websites, including YouTube. A forensic team would trace the YouTube video and police investigators would question both Sukmawati and Rizieq and a number of witnesses in relation to the case.

"Sat, October 29 2016",Your liberal human rights make a glaring omission of universal principles,"If there was a contest to select a poster girl for diversity and minority rights, I am sure I would be on the shortlist. I am a Chinese-Indonesian, I grew up Catholic and ended my teenage years not subscribing to any religion, and I am a woman. And although my family is middle class, we are not a wealthy Chinese-Indonesian family. I am not only still standing, exuding all my minority charms but I speak about these issues a lot. I write about it too, and not only to defend Chinese-Indonesians’ rights, but also other minority groups like Ahmadis, Shiites and Papuans. I once considered myself a “liberal” and didn’t have any problem with it until lately when liberals, most of them educated middle-class people and my friends, have made a glaring omission of the universal principle of human rights. These people are avid supporters of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, a Chinese-Indonesian and a Christian, thus their rhetoric of pluralism has been cheapened by some people’s attempts to usher Ahok into victory in the gubernatorial election next year. Their campaign that Ahok’s triumph would be a victory for pluralism leaves a bad taste in my mouth, especially because Ahok has actually done little to protect freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and pluralism. His only commendable action was saying public schools in Jakarta were prohibited from making the hijab mandatory. Others laud him for his bravery against hard-line group the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and many of my friends cheered when Ahok said the FPI should be disbanded without realizing that it was actually a violation of the Constitution, Article 28I paragraph 1 on freedom of assembly and expressing opinion to be exact. But these people were silent when the FPI wrought havoc in December last year, raiding private cars in the Taman Ismail Marzuki (TIM) cultural center in Central Jakarta to find the FPI’s archenemy, Purwakarta Regent Dedi Mulyadi. Then Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Tito Karnavian (now the National Police chief) refused to reprimand his subordinates who allowed this to happen before their eyes. And Ahok said nothing about that. From November 2015 until March this year, under Tito’s leadership there were at least five incidents threatening freedom of assembly and expression in Jakarta, most of which involved the FPI or other firebrand groups. While Tito seemed to condone the actions, Ahok, as the No. 1 person in Jakarta, was silent. And liberals continue to promote Ahok as a symbol of pluralism, only because he was seemingly “brave” in facing the FPI, but under closer scrutiny has actually done nothing except stand still, exude his minority charms and fire expletives from his mouth. I can see that this could be cathartic because he defies the stereotype of mousy, prostrate Chinese-Indonesians in the face of hard liners. But really, I could do that too if I had tanks and a Mobile Brigade (Brimob) troop at the ready every day in front of my office and three layers of security in my gated community. Actually, all my life I have been to places known for their anti-Chinese sentiment unescorted. The liberals focus so much on the FPI, which is actually a fringe organization that should have been kept on the fringe. This focus feels increasingly wrong amid rampant evictions in Jakarta and obvious violations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which Indonesia has ratified. Ahok’s neo-developmentalism, at the expense of an economic minority who happens to be the majority religion and ethnicity wise, has bulldozed homes and displaced children and women, who always bear more of the brunt of this tragedy. It is also a systematic dispossession of the poor. It seems that your liberal human rights do not have the capacity to extend compassion to the city’s economic minority. The liberals have been whitewashing all this by saying that the urban poor are treated “humanely” because they are moved to low-cost rental apartments equipped with sitting toilets, shiny mosques and garbage chutes, while dismissing the fact that these people have been uprooted from an economically strategic location to one with much less economic activity. They have also dismissed the fact that the forced evictions themselves have been brutal and done without dialogue, a requirement even in the framework of the neoliberal World Bank. They actively vilify the poor with unjustified labels like “robbers of state land”, while at the same time taking pride in themselves as defenders of minority rights. This is a glaring omission, very middle-class biased and dangerous for the future of Jakarta, a city already segregated by economic caste. These are the same people who shared the World Bank report about inequality on social media and lauded Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati when she delivered a speech about inequality and structural poverty, all the while encouraging Ahok to evict more people. He has already vowed to clean Jakarta from the great unwashed before the Asian Games in 2018. This means thousands more families are to undergo dispossession and displacement and they say Ahok’s victory means the victory of pluralism. I used to be proud of calling myself a liberal. Now, I am not so sure anymore. ______________________________ The author is staff writer with The Jakarta Post.

"Tue, November 1 2016","Jokowi, Prabowo call for calm ahead of rally","All the pretty horses: President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo (left) and Gerindra Party chairman Prabowo Subianto take time out on horseback at the latter’s residential retreat in Bojong Koneng, Bogor, West Java, on Monday. The former presidential election rivals reportedly had a relaxed discussion about politics and national issues.(Courtesy of Warta Kota) The mood was jovial. When asked to ride a horse, a sturdy stallion called Salero, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo amused his host, Gerindra Party chairman Prabowo Subianto, with a typical self-deprecating joke. “This is a very big horse and I am very light. I saw the horse giving me a smile,” Jokowi said, referring to his slender physique. “He certainly has one advantage. He is light and horses like light riders,” Prabowo responded affirmatively. Later in the living room of Prabowo’s spacious ranch in Hambalang, Bogor, West Java, the topic of conversation was anything but light. Jokowi visited Prabowo, his former rival in the 2014 presidential election and leader of the opposition camp, to ask him to join in calling on political groups to ease tensions ahead of a Nov. 4 rally organized by Muslim groups. The groups have called for the prosecution of incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja “Ahok” Purnama for alleged blasphemy. The planned rally, a follow-up to a chaotic street protest on Oct. 21, which was spearheaded by the firebrand Islam Defenders Front (FPI), will call for the imprisonment of Ahok for insulting the Quran. If the plan materializes, it would effectively ban Ahok from seeking reelection in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election. FPI leader Rizieq Syihab has called for schools, businesses and government offices to close on Friday, urging people to join the rally. Senior politicians from Prabowo’s Gerindra Party and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), including House of Representatives Deputy Speaker Fadli Zon and outspoken lawmaker Fahri Hamzah, are expected to attend. In a statement after their meeting, Prabowo said he agreed with the President on the need “to maintain unity and guard against those who want to divide the country”. “We are a plural country with many tribes, religions and races. If we have problems, let’s solve them peacefully,” Prabowo said, adding that he shared Jokowi’s concerns about possible security threats at the planned rally. “Among other things, I am concerned about the security developments and I have to deliver my views to him because he is the country’s commander in chief. I am always ready to give input to the government when needed,” Prabowo said. Speaking after Prabowo, Jokowi declined to refer directly to the rally and only said that religious and political leaders should do more to ease tension related to regional elections. “I agreed with what has been said by Pak Prabowo. Religious and political leaders should join forces to cool down the situation,” Jokowi said. Jokowi also said the talk was a follow-up to a meeting in 2014 that took place shortly before he was inaugurated as president. The two politicians met again in January 2015 in the early months of Jokowi’s administration, when the ruling Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) was threatening to withdraw its support from Jokowi’s presidency, following his decision to postpone the inauguration of Comr. Gen. Budi Gunawan, a former aide of PDI-P matriarch Megawati Soekarnoputri, as National Police chief. After his meeting with Prabowo, Jokowi was scheduled to hold talks with several Muslim leaders, asking them to contribute to calls for peace during the simultaneous regional elections in 2017. On Tuesday, Jokowi is scheduled to meet with leaders from Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah, the country’s largest and second largest Islamic organizations, respectively, to discuss the Nov. 4 rally. Political analyst Gun Gun Heryanto of the Political Literacy Institute said Jokowi recognized that tensions had reached such an alarming level that he needed Prabowo to amplify his message. “When the two leaders meet, it usually takes place in situations where political tension is at its highest. From today’s meeting, I see that Jokowi knows well from whom he could seek help to calm down tensions, which result from sectarianism ahead of the Jakarta election,” Gun Gun said. Despite warnings from Prabowo, House Deputy Speaker Fadli said he would not call off his plan to participate in the rally as the meeting between his party chairman and Jokowi had nothing to do with the planned rally or the Jakarta election. “The rally is not about politics, but about law enforcement against Ahok. The President’s meeting with Pak Prabowo is a regular get-together, following Jokowi’s promise in 2014 that he would visit Hambalang,” Fadli said. House Speaker Ade Komarudin, a Golkar Party lawmaker, said the meeting between Jokowi and Prabowo could contribute to easing tensions in the capital. “When two influential elites from two rival parties can sit together, it really helps deliver a message to calm down the current situation, because party members at the grassroots level can easily follow their actions,” Ade said. ___________________________ To receive comprehensive and earlieraccess to The Jakarta Post print edition, please subscribe to our epaperthrough iOS' iTunes, Android's Google Play, Blackberry World or Microsoft'sWindows Store.

"Thu, November 3 2016",More Muslim groups to join anti-Ahok rally,"Duty calls: Members of the police’s elite Mobile Brigade (Brimob) pray at the National Monument in Jakarta on Wednesday ahead of their deployment to secure the planned Nov. 4 rally.(JP/Seto Wardhana) As hundreds of Islamic hard-liners leave their hometowns to join a planned rally in Jakarta on Friday, the police and military have flexed their muscles, showing off thousands of personnel ready to secure the demonstration. Protesters in some regions, however, decided to hold simultaneous demonstrations in nearby cities, expanding the scale of the tensions to the national level, with security concerns raised across the archipelago. Hundreds of people reportedly left Bandung, West Java, on Wednesday to join the Nov. 4 rally in Jakarta, which is aimed at demanding the prosecution of gubernatorial candidate and incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama for blasphemy. West Java Islamic Movement Alliance head Asep Syaripudin said 11 buses and 23 cars had left for Jakarta so far. He said the demonstrators came from different groups, such as the Indonesian Muslim Student Action Union, the Greater Bandung Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and the Islamic Reform Movement. He added that they came from areas across the province, including Sumedang, Garut, Tasikmalaya, Ciamis and Pangandaran regencies. Separately, the leader of the FPI’s Karawang chapter, Ade Dahyar, said the organization would send at least 400 of its members. FPI members from Jambi will also join the rally in Jakarta. “As many as 162 FPI members from Jambi will depart on Thursday to join FPI members from all over Indonesia,” Jambi FPI regional representative board secretary Abdullah Hamid said on Wednesday. In Pekanbaru, Riau, thousands of hard-liners claimed they would hold a rally in the provincial capital. The Pekanbaru Police said they had received a proposal from Islamic organizations to stage a rally that could see over 2,000 demonstrators hit the city’s streets. Pekanbaru Police chief Sr. Comr. Toni Hermawan said some 500 personnel would secure the rally. Separately, head of the Religious Affairs Ministry’s Riau office, Ahmad Supardi Hasibuan, said he had gathered all executives of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) from across the province to discuss the planned rally, as he had heard that hundreds of Muslims from Riau would also depart for Jakarta. Pekanbaru city councilor Mulyadi was among those intending to join the peaceful rally in Jakarta. “I am already in Jakarta. We are not being paid for the rally. This is purely my personal intent,” the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) politician said. Similar rallies are reportedly set to take place in other cities, such as Makassar and Surabaya. In Jakarta, some 5,000 personnel from the National Police, the Indonesian Military (TNI) and the Jakarta Public Order Agency (Satpol PP) gathered at the National Monument in Central Jakarta on Wednesday. They were part of 18,000 personnel being readied ahead of the rally. National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian and TNI commander Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo attended the briefing to signal the level of attention they are giving the issue, as the threat of violence continues to loom. Several personnel from the West Java Police were also seen at the ceremony wearing white Muslim caps and clothing over their police attire. They are to be deployed at the forefront of the rally. Tito said the meeting was primarily intended to ensure that the personnel were ready to secure the capital for the upcoming gubernatorial election, but highlighted the Nov. 4 rally as a phase of the campaign that could potentially “create violence”. “It is different in Jakarta, where citizens are now becoming polarized and have their own interests,” Tito told reporters after the meeting. He said he hoped the rally would run “smoothly and peacefully”, adding that police personnel set to secure the rally would not carry guns or live bullets, and would instead be equipped with non-lethal weapons such as water cannons and tear gas. “We have prepared [all of the measures] just in case [there is a riot], you know. We always think of the worst scenario,” Tito said.

"Fri, November 4 2016",Weekly 5: When protests in Jakarta turn ugly,"JP/Jerry Adiguna As the nation’s capital, Jakarta is the center of government, business and media. It is no wonder then that Jakarta is often a popular place for citizens to vent their anger and protest. However, not all protests are peaceful. The protest in 1998 turned into a riot, leading to casualties. Here are five recent protests that disintegrated into riots, causing injuries and vandalism. FPI versus Ahok Today’s protest against incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahja Purnama will not be the first. Hard-liner group Islam Defenders Front (FPI) protested the inauguration of Ahok as governor after Joko “Jokowi” Widodo was elected President in October 2014. The protesters demanded that Ahok step down from his position as he was Chinese and Christian. Ahok was not present during the protest. He was attending the opening ceremony of the Asian Games in South Korea. The protest in front of City hall caused injury to 10 police officers after they were pelted with rocks by FPI protesters. The police arrested two coordinators of the protest and another FPI member. Kampung Pulo eviction On Aug. 20, 2015, Kampung Pulo turned into something akin to a war-zone after the city administration refused to negotiate with residents living on the banks of the Ciliwung River in South Jakarta and decided to simply demolish their houses. Protesters, mostly youngsters, turned into an angry mob after the administration’s refusal to engage in dialogue. They started to throw stones at more than 2,000 security personnel from the Jakarta Police, the military and the Public Order Agency (Satpol PP). The security personnel advanced and demolished houses on 519 land plots. Dozens of people were injured, two motorcycles were broken and an excavator was set on fire in the clash. The police unleashed tear gas to empty out the location. The gas ended up affecting the elderly and children who were still trying to move their belongings. The police apprehended 27 people allegedly involved in the clash, some of whom were severely beaten. Taxi drivers versus Go-jek drivers A protest by at least 10,000 drivers, mostly taxi drivers, against ride-hailing apps such as Go-jek, US-based Uber and Malaysia-based Grab turned into a brawl at many spots in the capital in March. Taxi drivers and Go-Jek drivers who met on Jl. Sudirman during the protest engaged in a brawl by throwing rocks at each other. The incident caused a standstill on Jl. Sudirman until police officers broke up the brawl and forced the groups to retreat. Meanwhile, a Go-Jek driver was forced by taxi drivers to get off his motorcycle while he was passing through Senayan wearing his Go-Jek jacket and helmet. He was punched in the face, and suffered facial bruises. A taxi driver was also beaten up by Go-jek drivers in a separate brawl, also in the Senayan area. Furthermore, several Go-jek drivers broke the windows on angkot (public minivans) with their helmets in Kota Tua in retaliation, forcing the angkots stop operating. Wage rage A demonstration in front of the State Palace on Oct. 30, 2015, demanding that the government revise a regulation on the annual minimum wage determination mechanism ended with the arrest of 24 workers, some of whom had refused to leave after the regulated rally hours. As many as two activists from the Jakarta Legal Aid Institute (LBH Jakarta) also reportedly suffered from serious injuries when the police violently dispersed the protesters. An existing regulation dictated that the demonstration had to end at 6 p.m. and police officers warned the protesters to immediately leave Jl. Medan Merdeka Utara, in front of State Palace, at 6:30 p.m. Around 2,000 protesters left the location after the warning, but some 3,000 workers remained in place. A third warning was delivered at 7:15 p.m. and finally, the police used force to disperse the protesters after a water canon failed to expel them from the street. The vast majority of protesters left after tear gas was used, but 24 workers remained. Some 12,000 workers from Jakarta and its surrounding cities demonstrated in front of the State Palace, and many of them wanted to spend the night on the street and await a government response to their demands. FPI attack Members of the FPI attacked National Alliance for Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) activists who were holding a rally to commemorate the 63rd anniversary of Pancasila at the National Monument (Monas) in Central Jakarta in June 2008. The incident injured 34 people. The AKKBB earlier announced the event to the public through newspapers, saying that they endorsed pluralism. The AKKBB called on the country to respect different beliefs and protect minorities who practiced different belief systems, such as the Ahmadiyah sect. Thousands of Ahmadiyah followers in the country now live under constant threat of violence and discrimination after being declared blasphemous by several hard-line groups. FPI spokesman Munarman told radio reporters at the time that the incident was a reaction to the alliance’s offensive statement in several newspapers. The police deployed 1,200 officers but did not arrest anyone in the incident. The attack was quickly condemned by human rights activists, politicians and the Muslim organizations Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama (NU).",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/11/04/weekly-5-when-protests-jakarta-turn-ugly.html,,2016
"Sat, November 5 2016",Rally erupts in violence,"Blazing anger: A police truck burns during the rally against Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama in Jakarta on Friday. After violence erupted near the State Palace, looting was reported in Penjaringan, an area in the vicinity of Ahok’s private home, and in Luar Batang, both in North Jakarta.(JP/Seto Wardhana) A massive rally calling for the criminal prosecution of Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja “Ahok” Purnama for alleged blasphemy ended in violence on Friday night as protesters defied a police order to disperse. At midnight, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo praised the rally’s Muslim leaders for keeping the rally in order during the day. “However, we regretted the violence in the evening. Political actors took advantage of this situation,” he said. The President further stated that the legal process against Ahok would take place in a transparent fashion. The anti-Ahok rally ran peacefully early in the day, but soon after dusk, violence broke out following a scuffle involving a small number of protesters, who were allegedly members of the Muslim Students Association (HMI) and activists from the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), the firebrand Islamic organization that played a leading role in Friday’s protest. In a strange turn of events, the FPI joined forces with the police at one point to call for the HMI students to disperse and not to get closer to the State Palace. As the scuffle broke out between the riot police and the alleged HMI students, unidentified protesters torched three police trucks parked on the corner of Monas Square. In the midst of the chaotic situation, the police started firing tear gas and used water canons to disperse the crowd. Learning about the clash, hundreds of protesters, who were on their way back to Istiqlal Mosque, started streaming back to the area near the State Palace. Three police officer was reported to have been injured in the confrontation. Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Wiranto went down to the protest site near the State Palace soon after 9 p.m. to calm down the protesters. “They should have all dispersed. They know me, they should have calmed down. Back off,” Wiranto told the protesters. Some of the protesters retreated and headed toward the House of Representatives complex. Earlier this week, People’s Consultative Assembly (MPR) Speaker Zulkifli Hasan, a National Mandate Party (PAN) politician, said the compound would be open to protesters who wanted to spend the night there after the protest. Earlier on in the protest, signs promoting violence could be seen in the crowd, which was composed of a number of Muslim groups. Some of the signs used strong language to condemn Ahok’s statements about a verse in the Quran, which the protestors deemed as insulting to the Muslim faith. Carrying banners reading “prosecute Ahok,” “arrest Ahok,” and “Ahok go home,” some groups in the crowd threatened Ahok with death. Marching on: Muslims march along Jl. MH Thamrin during a rally in Jakarta on Friday. Around 100,000 Muslims took to the streets on Friday demanding the prosecution of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama for alleged blasphemy. They called on the police to immediately detain Ahok.(JP/Wendra Ajistyatama) Some protesters gathered in front of Istiqlal Mosque were caught on camera chanting “bunuh, bunuh si Ahok sekarang juga” (kill, kill Ahok right now).” Elsewhere, near Gambir Station, a group of protesters hung a makeshift banner bearing the words: “gantung Ahok disini” (Hang Ahok right here). While the majority of the more than 100,000 protesters who showed up for the anti-Ahok rally were concentrated around the State Palace, a small number of protesters managed to reach the residential area of Pantai Mutiara, Pluit, North Jakarta, where Ahok lives. The crowd failed to enter the residential complex, which was heavily guarded by scores of personnel from the Jakarta Police and the Indonesian Military (TNI). The protestors could only chant “Ahok, get out,”. The protesters carried a banner reading “Laskar Masjid Luar Batang” (Luar Batang Mosque Militia). Luar Batang residents have been in dispute with the Jakarta administration following the city’s plan to demolish houses in the area as part of the revitalization of the mosque for religious tourism. The Friday protest went smoothly during the day without any incidents and the majority of the protesters left the demonstration grounds before 6 p.m., the deadline given by the Jakarta Police for the rally. Some of the protestors enjoyed the festive mood of the demonstration. The security authorities have been credited for taking measures aimed at easing tensions. Along the way from Istiqlal Mosque, where the protesters gathered for Friday prayers, to the State Palace, food and drinks provided by the FPI were easily available for the marchers. “The supplies were delivered by the leaders at our headquarters in Petamburan [in Central Jakarta],” said Anwar, an FPI member. Anwar said he did not know who had financed the purchase of the food. Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Mochamad Iriawan said that in order to prevent possible clashes, on-duty police personnel were not allowed to use firearms or bayonets. Police personnel were also instructed to chant the Asmaul Husna (the 99 names of God) to calm down the crowd if they became violent. The Jakarta Police also dispatched dozens of female officers wearing hijabs to stand guard in front of the State Palace in the hope of calming protesters. It was at this peaceful stage of the rally that leaders of the demonstration tried to negotiate their way into the State Palace to meet with the President. But because Jokowi, who on Thursday pledged to remain at the palace during the rally, decided to go to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang, Banten, for an impromptu visit to check on the progress of the construction of a railway network linking downtown Jakarta with the airport, the leaders of the demonstration could only meet with Wiranto. Religious Affairs Minister Lukman Hakim Saifuddin also attempted to talk with the protesters. At around 3 p.m., however, the protesters declined to negotiate with Wiranto and insisted on meeting with Jokowi. “Yes, I am representing the government. We are representing the government,” Wiranto told the leaders, referring also to Lukman Hakim, National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian and Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung. The rally leaders declined to talk with Wiranto and left the grounds of the State Palace. “I can’t [go on]. I’m just a messenger,” said Muslim cleric Bachtiar Nasir, one of the rally’s leaders. Later in the afternoon, the protest leaders agreed to meet with Vice President Jusuf Kalla at his office on Jl. Medan Merdeka Utara in the vicinity of the State Palace. Speaking after the meeting, Kalla said the investigation into the alleged blasphemy case implicating Ahok would be completed within two weeks. “Our conclusion is that in the case involving Ahok, we will uphold the law indiscriminately and it will be completed within two weeks,” Kalla told reporters. Tito earlier said that the National Police’s Criminal Investigation Department had scheduled a questioning session for Nov. 7 and would soon summon Ahok.

"Sat, November 5 2016","COMMENTARY: Questioning our pride as a democratic, tolerant and peaceful nation","We have long prided ourselves as the world’s third largest democracy after India and the US, and the country with the world’s largest Muslim population. The international community and global media outlets often describe Indonesia’s version of Islam as peaceful, tolerant and moderate. We boast that violent, intolerant and radical Muslim groups are very small in number and influence. We believe that the country’s two major Muslim organizations, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah, are the legitimate standard-bearers of Islam in Indonesia. We like to think that we are a pluralist society, a nation built on a foundation that disregards skin color, ethnicity and faith. We submit to the belief that we, as Indonesians, cling to the idea of “unity in diversity”. On Friday, we woke up to the disturbing reality that we haven’t progressed very far from nativism and tribalism. The Nov. 4 rally has exposed some of the ugliest parts of our politics, where skin color, ethnicity and faith become weapons to attack political rivals. With the presence of incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja “Ahok” Purnama, a Christian and a Chinese-Indonesian, it is easy to see and hear the racist undertones in the political campaigns of his rivals. While the demonstration proceeded peacefully, at least until the evening, it was shocking to see some protesters shouting horrifying phrases such as “kill Ahok”, or displaying posters reading: “Wanted: Ahok, dead or alive”. Where were the leaders of NU and Muhammadiyah on Friday? Where were the leaders of the major political parties supporting Ahok’s reelection bid? The mass protest was led by people widely known for their dislike, if not hatred, of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo. Indeed, the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) led the rally, and lead the anti-Ahok movement. FPI leader, Rizieq Shihab, an Indonesian of Arab descent, seems to have a personal grudge against Ahok, because the Jakarta governor is the only state official in the country who has the guts to demand that the central government dissolve the FPI. In the lead-up to Friday’s rally, scores of Ahok’s political rivals put Jakarta’s gubernatorial election in the context of a “holy war”, or crusade against an infidel, with people such as former Muhammadiyah chairman Amien Rais urging Muslims not to vote for Ahok because he is a dajjal (a kind of anti-Christ). Earlier this week, while flanked by a number of policemen, a protester, dressed in full Islamic garb, made a long speech and offered to give Rp 1 billion (US$76,900) to anyone who could kill Ahok if the incumbent governor visited certain areas in West Jakarta. Shortly after the speech, Ahok was forced to flee from a neighborhood in Rawa Belong in a public minivan after a group of protesters started to taunt him and demand that he leave the area where he was campaigning. On Friday, protesters hung a massive banner reading “Hang Ahok Right Now” from a pedestrian bridge near Gambir Station. And the saddest part of this whole episode is that more than 100,000 people bowed to this violent rhetoric and showed up for the Nov. 4 rally. The Jakarta election should be about the programs that the candidates are proposing to solve the myriad of problems plaguing the capital, from severe traffic congestion and pollution to garbage collection problems, reclamation controversies and housing for the poor. But since the campaign period began in mid-October, we have heard nothing but calls for Ahok to drop out from the race on allegations that he insulted the Quran. And nothing fires up the political base of Ahok’s rivals more than allegations that he insulted Islam. The rivals of Ahok, who will certainly reap huge political gains if Ahok drops out of the race as a result of Friday’s rally, certainly share some of the blame for fanning primordial sentiments to get what they want. All of us, however, should take responsibility for allowing such sectarian sentiments to grow and fester in our democracy. We have been complacent for too long, happy to think that the movements against Ahok, and those groups responsible for acts of intolerance and violence in this country, are only fringe groups who matter little in politics. On Friday, we were proved wrong. These groups now hold the keys to the Jakarta gubernatorial election and, probably, the success or failure of our experiment in democracy. The sharp-tongued Ahok often provokes anger for his direct manner. However, it is hard to deny, even for his most hostile foes, that under his leadership, Jakarta has progressed and improved. But the allegations that Ahok’s programs are beneficial to the middle and upper-income class of people, many of whom are Chinese-Indonesians and non-Muslims, and harmful to lower-income citizens, are also not totally baseless. It is a brute reality that there are Muslims who do not want to have a non-Muslim leader. Many Muslims complain that they are a majority in this country, but a minority in terms of economic access. It is also understandable that many non-Muslims fight as die-hard supporters for the reelection of Ahok because for a long time they have felt, rightly or wrongly, that they are second-class citizens in this country. Some of them even believe that Jesus sent Ahok to save Jakarta, and later, if elected president, Indonesia. No one can touch Ahok because God will not allow anyone to harm him, their thinking goes. The leaders of mainstream religious or political organizations are out of touch with the social and political reality. They belittle the role of small organizations such as the FPI. Is this because they are too afraid to confront the intimidation and intolerance of the FPI and their ilk, or because Indonesia’s mainstream leaders actually agree with these small groups?",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/11/05/commentary-questioning-our-pride-a-democratic-tolerant-and-peaceful-nation.html,,2016
"Mon, November 7 2016",Violence stems from inter-ethnic tensions,"Trail of vandalism: A mini market on Jl. Gedong Panjang, Penjaringan, North Jakarta, is still closed on Sunday. The retail vendor became a target of unruly demonstrators following the Nov. 4 rally that demanded the prosecution of Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama on allegations of blasphemy.(JP/Donny Fernando) Pre-existing inter-ethnic tensions could explain the looting and violence that broke out in majority Chinese-Indonesian areas in North Jakarta on Friday night. Police also say the violence had nothing to do with the massive rally held by Muslim groups on the same day. The rioting was likely fueled by existing tensions in the area and initiated by local mobs taking advantage of the situation caused by the religious rally in Central Jakarta, historian from Pelita Harapan University Yosef M. Djakababa said. “It is the excess that arises and can occasionally explode, such as it did on Friday, because of long existing seeds of suspicion between communities in the area,” Yosef said on Sunday. Relations between different ethnic groups in Indonesia more or less have their roots in the colonial period, including the division of different regions and the make-up of their populations, he said. However, he expressed regret that ethnic tension remained in some areas. The government and local figures must also facilitate communication and interaction between residents in the area to ease pre-existing tensions and avoid further clashes, Yosef said. “The government must be present, and the communities in the locations must continue to work hard to reduce mutual suspicion, and that is not attained by building higher walls in residential areas,” he said. Meanwhile, sociologist from state University of Indonesia Ricardi S. Adnan noted that trauma from 1998 was still too significant to allow a repeat of such events, adding that the rally had attempted to stay focused on its main goal, which was to demand that the police prosecute Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama for alleged blasphemy. However, Ricardi continued, crowds could be breeding grounds for out-of-control incidents. “In a crowd situation, there is always a risk of actions that are beyond control, as well as other parties who take advantage of a violent situation for their own gain,” he said. The police on Sunday named 13 suspects for their alleged involvement in the riot in Penjaringan, North Jakarta. “Twelve people were initially declared suspects and we named another one after further investigation,” Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Awi Setiyono said in a statement on Sunday. Besides naming 13 suspects, Awi said police had also put 16 names on a wanted list for their alleged involvement in the riot. On Saturday, at least 10 businesses were recorded as being victims of the attacks. They included two convenience stores, an Alfamart and an Indomaret, and Bakso Tukul, a meatball soup outlet owned by well-known comedian Tukul Arwana. Police lines have been set up around the area, located in front of the Pakin Transjakarta bus station, while as of Saturday night broken glass was still scattered around. People also pelted stones at police officers when the looting broke out at around 7:30 p.m. Paryanto, 35, a field coordinator for vendors in Jl. Gedong Panjang in Penjaringan, said that most of the vendors affected were not traumatized by the invasion of hundreds of looters, but regretted their losses which were estimated to reach hundreds of millions of rupiah. Meanwhile, despite initial fears residents of the Chinatown area of Glodok in West Jakarta, said they would keep their businesses open as usual but would stay alert. Ahok, a Christian and Indonesian of Chinese descent, has sparked uproar among Muslim groups after he made a comment about a verse of the Quran during a visit to the Thousand Islands regency in late September. At least 100,000 people swarmed the streets of Central Jakarta demanding the outspoken governor be prosecuted over his allegedly blasphemous remarks.

"Thu, November 10 2016",President reaches out to more Islamic groups,"President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo tried to reach out to more Muslim groups on Wednesday to seek their support in lessening the anger over the blasphemy allegedly committed by Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama. The allegation sparked nationwide protests last Friday, forcing the President to postpone a state visit to Sydney and Canberra, Australia. After visiting Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) on Monday and Muhammadiyah on Tuesday, Jokowi invited 17 other Islamic organizations to the State Palace for a dialogue. The groups — among others, Al-Washliyah, the Tarbiyah Islamiyah Association (Perti), the Indonesian Islamic Preaching Council (DDII), the Islam Union (Persis), Al-Irsyad Al-Islamiyyah and Syarikat Islam — were established before independence and played a part in the nation’s history. “Because the President believed there are [Muslims] who still feel the pain and [such a feeling] is normal, we are trying to calm them [as] the President has promised to be fair [in this matter],” Yusnar Yusuf of Al-Washliyah said. “[The President] indeed showed seriousness in the meeting,” said Yusnar, who revealed that initially he doubted Jokowi would act fairly. The Wednesday meeting at the palace did not involve the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) or the Muslim Students Association (HMI). The FPI had spearheaded the anti-Ahok rally in Jakarta, which saw more than 100,000 people swarming Jakarta’s streets, while HMI members have been charged with instigating violence during the rally. The President has instructed the National Police to conduct a fair and transparent investigation, as rumors were rife that another protest would be held on Nov. 25. Yusnar said he could not promise there would not be another rally and that the groups have yet to hear information about one. “We should see first [if another rally occurs]. What actions could we take? What would be the problem, the demands and the goals [of the rally]?” Yusnar asked. The President said he was hoping the ulema (muslim scholars) could help calm the public over the blasphemy brouhaha. “Currently, we need calming statements from ulema that will cool down [the situation] amid the various issues and statements that are actually sharpening differences among members of the public,” Jokowi, who earlier expressed hope that there would be no more such rallies in the near future, said in Wednesday’s meeting. Jokowi has said that he will not tamper with the ongoing police investigation into Ahok’s case. “I hope tomorrow, during National Heroes Day, we can maintain unity in all our diversity, remain united in our brotherhood and be an example for the world that we can build a diverse society that lives in harmony,” he added. Separately on Wednesday, the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), which has issued a formal statement accusing Ahok of committing blasphemy, gathered 70 leaders of Islamic organizations across the country and 29 Islamic scholars. The council stands by its contention that Ahok committed blasphemy when he accused people of using a Quranic verse to “deceive” other people to convince them not to vote for him in the gubernatorial election. The chairman of the MUI advisory board, Din Syamsuddin, praised Jokowi’s efforts to initiate political communications to bring him closer to Muslim communities in Indonesia. However, he said in his view the President made his move too late. Besides, he explained, since Jokowi only invited figures from a small number of Indonesian Islamic groups, out of the hundreds spread across the country, the move seemed unfair, especially after he refused to meet with Muslim protesters from other organizations who were involved in the rally on Friday. “I regret [Jokowi’s choice] to refuse to meet [the demonstrators]. The move could be viewed as abandonment or neglect. It should not be like that. It is an injustice when there were other groups invited to the State Palace,” Din said. ----------------- To receive comprehensive and earlier access to The Jakarta Post printedition, please subscribe to our epaper through iOS' iTunes, Android's GooglePlay, Blackberry World or Microsoft's Windows Store.

"Fri, November 11 2016",Ahok calls off campaign despite extensive security,"In a rare sight during an election season, as many as 300 police personnel stood by on Jl. Raya Kedoya Utara in West Jakarta on Thursday, all to safeguard a gubernatorial candidate who wanted to reach out to his voters. The police lineup extended up to 150 meters. The men were armed with helmets, body protectors, shields, batons and long-barreled weapons. Each of them was also equipped with 10 tear gas canisters. Behind them also stood on guard other security forces, including policewomen with headscarves and a number of tactical vehicles such as a Barracuda vehicle and another equipped with a water cannon, kompas.com reported. The large-scale security measures were taken to safeguard Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, who has been facing campaign disruptions and even security threats from Islamists who accuse him of committing blasphemy. But even with the presence of hundreds of security officials, the incumbent candidate still failed to campaign in the area as the police advised him to leave to avoid possible clashes with protesters, some of whom claimed to be members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). “We do not want to taint the election process with violence,” said Bestari Barus, a spokesman from the Ahok-Djarot Saiful Hidayat campaign team, told The Jakarta Post. The Jakarta Police confirmed that they decided to boost security for Ahok’s campaign visit to Kedoya after receiving intelligence of a possible security threat. The police refused to elaborate on how serious the threat was. “Basically, if we are asked about security, we will say that we deploy force based on how many people will come [to the area],” said the Jakarta Police’s spokesman Sr. Comr. Awi Setiyono. Ahok has been dealing with animosity and protests during his campaign visits throughout the capital. Last week, for example, he became the target of an angry mob while he was carrying out a campaign stop in Rawa Belong, West Jakarta. Because of the mob, which turned aggressive, the police forced him to flee in a public minivan. Some days later, more than 100,000 protesters gathered in front of the State Palace to demand that Ahok be prosecuted for alleged blasphemy. Earlier this year, Ahok talked about a verse in the Quran with some residents from Thousand Islands regency. These remarks set off a fire-storm of anger in the country after they were leaked online. The investigation into Ahok’s remarks is ongoing, as promised by the government. Aside from Ahok, Djarot also faced protests last week while visiting a fishing village in Cilincing, North Jakarta, on the back of protests over the eviction programs planned by the city administration. On Wednesday, he confronted a dozen of men wearing Islamic garb in Kembangan Utara, West Jakarta. The men urged Djarot and his team to stop campaigning in the area and leave. Kembangan Utara and Kedoya Utara are known to be FPI territory. Later in the evening, the team immediately reported Wednesday’s protest to the Elections Supervisory Agency (Bawaslu) in order to ensure security for Ahok and Djarot, as well as secure the team’s ability to promote its programs for the city. “[The FPI] was reported last night,” said Bestari. “[With the report], we want to say that we have the right to campaign. If they don’t like us, they can just not choose us.” Jakarta General Elections Commission (KPU Jakarta) chairman Sumarno said it was up to the police to decide whether or not they needed to boost security for Ahok. “It is the police who must examine how precarious the situation is,” he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/11/11/ahok-calls-campaign-despite-extensive-security.html,,2016
"Sat, November 12 2016",Greater Jakarta: City police chief reported to Propam,"The Islamic Students Association (HMI) on Friday reported Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Mochamad Iriawan to the National Police’s internal affairs division (Propam) for allegedly provoking members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) to catch HMI members during a large-scale rally in Jakarta on Nov. 4. HMI chairman Mulyadi P. Tamsir referred to video footage circulating on the internet of a statement Iriawan allegedly made. “We were provoked and pushed into conflict. Therefore, we want justice from the National Police,” said Mulyadi at the National Police headquarters in Jakarta on Friday, as reported by kompas.com. Jakarta Police have clarified Iriawan’s statement, saying it had not been intended for public consumption, because it had been made after the riot broke out on the evening of Nov. 4 while Iriawan had been speaking with FPI leaders, who had promised to catch any rioters during the demonstration. Meanwhile, HMI legal team coordinator Muhammad Syukur Mandar expressed concern about Iriawan’s statement, claiming it not only violated the police’s ethics code, but may offer grounds for a case. “The National Police chief and the President should be consistent in enforcing the law. We have the video and photo as evidence uploaded onto YouTube,” said Syukur, adding that he had prepared six witnesses for the case. The HMI’s accusations come after police arrested and named five HMI members as suspects over the riot on Nov. 4.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/11/12/greater-jakarta-city-police-chief-reported-propam.html,,2016
"Tue, November 15 2016",Ahok to present Egyptian expert in blasphemy case,"National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian revealed on Monday that he had approved the request by Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama to present a renowned Quran interpretation expert from the internationally respected Al-Azhar University in Cairo. Tito said Ahok had the right to bring respected Muslim scholar Seikh Amr al-Wardani from the prestigious university to take part in Ahok’s blasphemy case screeening on Tuesday . “It is based on an invitation from the reported party [Ahok]. I don’t see any problem if he wants to bring an expert from Egypt,” Tito said. Wardani’s planned attendance sparked protests from several Islamic groups, among them the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), who have demanded Ahok be tried for blasphemy and who staged a massive rally in Central Jakarta on Nov. 4. The FPI’s firebrand leader Rizieq Shihab said that it was an insult to the Muslim clerics and experts of Indonesia. Through his personal website, Rizieq said that Wardani’s involvement would damage Al-Azhar’s credibility. “We hope that Wardani will not get involved in Indonesian Muslims’ affairs, because it will tarnish the images of Al-Azhar and Egypt, which are respected in Indonesia,” Rizieq said. The National Police’s Criminal Investigation Department (Bareskrim) will hold the blasphemy case secreening on Tuesday as part of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s promise to settle Ahok’s case within two weeks. As many as 20 language, criminal and religion experts, as well as the 11 parties that have filed a police report against Ahok, have been invited to Tuesday’s screening. Their statements will be heard by the police investigators before they decide whether to proceed with the case. At the suggestion of President Jokowi, the police had previously announced that the case screening would be open to the public as a way of ensuring transparency in the investigation process. The police, however, backtracked on this announcement following strong criticism from legal experts. National Police spokesperson Insp. Gen. Boy Rafli Amar said on Monday that as representatives of the public, members of the House of Representatives Commission III overseeing legal affairs, the Indonesian Ombudsman and the National Police Commission (Komplonas) would be invited to the screening. “After the experts and reporting parties provide us with all the required information, we will need one or two days to decide whether we will go forward with the case or drop it,” Boy told reporters. Among the invited experts are representatives of Pemuda Muhammadiyah, the youth wing of Indonesia’s second-largest Islamic organization Muhammadiayh, the Antiblasphemy Forum (FAPA), the FPI and the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI). House Commission III chairman, Bambang Soesatyo, however, said the commission had turned down the invitation. “Commission III decided not to attend, in order to maintain the police’s independence as an institution,” the legislator announced on Monday. Ahok said that he would accept whatever result was reached by the police in their investigation even if it meant that he could be named a suspect in the case. “I believe the police are professional. Whatever the police decide, I will accept it, even if I am named a suspect,” Ahok said during an event at his campaign headquarters in Menteng, Central Jakarta, on Monday. The governor hoped that, if the police named him a suspect, they would present his case to the court immediately and wanted it to be aired live on television so people could see that he was not guilty.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/11/15/ahok-present-egyptian-expert-blasphemy-case.html,,2016
"Thu, November 17 2016",Suspect status not end of world for Ahok,"Bowing to pressure: National Police’s Criminal Investigation Department chief Comr. Gen. Ari Dono Sukmanto shows the suspect declaration document for non-active Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama in the blasphemy case at police headquarters in Jakarta on Wednesday.(JP/Wendra Ajistyatama) No somber tone nor desperation gripped supporters and volunteers of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama at their campaign headquarters in historic Rumah Lembang in the posh neighborhood of Menteng, Central Jakarta, as the police named Ahok a suspect in a blasphemy case on Wednesday. Ahok and his swath of supporters as well as political parties backing his candidacy for the upcoming gubernatorial election were undeterred by the suspect status. Ahok told reporters during a press briefing that becoming a suspect was not the end of the world for him and his political career. “This is not the end. This is just the beginning,” said Ahok, accompanied by his running mate, deputy governor Djarot Saiful Hidayat. “Let’s keep our spirits high, and let’s win the election in one round,” said Ahok to the cheers of his supporters. Ahok convinced his supporters that the suspect status would not in any way invalidate his candidacy, and he hoped more voters would turn up to lend support. The election will take place on Feb. 15. A court trial is unlikely to be held by then as the National Police will need to wrap up their investigation before it is submitted to the Attorney General’s Office (AGO) for further process. It may take years to reach a final, legally binding verdict. The four political parties supporting Ahok — the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), Golkar Party, NasDem Party and Hanura Party — have also conveyed their backing of Ahok’s candidacy. “The fantastic four will stay united to support Ahok. No dispute or doubt,” Golkar politician TB Ace Hadan Syadzily, who is a campaign team member, said in reference to the four parties. Golkar’s advisory board chairman Aburizal Bakrie previously demanded an evaluation regarding its support of Ahok — a maneuver quickly trashed by Golkar chairman Setya Novanto. Golkar politician Fayakhun Andriadi conveyed his belief that Ahok could still win the election despite his suspect status, as he believes in the “silent majority”. This group, he said, supported Ahok but remained quiet to avoid extra attention. “On top of that, Golkar members have been especially enthusiastic to unite and support Ahok,” Fayakhun said. He said there would likely be a change in campaign strategy, but he refused to give details. NasDem, which previously considered pulling its support if Ahok was named a suspect, has changed course. “Chairman Surya Paloh has instructed us not to step back and to continue giving our best effort to secure Ahok’s victory, although there will be some minor evaluations,” NasDem politician Wibi Andrino said. Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent in the predominantly Muslim country, sparked uproar among conservative Muslim groups in late September after he spoke to local residents and city officials in Thousand Islands about voting rights and cited Al-Maidah, verse 51 of the Quran. The verse has often been used by politicians to deter Muslim voters from electing non-Muslims. The outrage, exacerbated by free-riding politicians, such as former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono whose son is also a candidate in the Jakarta election, culminated in the Nov. 4 rally attended by over 100,000 people, mostly from outside Jakarta. The protesters have demanded the prosecution of Ahok for the alleged blasphemy and will stage a bigger protest on Nov. 25 if their demand is unheeded. Probably to prevent the planned rally from turning into another round of violence, the National Police named Ahok a suspect. “Because of differing opinions among police investigators, we have agreed that the case should be settled in an open trial,” the head of the National Police’s Criminal Investigation Department (Bareskrim), Comr. Gen. Ari Dono, said. Ari said the police had also barred Ahok from traveling overseas but would not detain him during the investigation as Ahok was participating in the election and there was no risk of him fleeing or hiding evidence. Ahok’s status as a suspect will not halt his participation in the election. According to Article 88 of the General Elections Commission (KPU) Regulation No. 9/2016, candidacy can only be revoked if a candidate is proven to have committed a crime and will serve more than five years in prison based on a legal verdict before the election. PDI-P senior politician and lawyer Trimedya Panjaitan said he was convinced that Ahok’s status would not influence his electability. “I don’t think it will impact Ahok because I am sure that Jakartans understand the legal process of this case,” he said. Besides, PDI-P would also examine the reasons behind the police’s decision to name Ahok a suspect because the party argued that the police had failed to provide substantial evidence against Ahok. “We’ll examine the police’s decision before determining what we should do next,” Trimedya said. In response to the status, Ahok’s contender Anies Baswedan said he hoped the law enforcement process would be conducted rightfully. “The police should keep their independence. So, we hope the steps taken by the police uphold just law enforcement,” he said. Anies refused to connect the legal case to the political situation in the gubernatorial election. “I want to campaign for Jakarta, which has nothing to do with the legal case,” he said. Other gubernatorial hopeful Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono said he hoped that all parties would respect the legal process of the case. “I hope Ahok will fare well in this situation,” he said while visiting Jangkrik Market in East Jakarta. ______________________________________ Buni Yani - JP/Wendra Ajistyatama Timeline of Ahok case * Sept. 21: Incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama officially registers his candidacy for the gubernatorial election in February with the Jakarta Elections Commission. * Sept. 27: Ahok speaks to local residents and city officials in Thousand Islands about voting rights.

"Fri, November 18 2016",Greater Jakarta: Man arrested for uploading ‘provocative’ clip,"The Jakarta Police have arrested a 52-year-old man from Bekasi, West Java, for allegedly uploading a clip containing a “false” statement by Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Mochamad Iriawan. The suspect, identified only by the initials MHS, was the owner of YouTube channel “Muslim Friends”, Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Awi Setiyono said on Thursday. “The suspect was arrested in Bekasi on Tuesday. He has been charged under the 2008 Electronic Information and Transactions [ITE] Law for transmitting video containing edited speech of the police chief that is slanderous and defaming,” he said as quoted by kompas.com. According to Awi, the footage, which was circulating online during the large rally in Jakarta on Nov. 4, provided false and misleading information to make it look like Iriawan had made a provocative statement. Last week, the Islamic Students Association (HMI) reported Iriawan to the National Police’s internal affairs division (Propam) based on the statement Iriawan was depicted to have made in the video, which they believed had provoked Islam Defenders Front (FPI) members to apprehend HMI members during the rally. Awi said the suspect had deliberately edited the video to incite hatred between the organizations and spark false public opinion about the police. “He also wrote a provocative title for the clip: ‘Revealed, Jakarta Police Chief provoked FPI to attack HMI members’,” Awi explained. Should he be proven guilty, MHS may face six years imprisonment or Rp 1 billion (US$75,000) in fines.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/11/18/greater-jakarta-man-arrested-uploading-provocative-clip.html,,2016
"Sat, November 19 2016",Govt moves to defuse tension,"Amid growing polarization among voters ahead of the simultaneous regional elections, the authorities have scrambled to ease the seemingly unabated tension stemming from an alleged blasphemy case. As President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has been occupied in the past couple of weeks convening with a number of political and religious bigwigs, the Indonesian Military (TNI) and the National Police have taken several soft-approach measures aimed at defusing the tension. Several conservative Muslim fringe groups have refused to lower the tension although the National Police declared Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja “Ahok” Purnama, a Christian of Chinese descent, a suspect in the blasphemy case on Wednesday. In anticipation of another round of rallies by conservative Muslims, who will also join forces with labor unions, not only in Jakarta but in other places in the archipelago next week or in early December, the TNI and the National Police held on Friday a joint massive prayer at the National Monument in Central Jakarta. Aimed at resonating peace and tolerance, around 20,000 personnel from all elements of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, as well as from the National Police, held a mass prayer under the theme “prayer for the safety of the nation”. A dozen habibs (religious leaders) participated in the event. The event was also participated in by thousands of orphans from orphanage foundations and members of pengajian (Islamic learning forum) groups across Jakarta, and family members of the security personnel. At the same time, five worship places in the capital — the Jakarta Cathedral, GPIB Immanuel Church, HKBP Cililitan, GKI Kwitang and Pura Mustika Dharma — also held similar mass prayers led by their respective religious leaders. National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian said amid the growing polarization among voters who support different candidates, it was important to remind people not to blend politics with religious, ethnic and racial issues, which had the potential to disturb a democratic election. “In Jakarta we have witnessed how the road to the gubernatorial election has involved such dynamics, and there has also been escalated tension that has caused security instability,” Tito said. Since a dozen of conservative Muslim groups reported Ahok to the police in October, accusing him of blasphemy, the movement to have him prosecuted has grown bigger, culminating in the violent Nov. 4 rally in front of the State Palace and triggering a minor riot in a Chinese residential area in North Jakarta. “Security forces will continue to ensure stability and security. However, human efforts won’t suffice if we don’t have God’s blessings,” said Tito. TNI Commander Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo said the Friday mass prayers served as a reminder that the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia could only be realized with the help of figures from different religious backgrounds who fought for the country’s independence. Shortly after the event, firebrand Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab confirmed that groups of anti-Ahok protesters would stage a third major rally against the governor on Dec. 2. The groups are under the so-called National Movement of Indonesian Ulema Council Edict Supporters (GNPF MUI). Rizieq, however, claimed that the demonstration would be “very peaceful” although the protesters would occupy the highway between the Semanggi intersection and the Presidential Palace. He said the rally would only include Friday Prayer, Quran readings, mass prayers, dzikir (chants), as well as shalawat (prayers to Prophet Muhammad). “Because Ahok still runs free, we have decided to stage another protest. Ahok should be jailed, it is the legal procedure. All suspects charged under Article 156 (a) of the Criminal Code in Indonesia’s history are always imprisoned,” FPI spokesman Munarman said. In opposition to such a movement, a coalition of civil society groups is set to hold a “Bhinneka Tunggal Ika Parade”, a theme derived from the country’s motto “unity in diversity”, in the capital on Saturday. Participants of the rally are expected to wear red-and-white clothes or Indonesia’s traditional clothes and are prohibited from representing any organization, company or political party. Coordinating Political, Legal, and Security Affairs Minister Wiranto has questioned the GNPF MUI’s plan to hold another demonstration, saying that since the authorities had already fulfilled their demand to process Ahok through a transparent and fair mechanism, they should just wait for the next legal process. Police chief Tito was suspicious that the demand to have Ahok imprisoned was politically motivated. “The due process is still ongoing. I suspect those demanding the imprisonment have a certain political agenda for the upcoming elections.” ______________________________ To receive comprehensive and earlieraccess to The Jakarta Post print edition, please subscribe to our epaperthrough iOS' iTunes, Android's Google Play, Blackberry World or Microsoft'sWindows Store.

"Tue, November 22 2016",Cops talk tough on Dec. 2 rally,"Show of force: National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian (left) briefs reporters as Indonesian Military (TNI) commander Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo looks on after their meeting at police headquarters in Jakarta on Monday. The meeting discussed security measures to deal with rallies slated for Dec. 2. The authorities have insisted that they will not permit next month’s planned large-scale rally in Jakarta because the demonstration, which was originally aimed at demanding the prosecution of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama for blasphemy, has been taken over by political elements aimed at destabilizing President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s administration. National Police Chief Gen. Tito Karnavian and Indonesian Military (TNI) commander Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo held a meeting on Monday to discuss the planned Dec. 2 rally. Tito said the police would not allow the demonstration, which was expected to consist of mass Friday prayers performed on Jl. Thamrin and Jl. Sudirman, as well as the Hotel Indonesia Traffic Circle, all in Central Jakarta, because “freedom of speech is never absolute.” Wider concern for the well-being of the public should be the priority, he said. “Based on the 1998 Freedom of Speech Law, [demonstrating] is the people’s constitutional right but it must not contravene other people’s rights or public order and must not close major streets,” said the former Jakarta police chief. If the protesters insist on staying in the area, or fighting with the police, the police will take stern measures against them, he added. He also threatened to charge the protesters with treason should they become violent or visibly attempt to undermine the government. Gatot, meanwhile, said the two forces had worked together to uncover the mastermind behind the planned rally. “Intelligence agencies from the police and the TNI have gathered information as to who has encouraged them to take part in the rally,” said Gatot, adding that the TNI were ready to take part in a “jihad” in defense of national unity. The two made the statement following a plan by Muslim organizations, grouped under the National Movement to Save Indonesian Ulema Council’s Edict (GNPF-MUI), to hold a massive rally on Dec. 2. They claim the protest is aimed at demanding the police detain incumbent gubernatorial candidate and blasphemy suspect Ahok. The organizations held a similar rally on Nov. 4, in which more than 100,000 people took part, to demand the police charge Ahok with blasphemy, which has since been done. They initially announced they would hold the next protest on Nov. 25. Tito said the police had received information that there could still be demonstrations on Nov. 25, especially at the House of Representatives. Firebrand Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab has claimed that the demonstration would be “very peaceful” since it would only comprise Friday prayers, Quran readings, mass prayers, dzikir (chants), as well as shalawat (prayers to the Prophet Muhammad), even though they would occupy the highway from the Semanggi intersection to the State Palace. Regardless, Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. M. Iriawan said full-scale security measures were in place to ensure security in the capital. Separately, Religious Affairs Minister Lukman Hakim Saifuddin also questioned the plan to hold another rally, especially since the police had named Ahok a suspect. “But if [another rally] is deemed necessary, it should be held in accordance with the law,” Lukman said. In response, Islamic People’s Forum (FUI) secretary-general Muhammad Al-Khaththath accused the authorities of committing a crime if they prohibited the rally. “[Demonstrating] is guaranteed by the law,” he said. FPI spokesman Munarman, meanwhile, denied any political motivation behind the planned rally. “Through this [demonstration] we actually want to deliver prayers so that Indonesia will be saved from ‘actors’ who want to divide the nation,” he said. Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence (Kontras) civil and political rights division head Putri Kanesia said the authorities should protect people’s freedom of expression. “Authorities can carry out actions against [the protesters] if they violate the law, however, the enforcement should still be conducted in a persuasive way,” Putri said.

"Thu, November 24 2016",Jokowi shrugs off threat of instability,"With the security forces ready to deal with more rallies by conservative Muslims demanding the arrest of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo appeared to be at ease on Wednesday, calling such protests as the noise of democracy. In a meeting with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte at the State Palace, Jokowi said it was only natural for democracy to “get a little noisy sometimes”. “You may have heard we had some demonstrations and some political tensions recently. We have this kind of political outburst from time to time. We are becoming used to it. We gladly accept it as a price of democracy,” Jokowi said. Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab announced on Wednesday that the FPI along with other conservative Muslim groups, united in the National Movement to Safeguard the Indonesian Ulema Council’s Fatwa (GNPF-MUI), would go ahead with its rally plans on Dec. 2 to demand the government arrest Ahok for alleged blasphemy. Ahok, who is seeking reelection in February, inadvertently provoked Muslims when he cited a verse from the Quran during a gathering with residents in Thousand Islands, Jakarta. The protests did not stop even after the National Police began to question Ahok as a suspect in the case. Ahead of the anticipated rally, the President publicly met several influential figures, putting on display the stable support of his government. Last week, Jokowi met with Gerindra Party chairman Prabowo Subianto, signaling the possibility of new terms between the former rivals who competed against each other in the 2014 presidential election. On Monday, he met with former president and Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle chairwoman Megawati Soekarnoputri and later United Development Party (PPP)chairman Romahurmuziy, on Tuesday, to discuss various political issues. The heightened communications with the political and Muslim leaders have resulted in solid support behind the government. Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama, the country’s two largest Muslim organizations, have denounced the rallies and called on Muslims to refrain from participating in them. The GNPF-MUI was behind an earlier mass rally on Nov. 4, which later turned violent. Muhammadiyah chairman Haedar Nashir later called on all Muslims on Wednesday to accept the decision of the police who have named Ahok a suspect in the blasphemy case. “We strongly support the law enforcement authorities in upholding justice against those who have done wrong,” Haedar said as quoted by Antara news agency. Security forces have been on high alert ahead of any planned rallies. The Jakarta Police have taken a tougher stance, having issued a circular to remind people that an act of treason could result in the death penalty. “In expressing one’s thought in public, it is illegal to carry out [an act that will jeopardize] the nation’s security such as treason against the President or the Vice President,” the circular stated, which was signed by Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Mochammad Iriawan. In a move to ensure that everyone is aware of the law, the police plan to drop around 50,000 copies of the circulars from a helicopter. The police have also named Buni Yani, who posted a video of Ahok addressing Thousands Islands residents, a suspect, accusing him of inciting public anger against the governor. The Jakarta Legal Aid Institute (LBH Jakarta) has cautioned against the police’s stern action, saying it could disrupt the process of democracy. “Police intelligence must be proactive, but not to the point where it could restrict the space for democracy. This incident risks becoming a precedent in future expressions of opinion,” LBH Jakarta director Alghiffari Aqsa told The Jakarta Post. Beyond the capital, pressure and insults from conservative Muslim groups allegedly wishing to topple Jokowi have sparked public anger in a number of regions supporting the President in Central Java, especially in Banyumas regency. Members of the community expressed a readiness to fight to protect Jokowi if the groups continued with their threats. They have erected dozens of banners thorughout Banyumas capital of Purwokerto.

"Mon, November 28 2016",From Trump to Indonesian political Islam,"When the populist Donald Trump won the United States presidency, as populism is on the rise globally, people began to wonder what impact it could have elsewhere in terms of such spirit. Does it suddenly become relevant for Europe, as well as for Indonesian Islamic populists who have recently held mass rallies in attempts to threaten the state? Some analysts have pointed out that Trump has exploited white supremacy and successfully championed frustrated working class sentiments vis-à-vis elitist-interventionist liberals. In the same vein, the nationalist-xenophobic part of the establishment and the disappointed working class in the United Kingdom voted in favor of Brexit (the UK’s exit from the European Union) last June. Open populism is a sign of upcoming spirit representing latent undercurrents, which manifest in certain times. It denotes forces and rhetoric instantly appealing to popular instincts and sentiments, including primordial identities, in particular to those population segments in disadvantageous social lives, without better access to the industrial structure and state institutions. With them being ignored or humiliated, populist demagogue calls for new morals could arouse rising self-identity, nationalist pride and upward mobility expectations. In short, Trump’s victory may be a wake-up call for populist dreams in Europe. For Indonesia, however, the dream has a distinct background. The great popularity of the Christian governor of Jakarta, Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, who is an Indonesian of Chinese descent, closely associated with some corporations and supported by the middle classes, has worried populist Islamists. His simple statement mentioning a Quranic verse has been maliciously misconstrued to provoke massive emotions and set off allegations of blasphemy to prevent him from taking part in the gubernatorial elections. What is significant, though, is this has led the political Islamic establishment — the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) — to support the mass protest rallies initiated by a small vigilante group, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), led by Rizieq Shihab. Many immediately suspected the hands of former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and retired general Prabowo Subianto, who had been politically close to some Islamic groupings in the past and now supported Ahok’s competitors. President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo responded as never before by demonstrating his authority as supreme commander, posing with the police, the marines and the Army special corps and ordering them to maintain the unity of the nation. The root of the matter, however, goes back, partly, to the early days of the republic. Shortly after the Nov. 4 rally, Munarman, a former human rights lawyer-turned FPI leader, claimed Indonesian Islam had too often been betrayed since the Jakarta Charter, in which the state mandated the Muslim requirement to practice Sharia “was deleted [from the Constitution] on Aug. 18, 1945”. In his view, typically, it was “the secular forces” that time that again had cheated Islam and Indonesia’s Muslim majority despite “its key role in 1945 [the struggle for independence], 1965 [destroying the communists] and 1998 [the fall of Soeharto]”. One member of an Islamist party recently complained, “Throughout the New Order and after, we have always been a minority of second-class citizens, haven’t we?” With such rhetoric, they called on the masses to be ready for syuhada (martyrdom) in future rallies. Munarman’s splendid demagogy reminds us of political Islam with its subjectively painful position as a minority with, theoretically speaking, majority aspirations, yet continually unable to satisfy them. He likened Indonesia metaphorically to a car with secular forces being the driver and Islam merely “pushing the car”. Indeed, the Dutch sociologist WF Wertheim once called Indonesian Islam “a majority with minority mentality” ( 1959 ). Today we should perhaps mark them as a minority with a false consciousness of false majority aspiration — a delusion — since only a real majority with the same ideology could possibly achieve Sharia objectives. Now, however, the conservative MUI, whose leaders include influential figures of the two biggest Islamic mass organizations, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah, have joined the vigilante group to shape a greater configuration of groups with the dream of being a majority. This should not be taken lightly. It may be a greater driving force to challenge the government. Whatever Trump’s effect globally and on Indonesia (if any), Jokowi has to maneuver even more cautiously toward both general political Islam and the military. New rightwing populism, because it is generally non-violent, is sometimes called “fascism with a human face”. Once the rising populist gambit of identity politics proves to work broadly and profoundly, it should put all sides into a new agenda. Jokowi has already approached representatives of the MUI and the two biggest Islamic mass organizations, as well as 17 other Islamic groupings. Earlier, in a Cabinet reshuffle, he tactfully removed his closest adviser, the Christian retired general Luhut Pandjaitan, from his key position as political Tsar. Given the new political constellation that is taking place, the President might be tempted to give more, rather than less, space to the military, and less and less to concede to the growing strength of political Islam. Either way, it is a threat to shrinking pluralist and democratic values. _____________________________ The writer is an independent journalist.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/11/28/from-trump-indonesian-political-islam.html,,2016
"Wed, November 30 2016",COMMENTARY: Dec. 2 rally: Should we worry?,"It is without doubt that the race to secure the top job in the Jakarta administration has drained much of the public’s energy, as well as engulfed many with the unabated fear of political and security instability. Although the violence stemming from the Nov. 4 rally was swiftly contained, the protest apparently served as a springboard for disgruntled elements to turn up the pressure. Their demand at the time was for incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian of Chinese descent, to be declared a blasphemy suspect. Probably out of fear of escalating tension, the police acquiesced to their demand on Nov. 16 But still the National Movement to Safeguard the Indonesia Ulema Council’s Fatwa (GNPF-MUI), which initiated the Nov. 4 rally attended by more than 100,000 Muslim organization members, has not backed down. It has instead promised a bigger protest on Dec. 2, demanding Ahok’s imprisonment at a time when Ahok should be on the campaign trail. Judging by the group’s aim, as amplified by one of its leaders, Rizieq Shihab of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), it is hard not to conclude that a sinister motive is at play. It is not implausible that President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian may be correct in suspecting that the upcoming rally is politically motivated, similar to the Nov. 4 rally when Jokowi blamed “political actors” for inciting violence and Tito indicated that certain elements used the rally as a precursor to topple the legitimate government. Perhaps the substantial efforts by the President, as well as by the chiefs of the Indonesia Military (TNI) and the police, to contain the impact of the previous rally and to limit the significance of the upcoming one have raised questions over the possibility of a coup attempt and whether the President is actually in full control to keep any harm at bay. Speculation over a coup attempt are not only baseless but also a far-fetched assumption. First, since Indonesia’s independence in 1945, plotting a coup has not been a tradition, having occurred only once in 1965 when then president Sukarno handed over the presidency to Soeharto. Second, there are no strong figures within the TNI capable of uniting the highly fragmented armed forces to lead a coup. Third, negative sentiment against military rule runs deep within the police force, an institution that probably now has the most personnel and the best intelligence infrastructure. Fourth, there is not the slightest indication that Jokowi has committed severe violations, such as corruption, murder or adultery. And fifth, not only does Jokowi’s popularity remain high, he also enjoys overwhelming legislative support as his coalition controls more than 65 percent of the seats in the House of Representatives. The Nov. 4 rally and the upcoming one merely serve as pressure by several politicians (including from political parties in Jokowi’s ruling coalition), state officials, public figures, religious luminaries and activists who have been starved of resources since Jokowi took office in late 2014. These people have acted with precise timing and may have forged a union with political elites who are facing difficulties in trying to defeat Ahok merely through programs in the upcoming gubernatorial election. The escalating racial and religious slurs in the past couple of weeks have apparently undermined Ahok, as indicated by recent surveys suggesting a sharp decline in his electability. It is the blending of the “hungry” elements and the regional election elites, who may have resorted to any means necessary to win, that have created fear of political instability over the past couple of weeks. Since the 1998 Reform Era that saw the resignation of president Soeharto, political and security interference to undermine a legitimate government is not without precedent. In his biography published before his term expired in 2014, then president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono mentioned the many attempts to topple his government. But what differentiates the past with events of today is the infusion of racial and religious provocation. Even Yudhoyono has been accused of toying with such sentiments by using issues related to Ahok to his advantage. Yudhoyono’s son, Agus Harimurti, is competing with Ahok in the Jakarta gubernatorial election, and Yudhoyono has publicly insisted the prosecution against Ahok in a tone that contained more than a hint of provocation. For Jokowi, it is not a coup attempt that worries him most; it is the racial and religious issues, referred to locally as SARA (ethnicity, religion, race and class), that perhaps send shivers down his spine. The Dec. 2 rally is feared by many to be a precursor to violence that may spiral into widespread conflict. The violent Nov. 4 rally in front of the Presidential Palace triggered a minor riot in a Chinese residential area in North Jakarta and opened old wounds from the traumatic 1998 riots that saw heavy casualties among the Chinese-Indonesian community. Home to more 1,300 tribes that practice six different religions and speak 740 different languages but are unified under one language, Indonesia is demographically prone to SARA conflicts. However, the authorities have swiftly moved to reduce the potential for conflict by diminishing the significance of the rally from the very top. Not only will the authorities prohibit protesters from out of town to enter Jakarta to participate in the upcoming rally, officers have also visited leaders of many boarding schools and discouraged them from allowing their students to participate in the rally. Campaigns to promote unity have resonated not only in Jakarta but also across the archipelago as local military and police chiefs have held numerous interfaith functions attended by prominent religious leaders from several different religions. A number of people who were at the forefront in demanding that Ahok be prosecuted are now also facing legal charges for SARA-related incitement. Police chief Tito has issued a stern warning to clerics grouped in the Indonesia Ulema Council (MUI), demanding that they not mix religion with politics as it could cause sectarian conflict. The MUI, whose leader Ma’aruf Amin is an ally of Yudhoyono, has soften its stance on participating in the rally. The MUI and FPI struck a deal with Tito on Monday that the Friday protest would be conducted wholly within the confines of the National Monument (Monas) Park. Stern action will be taken if the MUI, the FPI and the GNPF-MUI violate the agreement. With the authorities now better prepared and having learned a lesson from the previous rally, any negative impact of the upcoming rally is likely to be minimal. Indonesia’s politics will remain heated, as Jokowi recently said, up until the simultaneous regional elections on Feb. 15. Indonesia has seen its worst, and if history is any indication, the upcoming rally may well be just another hiccup in the country’s democracy.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/11/30/commentary-dec-2-rally-should-we-worry.html,,2016
"Wed, November 30 2016","Politicization of religion: Believe, but don’t fight about it!","What would really infuriate the Prophet Muhammad? The use of Islam to justify incitement to anger, bigotry, intolerance and destruction by groups of narrow (political) interests. The most recent examples in Indonesia are the actions by conservative Islamic groups protesting blasphemy allegedly committed by Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama (see “Hotdogs, blasphemy, bigotry, Jakarta elections and Ahok”, The Jakarta Post , Nov. 2). Despite Ahok apologizing and the fact he is currently facing trial, more than 100,000 people participated in a rally held on Nov. 4. A sea of people — many members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) — clad in white Arab-style dress flooded main streets like Jl. Thamrin around the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle. Many came from outside Jakarta. The Nov. 4 rally was the biggest demonstration since 1998, which at that time erupted into days of horrendous violence, looting, rape and killing. No wonder Jakartans were worried about the rally, especially since many were shouting “Arrest Ahok!” and even “Kill Ahok!” There really was no point to the demonstration on Nov. 4, and yet there is going to be another anti-Ahok rally on Dec. 2. Many citizens have risen to Ahok’s defense by pointing out his achievements in relation to dealing with Jakarta’s intractable problems: flooding, garbage, pollution, traffic, infrastructure, the high price of basic commodities, cost of education and health, reduction of corruption etc. What about Ahok’s stance on Islam? A YouTube pictorial cartoon video posted on Nov. 5 presents data on the number of mosques he has funded, spending billions of rupiah to build new mosques and repair existing ones. Just google “Data Ahok” on YouTube. Not exactly the picture of someone who hates Islam. Indikator, a think tank on democracy issues, conducted a survey of the achievements of the incumbent governor of Jakarta (yes, Ahok) and the effect of SARA (suku, ras, agama — ethnic, racial and religious) prejudice in the 2016 Jakarta gubernatorial elections. The conclusion: while Ahok’s approval rating was high (about 70 percent) it did not necessarily correspond to Ahok’s electability. So, it turns out that Jakartans — indeed Indonesians in general — are schizophrenic, split between their rational minds and their hearts, which are filled with deeply ingrained anti-Chinese, anti-Christian sentiments. This is really great news for Indonesia — not! This points to a longstanding problem: Indonesia is conflicted on the politics of religion. It forces everyone to have one, and yet does not want conflict among them. We all know religion gives meaning, inspiration and guidance in billions of people’s lives. Yet it’s also a source of conflict, violence and instability. If something like religion is proven to be a dangerous issue for a community (i.e. Indonesia), then surely it is important to have boundaries in place that uphold freedom but prevent conflict. The first and most urgent step is to take very strict measures to forbid the politicization of religion. A petition was launched by Change.org precisely on this issue. In it is a photo of Habib Rizieq Syihab, head of the notorious FPI, which quotes him as saying, “It is haram [forbidden] for infidels to be governors of Muslim-majority areas. This is dictated by a Holy Verse and is non-negotiable. And the Holy Verse is higher than the Constitution.” Why is Habib Rizieq not arrested for so blatantly insulting the state? And why is the FPI not banned for also blatantly inciting SARA? Indonesia was known as a moderate Muslim country. Ironically, intolerance arose under then president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY). The FPI, which some people describe as the attack dog of the police and the military, increased in influence during his watch. When President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo made oblique references to a political actor behind the rallies, it was because he allegedly received intelligence reports that SBY may have had a role in the big demo. It doesn’t take a genius to connect the political dots — knock Ahok out of the way, get his son Agus in as governor, which is now viewed as a stepping stone to the presidency. The old dynasty strategy! Faced with these accusations, SBY screamed “fitnah!” (slander), held a somewhat nervous press conference at his residence in Cikeas, repeatedly mopping his brow, then seemed to disappear for three weeks. He reemerged on Nov. 28 by producing a long (and boring) open letter to Jokowi, basically denying he had anything to do with the rallies. If there are rumors that point to Ahok being used as a means to destabilize Jokowi, they could well be true. In fact some people believe that Jokowi is in danger of being overthrown. Otherwise why would he go to Prabowo, his erstwhile opponent, for support? Well, because Prabowo who is more comfortable among Merah-Putih nationalists, has had to ally himself with the conservative Islamic Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) and unpleasant people like singer Ahmad Dhani (who now has political ambitions to become mayor of Bekasi) because he has no other allies. And we know there is no love-loss between SBY and Prabowo as well. The plot thickens in multiple direction. Politics make strange bedfellows? Damned right it does! Prabowo must have had fun though, making Jokowi perch on a horse in a cowboy hat when the latter came to his Hambalang house and ranch. But Jokowi was probably thinking, a small price to pay to freeze SBY out. And Prabowo wasn’t the only guy Jokowi was begging for help from. He also approached various military and police commanders and heads of moderate Islamic organizations like Nahdlatul Ulama (NU). Jokowi’s advantage is a comfortable majority in the House of Representatives and constitutional limits on the procedures for removing a president. The problem is once the evil genie of Islamic extremism is out of the bottle, it is very difficult to force it to get back in. So what to do with the politicization of religion? Basically, Indonesia needs to put safeguards in place to make sure Islam is protected as a religion but not abused as a political instrument in the ongoing political battles by short-sighted political figures. These people are endangering the nation. It is not anti-Islamic to insist that Islam not be politicized and used to whip up anger, conflict and destabilizing violence. So, all reasonable Muslims out there should refrain from getting swept up in headlines and emotions, but demand instead that questions surrounding Ahok and religion in general be handled via established institutions and procedures. We as Indonesians need to align our heads with our hearts and heal our schizophrenia! ____________________________________ The writer is the author of Julia’s Jihad.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/11/30/politicization-religion-believe-don-t-fight-about-it.html,,2016
"Fri, December 2 2016",National scene: Group denounces violence against journalist,"The Association of Journalists for Diversity (Sejuk) has denounced the alleged violence committed against tirto.id journalist Reja Hidayat by a member of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). In a statement made available on Thursday, the association said it received a report that Reja had been hit and told to leave by an FPI member on Wednesday at 2:15 p.m. when he was in Petamburan, Central Jakarta, near FPI headquarters. In the chronology outlined by Reja, the journalist wrote in his report circulating in several journalists’ chat groups that the perpetrator tried to prohibit him from reporting on an FPI meeting ahead of a planned rally and demanded he delete everything he had already written. Allegedly, he also said he did not trust the media. The association said the alleged assault violated press freedom guaranteed to members of the media in the 1999 Press Law. Two other journalists, one from Gatra magazine and another from the Jawa Pos News Network, were also forced away and told they were not allowed to write news about the preparations for a Dec. 2 rally, which is being undertaken by, among others, the FPI, the association also claimed. During a previous rally on Nov. 4, journalists from Metro TV, Kompas TV and Berita Satu, reportedly received threats.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/12/02/national-scene-group-denounces-violence-against-journalist.html,,2016
"Fri, December 2 2016",Is Jokowi’s political tour enough to ensure stability?,"Before and after the Nov. 4 protest against Jakarta Governor Basuki  “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama over alleged blasphemy, and ahead of the Dec. 2 rally, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has met political leaders and representatives of state instutions to make sure political stability remains intact. Nov. 4 was clearly about contentious politics, since it occurred in public and involved claims collectively made in a rather ad hoc fashion. In that way it differed from normal politics emerging from institutional settings that involve procedures, norms and regulations. Contentious politics is when you have people making collective claims using tools like demonstrations. This is pretty normal in a more open political system, in which individuals have the freedom to articulate their opinion. However, with regard to democracy, contentious politics can turn into a double-edged sword. Contentious political activities may indicate that a polity is democratic, but they can also open space for movements that threaten the system, especially in a new democracy like Indonesia. There are two consistently important aspects to contention: identity formation and polarization. This is because in a case of contention, each side will try to draw the once moderate voices to their side, to their extreme one. When it comes to identity formation, sometimes paying attention solely to the “whodunnit” element is not enough. We also have to ask, what the discourse itself does. I personally believe the chance of a coup remains relatively low, even if the contention escalates. However, I am worried that the Nov. 4 rally shows that we are too divided, not in a way where there are two extremes ridiculing each other, but in a way that one voice is actually getting louder while the other is lost for words in trying to mobilize the masses. It is because there are two logics involved in the contention we saw most recently. On the surface, there are collective efforts of making claims by some predictable networks and groups. Beneath these apparent efforts are opinions expressed in social media, where competing mindsets duel in quite irreconcilable ways. This is the level where the contention gets personal, where people continuously try to make the issue more personal and copy banal templates to add effect to what is being discussed at the surface. Since social media can reduce the costs of communication, long established traditional networks can actually benefit from this personalized logic in what Bennett and Seberger ( 2012 ) called “connective action”. This logic can potentially escalate contention to become a threat to our democracy, even our nationhood. Such threat is likely, due to both the structural and discursive setting of politics today. At the structural level, there is an inherent flaw in our political system, where political articulation is not processed like in more liberal settings. Dan Slater, a political scientists of the University of Chicago, has discovered an “accountability trap” (Slater, 2004) in Indonesian politics, where elites are quite disconnected from the masses. They are not horizontally differentiated in terms of political platforms. Meanwhile, accountability works only in a horizontal way among the elites. Jokowi’s recent political tour, if we assume the game is still contentious politics without connective actions, is actually the best move. It helps consolidate the regime and minimize the risk of disruption. _________________________ The fact that hardline groups such as the FPI are moving to the center and starting to become normal stakeholders is pretty problematic. However, with such an accountability trap, our system is always prone to the emergence of new communal leaders who can publicly propose to reconnect society with politics. Social media increases this possibility, especially where we can reasonably doubt that political elites maintain a strong grip on their constituents. The pessimistic list is beginning to complete. No real policy issues have followed the campaign period in Jakarta, most likely due to hot debates over religion and ethnicity. New populist outsiders probably have not become prominent yet, but the fact that hardline groups such as the FPI are moving to the center and starting to become normal stakeholders is pretty problematic. This is exactly when we see that a notorious group like the FPI can utilize an issue to gain public support. When their cause overlaps with the increasingly conservative Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), the magnitude of silencing voices is worrying. Furthermore, we also cannot deny that, whatever the outcome of the blasphemy trial of Ahok will be, there are other issues where the public cannot find proper words to distance themselves from growing conservatism, for example the increasing criminalization of LGBT groups. The more serious problem lies at the narrative level. It is not only what is being said at the elite level, but also in everyday conversations. We talk about the urgency to reassert pluralist values, but we cannot even find substance, because even teachers cannot instill a sense of pluralism in their students other than suggesting to benignly neglect differences among religious groups in Indonesia. Elites, therefore, must seek to disrupt connections made by growing conservatism in this country, especially by those who continuously reappropriate our nationhood with their own twist. We surely had a heartwarming picture circulated in social media when candidates for the Jakarta election took a wefie after their medical test. But today we don’t find anything more than memes, URL links and copy-pasted texts in WhatsApp to help us understand that our pluralism cannot be taken for granted. Diversity should not be solely guarded by a rigid implementation of regulations, when our interaction is 24-hour facilitated by connections through the internet. Political connections like those made by Jokowi are a necessary strategy to ensure political stability, but unfortunately they are not sufficient to tackle our nationhood problem. ______________________________________ The writer is a researcher in the department of politics and international relations at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Jakarta.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/12/02/is-jokowi-s-political-tour-enough-ensure-stability.html,,2016
"Sat, December 3 2016",Rising hostility toward journalists rings alarm,"Hostility toward journalists is alarmingly on the rise as Muslim conservatives have accused several media outlets of biased reporting in the blasphemy case of the incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama. The third-largest anti-Ahok demonstration on Friday in Central Jakarta, where more than 500,000 peopled flocked to the National Monument (Monas) complex in what they called a “peaceful rally”, saw another series of intimidations carried out by dozens of protesters against television crews reporting live. Early in the morning, protesters walking down Jl. Merdeka Selatan shouted in front of Kompas TV’s satellite news-gathering van, demanding the crews to stop reporting and to leave the scene. The protesters accused the TV stations of one-sided reporting that tended to be pro-Ahok. The situation, however, was quickly contained when police personnel approached and asked the crews to park their vans at City Hall. “This incident is unfortunate, because the protesters had promised to stage the rally in a peaceful manner. However, we appreciate the security officials’ quick action to guard us,” Kompas TV field producer Alvi Apriayandi said. Rifai Pamone, a Metro TV journalist who reported live from behind a wire barricade on Jl. Merdeka Barat, was also shouted at and hit with mineral water cups by protesters who claimed that the media he represented was a “provocateur”. Police personnel on standby behind the barricade asked Rifai to pause the recording of his reportage to defuse tensions. “When people already have negative sentiments, anything we do is wrong. We only get mineral water cups thrown at us, but that’s OK, we are only carrying out our journalistic duties,” Rifai said. The Legal Aid Institute for the Press (LBH Pers) noted that over the years, the number of cases of violence or other forms of abuses against journalists have fluctuated. However, numbers tend to rise significantly when nearing huge occasions, such as regional elections. “In numerous cases, the intimidations are carried out against journalists by the supporters of certain candidates [running in the election]”, LBH Pers research and networking head Asep Komaruddin told The Jakarta Post. LBH Pers is aware of the phenomena of labeling media outlets accused of biased reporting. “Labeling actually threatens the journalists as they are susceptible to becoming the targets of violence,” Asep said. In the previous Nov. 4 mass rally, which was also initiated by the National Movement to Safeguard the Indonesian Ulema Council’s Fatwa (GNPF-MUI), the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) recorded numerous instances of violence against journalists initiated by protesters. The violence included both physical and non-physical, such as when a TV crew was forced to leave Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta on allegations of biased reporting. In another case, Kompas TV journalist Muhammad Guntur was also intimidated and got his memory card taken away by protesters near the State Palace in Central Jakarta during the Nov. 4 rally, which erupted into violence after dusk. On Wednesday, journalist Reja Hidayat from tirto.id was hit and told to go away by an alleged member of the firebrand Islam Defenders Front (FPI) when he was carrying out work in Petamburan, Central Jakarta, near the FPI headquarters on Wednesday. Reja wrote in his report circulating in several journalist chat groups that the man tried to prohibit him from writing any news about the FPI meeting ahead of the rally and demanded that he delete anything he had already written. “We have filed a report with AJI. But we haven’t decided whether we will file a report with the police. But my office will send a protest letter to the FPI,” Reja told the Post. The AJI Jakarta chapter chairman Ahmad Nurhasim criticized the series of intimidations faced by journalists. “Intimidating actions, let alone violent attacks [against journalists] should not occur no matter the reason,” Ahmad told the Post, adding that the AJI would speak out against attacks that threatened press freedom. Ahmad said there were many ways people could voice their complaints against media outlets they claimed to be bias in their reporting that did not involve violence ,including by writing a letter to the editorial team or filing a report with the Press Council, as in accordance with the 1999 Press Law. However, Ahmad asserted that journalists should carry out their tasks based on the journalistic code of ethics. “Every mass media has a right to determine the angle of their reportage, however they should serve justice for all elements in society,” Ahmad said.

"Thu, December 15 2016",Where were the women in 212 protest?,"A lot has been said about the Dec. 2 protest by those who supported and were against it. The proponents of the protest have argued that the action was purely motivated by religious sensibilities and not about the religion or ethnicity of non-active Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, although back in 2014, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) — one of the initiators of the National Movement to Safeguard the Indonesian Ulema Council’s Fatwa (GNPF-MUI) — had already rejected Ahok on the basis of his religion and ethnicity. On the contrary, those who are against the 212 protest claim that the action was no more than political exploitation of religious symbols. Two worrying trends about all this narrative and counter-narrative are, first, just how easy it is for the Indonesian Muslim communities to fall into the trap of using a massive number of supporters for protests and taking it as a claim of the righteousness of their action, and second, the absence of the voice of Muslim women during both the protests and within the myriad commentaries and counter-commentaries written about the protest. It seems like the largest Muslim protest in Indonesia has forgotten to include half of the ummah, the Muslim women. Already I can hear the cliché counter-arguments that proponents of the protest might have against my opinion. “A lot of women, with their kids and family, were marching with us in the 212 protest,” or “You are just criticizing us from far away, you weren’t in the field and didn’t see for yourself how the women marched with us.” It’s true that women marched to the National Monument (Monas) on Dec. 2 and I was not there to see them in person. But one does not need to be in the field to see that the presence of most women in the protest was to affirm the patriarchal politico-religious narrative at best, and to serve as child caretakers at worst. The protest structurally and systematically rejected the presence of Muslim women within its circle of narrative. Structurally speaking, the protest was centered on the Friday prayer, a specific kind of public worship in which Muslim women not only in Indonesia but also around the world are discouraged from attending. This was proven when the prayer was about to start and the women were asked to move and give up their places for the men because the Friday prayer was supposed to be only about male Muslims and their “Islamic masculinity”. In addition, when one looks at it from the historical perspective, the Friday prayer also functioned as political and military mobilization in medieval Islam, with no room whatsoever for the existence of Muslim women. Systematically speaking, the protest was organized by the GNPF-MUI, which is dominated by vigilante groups. That being said, the logic of these vigilante groups is in full operation within the GNPF-MUI. Narratives that the 212 protest was a form of “jihad”, that respect needs to be paid to the Muslim leaders and habib (and not to the mothers who dealt with their kids during the march under the scorching sun and — afterwards — the rain of Jakarta), and that the Muslim males who attended the protest deserved to be praised due to their peaceful conduct (despite the fact that peaceful conduct is a responsibility, not an option, for every protester around the world), were built upon the false claim that, since it is natural for the Muslim guys to be violent, the peaceful 212 protest must be a spiritual miracle that showed God’s agreement with the systematic violence that the majority Muslims in Indonesia have imposed upon the country’s religious minorities. On top of all of that, the most unfortunate misogynistic element that occurred during the protest was shown in several sexual assaults against women who happened to be in the proximity of the protest site and who were deemed to be not wearing “Islamic clothing” by some male protesters. Though, seeing the narratives centered on the protest, one would not be surprised that sexual assaults were in order. Here is the largest gathering of “mujahids” who came to prove their loyalty to their religion by banishing a minority governor. They came to prove that they are the guardians of fragile Islam. The whole depiction of the protest was centered on the number of protestors and muscular expression of jihad. Each and every sense of masculinity in the protest was buttressed by the legitimacy of the ulema and the sense of divine justification to the supremacy of men over women. The women in “non-Islamic” clothing, who were victims of the sexual assaults, were seen as toxic appearances within the holier-than-thou protest to defend the Quran, and thus they needed to be “punished” by sexist and misogynistic slurs. More than that, these women were also there to be “offerings” for these mujahids. They were there as sexual objects because, after all of the shouting and marching in defense of Islam, these mujahids felt that they deserved instant sexual gratification in the form of women in short skirts and tight clothing. Post-212 protest, it is very unfortunate that there are people who even think that the FPI vigilante group might be able to lead Indonesian Muslim communities to glory (whatever that means). But even if this is true, it is proven that conservative Indonesian Muslims are far from ready to share the stage with Muslim women and that any Islamic movement that alienates the presence of women within its midst is doomed to fail. _____________________________ The writer is pursuing a PhD degree in theology at the University of Notre Dame, the US.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/12/15/where-were-women-212-protest.html,,2016
"Mon, December 19 2016",Police back hard-liners clamping down on Christmas,"A fatwa issued by the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) banning Muslims from donning paraphernalia related to other faiths has inspired the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) to take the law into its own hands and push shopping centers in Surabaya, East Java, to not ask its Muslim workers to wear Christmas-related gear. Instead of stopping the FPI’s actions, police moved to secure the group’s visit to seven shopping centers on Sunday, arguing that their presence would prevent clashes between the group and shopping center managements. The management of Toeng Market had no choice but to comply after around 50 FPI members, escorted by the police, paid a visit. “We will deliver the demands to our superiors. We did not know about the fatwa. We will comply with it,” said Toeng Market operational division head Wahyu Kuncoro after FPI members thronged his office. The MUI has issued similar calls ahead of Christmas, but not until this year has the FPI followed up by protesting at shopping centers. An FPI leader in East Java, Ali Fahmi, said Toeng Market management had agreed to sign an agreement as a guarantee that it would comply with the MUI edict. “They already signed the agreement on a stamp,” Ali said. Surabaya Police chief Sr. Comr. M. Iqbal said police escorted FPI members as they visited seven shopping centers in Surabaya to prevent clashes. “The FPI members disseminated information about the edict. We guarded the process to ensure public safety,” Iqbal said. Police deployed hundreds of personnel to “guard” the FPI’s shopping center visits. The visits took place two days after members of an FPI branch in Bekasi, West Java, thronged a Honda dealership in the region after it was rumored that Muslims employees, including female staffers wearing hijab, had been forced to wear Santa hats. Bekasi Police chief Sr. Comr. Umar Fana said police, together with several Islamic organizations, had met with the dealership’s management on Wednesday morning to discuss the matter. Islamic organization Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), which has around 60 million members across the country, lambasted the FPI for acting like a law enforcement agency. “The state must be present in this case to not let any mass organization exercise its own law on the streets. The Religious Affairs Ministry is taking this incident seriously. The ministry will not give room for radicalism to grow in Indonesia. The MUI has the duty to disseminate information about the edict, not a mass organization,” NU deputy secretary-general Imam Putudu said. Rights watchdog Setara Institute, which campaigns for pluralism, said an MUI fatwa was not a legal and binding ruling that must be followed by shopping centers, adding that police should have prevented the FPI in the first place and not facilitated them in carrying out such intimidation on department store management. “Such groups have grown confident following the mass rallies in Jakarta. The National Police should not support edicts that threaten religious diversity,” Setara researcher Ismail Hasani said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/12/19/police-back-hard-liners-clamping-down-christmas.html,,2016
"Tue, December 20 2016",Police told to resist undue influence of MUI,"Following the decision of some local police leaders to back a campaign by firebrand Muslim groups to crack down on Christmas celebrations, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has instructed National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian to uphold discipline among members of the force and make efforts to prevent their power from being abused by hardline groups. During a meeting with Tito at the State Palace on Monday, Jokowi said that the police force must work only to implement official rules and regulations. “Our existing rules are laws, government regulations, presidential regulations, ministerial regulations and so on, including a regulation from the police chief himself. That should be the ground rule,” Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung said. Jokowi summoned Tito on Monday following the decision by police chiefs in Bekasi in West Java and Kulon Progo regency in Yogyakarta to issue circulars ordering local officers to uphold an edict issued by the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) banning Muslims from wearing Christmas attributes, such as Santa hats. The MUI issued the fatwa on Dec. 14. Bekasi Police issued its circular on Dec. 15 while Kulonprogo Police released its circular on Dec. 17. Over the weekend, police in Surabaya, East Java, also came under fire for their failure to prevent members of the hardline Islam Defenders Front (FPI) from cracking down on business establishments that allowed their employees to wear Christmas attributes. Earlier on Monday, Tito ordered police officers to get tough on members and activists of hardline groups who carried out intolerant acts. “I instruct all police officers to arrest and take action against those who want to promote disorder. We shouldn’t bow to those groups,” Tito said. Tito also ordered members of the corps to keep an eye on groups that carried out intolerant acts under the guise of publicity programs for the MUI edicts. “Also, if we find some groups that carry out raids while claiming to be conducting ‘familiarization’, but in fact bring fear to people, we must take the initiative to stop them,” Tito said. The police chief said that he would discuss the issue with the MUI in the coming days. “I will talk with the MUI so that they take tolerance and Bhinneka Tunggal Ika [the country’s motto of “unity in diversity”] into consideration when they want to issue a fatwa,” he added. Jan Sihar Aritonang, a professor at the Theology School Jakarta, said that the MUI had wrongly identified symbols of consumerism, such as the Santa hat, as part of Christianity. “Production and distribution of such attributes are not directly related to Christianity. Until now, Christian churches have never reached any consensus about what could be considered as attributes or symbols for Christmas. They are just a tradition in some churches, particularly in Europe and America,” Jan said. Responding to the actions of the FPI in Surabaya, the MUI said that any Muslim groups that took the initiative to disseminate information regarding the Christmas edict should not use force against business owners who were unaware of the call. “The information about the fatwa can be relayed by sending one person to inform shop owners about it, or a letter should be enough,” said the MUI’s edict division head, Hasanuddin AF. Religious Affairs Minister Lukman Hakim Saifuddin meanwhile said that no private organizations had the authority to conduct such raids.

"Tue, December 20 2016","Police protect, serve — who?","Ahead of a supposedly joyful season bringing peaceful tidings, Indonesians are instead seeing more tension — fueled by police action. As part of their task to safeguard Christmas celebrations, the police escorted members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) to “disseminate information” about a new edict, of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) to seven shopping centers in the country’s second largest city, Surabaya, East Java, on Sunday. A shopping center manager said the management would comply with the new edict which states management should not force Muslim employees to wear “non-Muslim attributes”. Police said they escorted the FPI “to ensure public safety” and prevent clashes. The edict issued on Dec. 14 followed rumors of Muslim employees being “forced” to don Christmas- related accessories. Reports said FPI visits to store managements took place following rumors that a Honda dealer in Bekasi, West Java, forced staffers, including those wearing hijabs, to wear Santa Claus hats. The MUI’s edicts are non-binding; Muslims refer to them as personal guidelines to review daily beliefs and practice. For instance, although managements should indeed not impose anything on employees regarding religion, many Muslims would distance themselves from edicts like the latest one containing repeated references to kafir (infidels) — which would include their Christian friends and relatives. Many do not see voluntary participation in Christmas preparations or festivities as disrupting their Muslim faith. However, police escorting the FPI, known as a vigilante group, in introducing the edict was crossing the line. Taxpayers funding the police are not only Muslims, although few are surprised these days at the smug ties between the police and vigilante groups claiming to represent the nation’s Islamic majority. Police repeatedly remind us they protect and serve all citizens, but their actions are far from convincing. A leader of the largest Muslim organization, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), said the MUI is obliged to inform the public of its edicts. The state should not “let any mass organization exercise its own law on the streets,” NU deputy secretary general Imam Putudu said. Yet of course vigilante groups increasingly feel they are doing a sacred duty when escorted by police in “visiting” store managers by the dozens. In the past, police have also escorted various groups claiming to represent Muslims in disrupting religious services and closing down mosques of minorities. The police have thus failed their credibility tests in ensuring they protect and serve us all. They do not even protect Muslims who could be seen as an increasing threat to the legacy of a peaceful, diverse nation. This is in conflict with the message of participants of the recent rallies, triggered by allegations of the Jakarta Governor insulting Islam, which said the rallies were reminders of inter-faith respect. National Police chief. Gen. Tito Karnavian, a former counterterrorism special unit chief, must join national and religious leaders in ensuring peace for us all — instead of signaling that police support people infamously known to have quite often taken the law into their own hands.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/12/20/police-protect-serve-who.html,,2016
"Wed, December 21 2016",Progressive Muslims need to wake up and smell the coffee,"Christmas is around the corner and Islam Defenders Front (FPI) members have clamped down on Santa hats at shopping malls in Surabaya, the country’s second largest city. That is not a picture of a merry Christmas. What is worse, however, is that the police were escorting the hard-liners when they entered the mall to prevent “disruptions” during what the FPI called, without a sense of irony, aksi damai (peaceful action). No matter how the FPI and the police explain it, the Surabaya incident is a serious blow to the nation’s dwindling pluralism. It is disturbing for three simple reasons. First, the Indonesian Ulema Council’s fatwa banning Muslims from wearing Christmas paraphernalia is not legally binding and therefore should not be enforced; second, FPI militants, a fringe group (at least until recently), may not be the best people to disseminate the fatwa to the Christians; third, the police helping the FPI to carry out its antics sends the wrong message to minority groups who are wary of the group’s growing clout. The incident, depressing as it is, is a clear reminder of two indubitable facts: that retrograde forces are gaining ground in the country and a fringe group, like the FPI, has become more mainstream and normalized. The Dec. 2 rally against Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama in Jakarta, the largest gathering of people the country has seen in history, is a testament to the popular support the hard-liners currently hold. It appears that as Islamic parties succumb to realpolitik for their survival, forcing them to act more secular and nationalistic and thus making them less appealing to their core constituents, hard-liner groups have filled the void and emerged as political demagogues that have exploited the inevitable rise of identity politics. That shift has huge ramifications. The police have often been accused of being too soft on the FPI, as the vigilante group allegedly has the backing of the powerful elites. That may still be the case, but the problem we have now is perhaps the police are unwilling to get tough on the FPI because they fear it would trigger backlashes from mainstream Muslims. If that is the case, we should be more alarmed. The last thing we need is a vigilante group empowered by both the elite and the masses. The question is: how did we get to this situation? The power hungry political elites played a role in empowering radicals to advance their short-term interests, but the elephant in the room is the failure of Indonesian progressives to keep the FPI marginal. Progressive Muslims are complacent. They should push the hard-liners further to the fringe. What they have been doing is the complete opposite: pushing mainstream Muslims, who traditionally have a moderate view of Islam, closer to the FPI and thus making the fringe group mainstream. Many Indonesian Muslim intellectuals are fixated on shaming and discrediting the hard-liners that they end up alienating most Muslims. This problem persists even after the two major anti-Ahok rallies in Jakarta. A renowned liberal Muslim intellectual, for instance, called those who joined the Nov. 14 rally “brutal” and “stupid”. A female Muslim academic disparages women who joined the Dec. 2 rally as mere “child caretakers”. Such comments disregarded the complexity of Indonesian Islam. The people joining the anti-Ahok rallies are not monolith and should not be put in a single basket of degrading stereotypes. If anything, those words would do nothing but widen the ideological divide, making it more difficult for other progressives to reach out to mainstream Muslims and change their views about Islam, democracy and the need for peaceful coexistence. On social media, most progressive Muslims also turned out to be as gullible as their retrograde rivals in sharing half-truths, fake news and hoaxes. That bad habit has deepened ideological polarization to the advantage of the radicals, who typically excel at exploiting conflicts and divisions. The other issue is the double standards exposed by many progressive Muslims when responding to the state’s actions against their ideological rivals. There is an alarming tendency, for example, among progressive Muslims to consider state repression as “normal”, as the only way to keep the FPI and its ilk under control. This kind of attitude will only bring sympathy to the hard-liners. Perhaps the greatest blunder progressive Muslims have made is their failure to go beyond identity politics — or “identity liberalism”, to use the term coined by Columbia University historian Mark Lilla. For progressives, the only democratic goal worth pursuing is for minority groups — Christians, Shias, Ahmadis and LGBTs — to live in peace. It is as if Indonesia’s problems will magically go away if the FPI is gone. Consequently, they were mostly, and regrettably, silent when the political powers they supported persecuted the poor. They ignore the fact that the economically marginalized are mostly part of the Muslim majority. The hard-liners will find it easy to sectarianize the issue of economic equality, by claiming that progressives do not care about the majority, who then feel excluded from the progressives’ agenda. Indonesian progressives must learn from American liberals who spent months before Election Day in November shaming Donald Trumps’ supporters, the white working class who felt excluded from Hillary Clinton’s liberal identity campaign. The result is nightmarish: Trump’s victory. So, wake up and smell the coffee before it is too late.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/12/21/progressive-muslims-need-wake-and-smell-coffee.html,,2016
"Wed, December 28 2016",The Pope is waging war against Christmas -- let's join him!,"Is the pope Catholic? Well, he is the leader of the Catholic Church, so yes, he is. Duh. Then why is he waging war against Christmas? Will he gang up with the notorious Islam Defenders Front (FPI) in Indonesia which is also waging war against Christmas? The FPI are famous for conducting “sweeping” (raids). Recently, they attempted to sweep malls in cities in Java, to prevent mall employees from wearing Christmas paraphernalia, the most common being Santa hats. That’s amusing as the famous red and white Santa outfit is actually a commercial attribute, not a religious one. The fat, jolly, white-bearded Santa Claus figure ubiquitous when approaching Christmas day in modern times was adopted and developed by Coca-Cola to match their company colors and market their fizzy drink (see “Politics of Muslim identity over Santa outfits”, The Jakarta Post, Dec. 20). The Pope’s war against Christmas however, is about returning Christmas to its true essence. The holy feast has been “kidnapped” by worldliness, Francis says, and needs to be “liberated” from the bourgeois, materialistic charade it has become. “The lights of shop windows push the light of God into the shadows… [People] enthused about gifts, but indifferent to our neighbors in need.” Pope Francis points out that many people suffer because of the economic ambitions of a few, “because of sheer greed and idolatry, which leads to slavery”. If Francis sounds like a leftie, it is not really surprising because his boss, Jesus, was a socialist too. In Matthew 6:24 Jesus says “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.” Perhaps Donald Trump missed Matthew 6:24 when he read the Bible (if he read it at all, that is) because he thinks that Christianity starts in the marketplace. One of his campaign promises: “I get elected president, we’re going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ [at department stores] again.” Ah Trump, the department store messiah whose god is clearly mammon. So in the eyes of Jesus, Trump cannot really be a Christian, despite his claims. In the United States, the custom has been to wish customers “Happy Holidays” rather than “Merry Christmas” during the Christmas and New Years season, out of respect for people of other faiths. It’s political correctness, which Trump hates. Instead of political correctness, in Indonesia we have what you might call “religious correctness”. Up to now there is still the debate as to whether it’s haram or not for Muslims to wish Christians “Merry Christmas”. In spite of the fact that the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) issued a fatwa forbidding Muslims to wear Christmas paraphernalia, on the issue of Muslims wishing Christians “Merry Christmas”, MUI allowed it. Despite the MUI fatwa, at a recent event to commemorate Indonesia’s fourth president Abdurachman “Gus Dur” Wahid, Alim, a participant, stole the show by wearing a Santa hat! Don’t you just love that? Clearly religious tolerance trumps (sic!) religious correctness for Alim! So how do Indonesians celebrate Christmas? Much like Idul Fitri, it’s very commercialized. But behind this public display of religious commodification, there are people who subscribe to Pope Francis’ injunction to humility, “smallness” and to serve the unfortunate and marginalized. Take my friend Maria for example. She’s always very busy around Christmas as she’s involved in various social activities to visit and give donations to members of the church who are ill, the elderly, and those who are in prison; organizing Christmas celebrations for youth as well as the adult church community. On Christmas day itself, she attends church service, and only then does she go home to celebrate with the family. Like Islam in Indonesia, Christianity is also syncretic, combining many local and Christian customs. The Javanese for example combine their Christian beliefs with kejawen (Javanese spiritualism), and their Christmas tree is not a fir tree, but made out of paper, wooden decorations and recycled material. How environmentally conscious! In Bali, their Christmas trees are made from chicken feature. I wonder if they turn it into a feather duster after Christmas ends? The Torajans of South Sulawesi do not just sing Indonesian language Christmas carols but also their local ethnic songs, and wear traditional costumes. Manado, North Sulawesi, is sometimes called the Christian capital of Indonesia because they purportedly having the highest number of Christians in the country. They also claim to have the biggest Christmas tree in Asia, located at the Mega Mas Boulevard. Funded by donations, it’s meant to be a symbol of religious brotherhood. In Papua, after Christmas mass, the Papuans light up the barapen (grilling stone) for the ritual cooking of pork. The barapen is a hole in the ground where hot stones are placed, then a layer of meat, sweet potatoes, cassava, fern, spinach and papaya, then another layer of stone and so forth until they have three layers. The barapen tradition is an expression of togetherness, gratitude, sharing and love. Between 1999 and 2002, the Maluku islands suffered a period of ugly sectarian conflict in which the aftermath took a while to resolve. Fortunately now peace has been restored. The celebration of Christmas includes a ceremony called cuci negeri (cleaning the nation), which symbolizes a purification and liberation of the people and environment from sin. I reckon the whole of Indonesia should engage in cuci negeri! So in many parts of Indonesia, Christmas is totally devoid of commercialism. It all sounds pretty ideal, doesn’t it? While Christmas is a time for joy, peace and sharing, it’s also a time when Christians in Indonesia start to get anxious. The recent FPI sweeping of Christmas attributes is mild compared to the Christmas Eve bombing in eight cities in 2000, which resulted in casualties and fatalities. Unfortunately, Muslim extremists do not necessarily wait for Christmas to persecute Christians. Just google “discrimination against Christians in modern Indonesia”, your heart will ache to read the stories. I reckon we — Christians and Muslims alike — should heed the war cry of Pope Francis, to fight not just against the commercialization of Christmas, but also against bigotry, ignorance, arrogance, greed, and aim for tolerance, humility, compassion, sharing and love for our fellow sisters and brothers, of whatever faith. Maybe start by just a simple act of wearing the Santa hat as Alim did. If the intention is to wear it as an expression of tolerance, then it’s a good thing, no? __________________________________ The writer is the author of Julia’s Jihad.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/12/28/let-s-join-pope-war-against-commercialized-christmas.html,,2016
"Sat, December 31 2016",Greater Jakarta: FPI leader’s blasphemy case to proceed,"Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Mochammad Iriawan has given his assurance that the police will process the lawsuit filed by a group of university students against Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab for allegedly defaming Christianity in one of his speeches. Iriawan said the police would treat the case just like any other case. “Why wouldn’t we have the guts [to investigate Rizieq]?” Iriawan asked when a journalist questioned whether the police would dare to process the case against the leader of the mass organization whose members had been involved in many raids against places they considered “un-Islamic”. “We are still investigating the case. If we feel it is necessary to carry out a case reconstruction, we will do so,” Iriawan said. Rizieq has been reported by the Indonesian Catholic Students Association (PMKRI) for allegedly committing blasphemy in a speech circulated on the Internet. Rizieq was reported along with two other people who allegedly uploaded Rizieq’s video to Instagram and Twitter. In the 22-second video, Rizieq is recorded saying: “If God gave birth, then who would be the midwife?” Rizieq is accused of violating Article 156 section (a) of the Criminal Code on blasphemy. The charge carries a maximum punishment of five years in prison. The FPI has said it will report the people who filed the lawsuit against Rizieq for defamation or slander.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/12/31/greater-jakarta-fpi-leader-s-blasphemy-case-proceed.html,,2016

"Wed, January 4 2017",Police bar media from covering Ahok trial,"The police forcefully prevented reporters from all media organizations from entering the venue of the fourth hearing of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama’s blasphemy trial on Tuesday, disregarding confirmation from the judges that print and online media journalists could cover the hearing. As a result, reporters relied on comments made outside the auditorium of the Agriculture Ministry on Jl. RM Harsono in Pasar Minggu, South Jakarta, which has been converted into a makeshift courtroom. Presiding judge Dwiarso Budi Santiarto said upon opening the session that the hearing was only closed to television journalists. “Online and paper journalists are allowed to cover the hearing, but television journalists are not allowed, so you can exit the room,” he said during the hearing. In the judicial system, civilian hearings are open to the public and the media. However, there are exceptions in certain circumstances, such as trials of juvenile cases or crimes related to sexual abuse. Supreme Court spokesman Suhadi previously said TV stations would not be allowed to air the hearing live until the stage of the trial where the prosecutors read out their sentence demands and the defendant offered his defense plea. In reality, reporters from any form of media were barred from entering the courtroom. Fikri Faqih, a reporter from a national online news outlet, said he was inside the courtroom until the police asked visitors to leave their cell phones outside. “After we left the room to put our mobile phones outside, the police prohibited us from going back in,” Fikri said, adding that he was disappointed by the police’s policy. According to Fikri, the police said the room could not accommodate all the reporters. “The police hindered our job as journalists to cover and record the trial, even though there was no such order from the judges,” he added. Fikri’s feelings were shared by dozens of other journalists who were at the building hours before the hearing was scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. South Jakarta Police chief Sr. Comr. Iwan Kurniawan claimed the police had conducted themselves in accordance with the court’s order. “We apologize that not all journalists could enter the venue because the room’s capacity was limited,” Iwan said. Spokesman from the North Jakarta District Court Didik Wuryanto said the hearing of witness testimony could not be aired live to maintain the trial’s integrity. “It is to prevent the witnesses from listening to each other’s testimonies. Therefore, they will only convey what they know before the judges, not an opinion resulting from what they hear from other people’s testimony,” Didik said. The hearing on Tuesday saw four witnesses presented by the prosecutors deliver their testimonies. They were Islam Defenders Front (FPI) Jakarta branch secretary-general Novel Bamukmin, Sharia Advocate Chairman Gus Joy Setiawan, FPI Jakarta head Muchsin and the head of Antiblasphemy Forum Syamsu Hilal. The Supreme Court agreed to relocate Ahok’s trial to the auditorium because of security reasons. The police asked the court to relocate the trial because hundreds of people had staged demonstrations at every hearing at the North Jakarta District Court, which is temporarily using the old Central Jakarta District Court on Jl. Gajah Mada in Central Jakarta. However, hundreds of demonstrators, both supporters and opponents of Ahok, visited the new venue on Tuesday and staged rallies around the complex. Tuesday’s hearing ended at 8 p.m. and the trial has been adjourned until Dec. 10 when more witness testimonies will be heard.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/04/police-bar-media-covering-ahok-trial.html,,2017

"Mon, January 9 2017",National scene: TNI officer removed over FPI training,"Siliwangi Military Command removed the Lebak Military Commander Lt. Col. Ubadillah for an alleged procedural breach in giving training to members of the notorious hard-line Muslim group the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) in a state defense program in Lebak, Banten last week. “Lebak Military commander did not report to the Military Resort Commander and Siliwangi Military Commader before holding the training,” Siliwangi Military Command spokesperson Lt.Col. Desi Ariyanto said in a press statement on Sunday. Therefore, Siliwangi Military Commander decided to strip Ubaidillah from his post. His position will soon be replaced by a new officer, Desi added. Several FPI members were among the 100 Islamic students, locally known as santri, who participated in a state defense program in Lebak on Thursday and Friday. The government has been criticized for the state defense program, a paramilitary training for civilians, which is aimed at eradicating thuggery, radicalism and drug abuse. Critics said that a training program with the ninth regional military command Udayana (Kodam IX), held in Bali in June, included gang members and other unauthorized organizations reportedly learning how to use firearms. Desi denied accusations that there were exercises using firearms in the training and that the training was designed for the FPI. “It was just a physical training and the program was available to everyone,” he said. The FPI has been in the spotlight recently for organizing sectarian rallies against Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, demanding his prosecution.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/09/national-scene-tni-officer-removed-over-fpi-training.html,,2017
"Mon, January 9 2017",Election campaign turns ugly,"Police and election authorities are under pressure following another reported incident of violence against the campaign of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama and his running mate Djarot Syaiful Hidayat a month before voting day. The West Jakarta District Court last month sentenced a man to two months in jail with a four-month probation for disrupting Ahok’s campaign. That verdict, apparently, did not deter others from disrupting Ahok-Djarot campaign events. In separate incidents last Friday, people claiming to be locals protested against Ahok and Djarot, who were on campaign visits in Lenteng Agung, South Jakarta, and Jelambar, West Jakarta, respectively. In Jelambar, Widodo, a supporter of the incumbent ticket who stood up for the incumbent deputy governor when the disruption took place, ended up with severe injuries after several people, reportedly members of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), beat him up. “The victim, Widodo, was beaten by about 10 men. Because of the incident, he is currently hospitalized for injuries to his eyes and head,” West Jakarta Police chief Sr. Comr. Roycke Langie told The Jakarta Post on Saturday. Widodo and one of the suspects were on Jl. Jelambar Utama, where Djarot was on an impromptu campaign visit. Sitting at a neighborhood watch post, the suspect and four other men reportedly shouted at the deputy governor, calling him and Ahok blasphemers. There was widespread protest late last year over allegedly blasphemous remarks by Ahok during a speech in September. Members of conservative Islamic groups staged at least three large rallies in Jakarta to demand the prosecution of the governor. Ahok has been indicted for blasphemy and is currently standing trial at the North Jakarta District Court. Widodo, an ojek (motorcycle taxi) driver and local member of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) that supports the ticket, approached the suspect and reprimanded him, saying such action was unacceptable. “Based on the victim’s testimony, the suspect is his neighbor. So, given that the suspect was his close neighbor, the victim felt a responsibility to remind him [not to engage in illegal action],” said Roycke. However, the suspect seemed to be offended as he and several men hours later approached and immediately assaulted Widodo, who was sitting at a food stall near his house, according to Roycke. Widodo was rushed to the Royal Taruma Hospital in West Jakarta, while family members reported the attack to Tanjung Duren Police. West Jakarta Police subsequently took over the case and questioned the victim, in addition to some witnesses, said Roycke. After initial questioning of the victim, police identified another suspect, but no suspect had been arrested as of Saturday. Djarot, who paid a visit to the hospital to see Widodo, called the incident a case of “barbaric democracy”. “If you do not agree with us, you can just not vote for us, rather than beat people up like this,” he added. Ahok echoed Djarot’s sentiment. “All we are asking for is some space [to campaign],” said Ahok. In Lenteng Agung, two men carrying green flags that read “Forum Warga Lenteng Agung” (Lenteng Agung Residents Forum) disrupted Ahok’s campaign. Jagakarsa Police officers were immediately on scene and apprehended the men. “I don’t want Ahok to be here,” said one of the men, who claimed to be a local resident. Ahok-Djarot campaign team spokesman Bestari Barus said the disruptions violated the candidate pair’s legally guaranteed right to campaign. “Such action also violates democracy,” Bestari told the Post on Sunday. He slammed the Jakarta General Elections Commission (KPU Jakarta) and the Jakarta Elections Supervisory Agency (Bawaslu) for failing to carry out their task to oversee the campaign. “Visiting residential areas across the city to hold campaign [events] is the right of every candidate,” KPU Jakarta head Sumarno told the Post. Separately, Jakarta FPI secretary general Novel Chaidir Hasan Bamukmin said he could not confirm whether the suspects were FPI members. He denied Widodo’s claim that he had been beaten by 10 men. “No bystanders wanted to help Widodo because they also did not like him. He then ran and told the police he had been beaten by a group of men,” Novel said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/09/election-campaign-turns-ugly.html,,2017
"Tue, January 10 2017","‘Work, work and work’ isn’t enough: Anies","Anies Baswedan - JP/Wienda Parwitasari In his article “Don’t Just Do something, Talk”, eccentric Slovenian philosopher Slavoj _i_ek writes: “we often talk about doing something instead of actually doing it — but sometimes we do things in order to avoid talking and thinking about them.” That quotation may sum up gubernatorial candidate Anies Baswedan’s criticism of his opponent, incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama and, also, Anies’ former boss, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo. Anies once served as a minister in Jokowi’s Cabinet. During his visit to The Jakarta Post ’s office on Monday, the gubernatorial hopeful, who was listed among the world’s top 100 public intellectuals by Foreign Policy in 2008, lamented the fact that fewer people these days appreciated the value of ideas and dialogue. “To be honest, in recent years, the country seems to no longer have any appreciation for ideas. Words seem to be unimportant. Meanwhile, [many think] what matters is work, work, work,” Anies said in an apparent jab at Jokowi’s famous tagline. Jokowi, who fired Anies in August last year, has described his administration as the “Working Cabinet” in a thinly veiled attack against preceding administrations. Ahok, Jokowi’s deputy when the latter was governor of Jakarta, shares Jokowi’s general philosophy and, during his term as governor, has focused his energy on getting things done, a trait that has apparently earned him both praise and derision. For Anies, building Jakarta needs more than just work. It also needs ideas and words. “It is not ‘we should talk less and work more,’ but ‘we should talk a lot and work a lot,’” Anies said. “ A leader must lead and therefore he has to talk. Therefore, what I offer is: ideas, words and action,” he added. During his speech, Anies repeated his criticisms of Ahok’s leadership, arguing that the incumbent was focused too much on building “inanimate objects” and had overlooked the necessity of building human resources. He was referring to Ahok’s focus on expediting infrastructure development and what he claims to be Ahok’s lack of attention toward the city’s poor. The former rector of Paramadina University said that, if elected, he would engage the public to develop Jakarta and close the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots”. He said he would invite the private sector to help the city administration alleviate poverty. “There are so many kind people in Jakarta. Kindness is contagious. All people must be called upon to engage in [developing the city],” he said, citing his experience with Indonesia Mengajar (Teach for Indonesia), which he founded, as proof that asking people to help other people was not impossible. He said it was important to invite everyone, regardless of their background, to contribute to the city. In his attempt to engage the public, Anies has held meetings with a number of communities, including members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). His meeting with the FPI has drawn criticism from both his detractors and some of his supporters. Anies defended his decision to visit the headquarters of the FPI in Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta, saying that he was there to clarify rumors about him that could seriously hurt his chances in the election. He said he had been accused of being a Shiite, a liberal Muslim and a Wahabbi, a pejorative term used to refer to the strain of Islam widely practiced in Saudi Arabia. The accusations have circulated for years but he had never taken them seriously until he decided to run for office, Anies said, adding that religion turned out to be an important issue for Jakarta’s voters. “On the campaign trail, many voters asked me what my religion was. Not only that, they also asked whether my Islam was the true Islam or not. Then, they asked whether I was a Sunni or a Shiite. These are serious questions,” he said. “Therefore, I think it is important to clarify [the rumors].”",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/10/work-work-and-work-isn-t-enough-anies.html,,2017

Andreas, who is also a member of House of Representatives Commission I that oversees defense affairs, called on the military as well as the Defense Ministry to thoroughly review the defense training policy.

"Fri, January 13 2017","Growing a spine, finally","In the past decade, the country has seen worsening cases of religious intolerance, some of which have escalated into acts of violence. Rights group the Setara Institute reported that in 2007, there were 91 cases of religious violence against minorities in the country, such as Christians, Shi’a, Ahmadiyah and other groups that subscribe to indigenous faiths. The figure shot to 257 in 2008 and rose again to 264 in 2012. In 2013, Setara reported 220 cases of violence. Most cases involved radical Sunni groups, the most prominent being the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), which can launch its campaigns and attacks almost without impunity. The timeline matters here, because the worsening violations of minority groups’ rights happened during the tenure of former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. If there is one thing that both supporters and critics of Yudhoyono can agree upon, it is that he was fond of lofty rhetoric. During his two-term presidency, hard-liner groups gained a free hand to perpetrate violence, at times with the complicity of government officials. President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo took office promising to tackle the problem. In his Nawa Cita (nine-point development program) campaign platform, Jokowi promised to strengthen the country’s basic principle of Unity in Diversity. Realizing his campaign promises has been an uphill struggle for Jokowi, who early in his tenure had to juggle between governing and maintaining the balance of political power. He also has to be careful not to muddy the water and risk losing much-needed support from Muslim groups. As a result, early in his administration, Jokowi performed no better than his predecessor. In fact, there was a significant rise in cases of religious intolerance from 177 in 2014 to 236 in 2015, according to Setara. But 2016 was the year when the government took the threat seriously. The large-scale street protests calling for the prosecution of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, which was spearheaded by groups like the FPI, was a wake-up call for Jokowi, who finally realized that the groups could pose a serious threat to his grip on power. This time it was easier for Jokowi to take action. He has his trusted Gen. Tito Karnavian in charge of the National Police and Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo as Indonesian Military (TNI) commander. Recently, the Jakarta Police launched multiple probes against FPI leader Rizieq Shihab for a variety of offenses, from insulting the Christian faith to claiming that the new rupiah banknotes carried the logo of the now defunct Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). Last week, the Siliwangi Military Command in West Java dismissed Lebak military commander Lt. Col. Ubaidillah from his position for holding a state defense training session for members of the FPI without the consent of his superiors. A red line has been drawn.

"Fri, January 13 2017",Fighting the hard-liners online,"Global connectivity has brought many new opportunities, but it has also bred a new generation of threats. Many believe that social media is a mirror of society — one that reflects all manner of human interests and ideas, invariably extending into the realm of politics and violence. Researchers have found that online behavior is dominated by “homophily”: a tendency to listen to and associate with people like yourself, and to exclude outsiders. People come together when facing a shared “antagonist” that they think is too strong to be faced by individuals. This behavior makes social networks bad at helping you empathize with people not like you. People want their beliefs affirmed and they want to demonize the opposition at every turn. Social media platforms reinforce “us versus them” narratives, expose vulnerable people to destructive ideologies and even intensify long-dormant hatreds. Cass Sunstein, an American legal scholar, says that people who hear only similar voices end up polarized. He also pointed to a wealth of evidence that suggests homogenous groups breed extreme views. Nowadays, creating conflicts is as easy as putting our thumbs to our smartphones. The outcome of such conflicts will be determined heavily by activities in cyberspace. False news on social media is made to divide communities. Psychological operations are now tech-enabled. Social media creates massive groundswells of popular opinion that are nearly impossible to predict or control. The invention of camera phones changed how we view conditions on the field and can shape such opinions. Worryingly, the more extreme the personality and sensibility of the author, the more popular he or she or a group is on social media. The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) is an Islamic mass organization with an interesting violent history. In 2011, armed with machetes and bamboo sticks, FPI members stormed the Ahmadiyah mosque and attacked the worshippers in South Sulawesi. At another time, the FPI successfully rallied to imprison the editor of Indonesia’s very tame version of Playboy Magazine. The group even generated global headlines when it successfully prevented US pop star Lady Gaga from performing a concert in Jakarta by threatening to burn down the arena. In the wake of depressing circumstances, many Muslims long for a strong leader who is brave enough to fight immoral behavior and able to unite the ideology and politically fractured ummah (community). The ultimate goal is to realize an Islamic state. The FPI smartly exploits this idea. The big turning point for the FPI was its success in mobilizing and organizing thousands of people in relatively peaceful anti-Ahok rallies on Nov. 4 and Dec. 2. The protests did not degenerate into chaos as many had feared, and other big Islamic organizations and ulema even showed sympathy and support for them. Then, just like that, the FPI suddenly became an idol. ____________________ Extremist groups have long used the internet to promote medieval ideologies. The FPI has proved adept in its use of social media platforms, running a sophisticated propaganda campaign. The group put a lot of pre-planning into its social media of how they moved their supporters from all around Indonesia. The true purpose of FPI pictures or videos on organizing a rally on Twitter and Facebook is not to shock the authority; the purpose is to recruit like-minded zealots for their cause. The propaganda is designed to encourage like-minded communities to support the organization. Twitter and Facebook are both open and public by nature. This means that the FPI has the ability to not only capture images, but also to spread them to the people who are likely to react to them and create a bigger impact. It also means the images will be in people’s consciousness forever. Extremist groups have long used the internet to promote medieval ideologies. The Islamic State was a fantasy in 2004, now look at it. ISIS’ social media is capable of attracting people, including professionals such as doctors and not necessarily unemployed or illiterate people as widely believed. Innovations in cyberspace in the commercial world have to be understood so that its impact on society, the military and the economy may be anticipated. Today’s government has to tackle all theaters of war, including cyberspace. The fight against violent or extremist messaging on social media has become more important than ever. The rehearsal for the national audience has been accomplished with the success of two big demonstrations against Ahok in Jakarta. We do not know what the FPI is fully capable of, but we have seen them take down Jakarta in one night. If 2016 has taught us anything, it is to never underestimate how wrong anything can go. Remember, violent delights have violent ends. ____________________________ The author is a lawyer in a prominent law firm in South Jakarta.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/13/fighting-hard-liners-online.html,,2017
"Fri, January 13 2017",MUI leader turned away from Sintang for alleged insult,"Blocked: Tengku Zulkarnain is confronted by members of the Dayak tribe while disembarking a plane at Susilo Airport in Sintang, West Kalimantan, on Thursday.(Tribunnews.com) A welcoming ceremony for visiting guests attending the inauguration of a local leader turned hostile at an airport in Sintang, West Kalimantan, on Thursday after the host group rejected a Muslim cleric in the entourage. Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) deputy secretary Tengku Zulkarnain, who traveled along with Dayak Culture Council (DAD) leaders from Pontianak, was rejected by a group of people after he had just arrived at the airport to attend the inauguration of a local head of the DAD. The cleric was turned away because he had allegedly insulted the Dayak. Zulkarnain stood at the airplane’s doorway ready to disembark when the reception group from DAD, who were wearing Dayak traditional clothes along with mandau (traditional daggers), blocked his way, preventing him from disembarking the plane. DAD said in a statement that they rejected Zulkarnain because he allegedly insulted the Dayaks by allegedly calling them kafir (a derogatory Islamic term for non-believers) who could not go to heaven. The Dayak people embrace folk faiths, including the Kaharingan. “The people of Dayak do not hate MUI. We have just rejected a particular individual, in this case MUI deputy secretary Tengku Zulkarnain, for insulting the Dayak tribe,” the group said in a statement. The group said they had seen Zulkarnain’s sectarian and vitriolic remarks on the internet. Zulkarnain is also alleged to have connections with the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI). A large banner brought by the group read: “FPI, a mass organization that is against Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution, should be disbanded because it has disrupted peace in Indonesia”. Due of the incident, Zulkarnain and two of his colleagues could not leave the airport. They eventually flew back to Pontianak at 10:30 a.m. Samson, a local resident who witnessed the incident at the airport, said Zulkarnain’s plane landed in Sintang for about 40 minutes before flying back to Pontianak after all the Sintang passengers got off. “The rejected person just observed, but he did not get off,” Samson said. Zulkarnain told The Jakarta Post that he was shocked to see a group of approximately 30 people, who were wearing Dayak traditional clothes and carrying mandau, suddenly blocking his way. “They said I came there with FPI members. How come? I came there on behalf of the MUI. I was invited by the [Sintang] regent and the region’s MUI branch to be a speaker in a mass prayer,” Zulkarnain said. He also denied having insulted the Dayak. “It’s a lie. I never said anything like that. Just check my social media accounts. Prove it,” he said. West Kalimantan Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Suhadi SW said the group initially arrived at the airport to welcome DAD West Kalimantan leaders from Pontianak. “The group learned that Zulkarnain had also arrived that day and so the group moved to oppose his arrival,” Suhadi said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/13/mui-leader-turned-away-sintang-alleged-insult.html,,2017
"Sat, January 14 2017",Urban chat: New Year and the Surreal New Normal,"M erriam-Webster Dictionary’s word of the year last year was “surreal”, which perfectly sums up how 2016 pretty much was worldwide and, like it or not, prepares us for 2017 onward. I personally think Merriam-Webster was being kind, because I would have picked “insane” as the word of the year. Insanity was abound not just in far-flung parts of the world — Brexit, Trump, Syria — but also in corners right here at home. Just look at the escalating tensions over ethnicity and religion lately, partly thanks to the rise of conservatism in recent decades. I’ve never been a fan of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama and frankly I think what he said about Al-Maidah 51 was unwise and uncalled for, but catering to the incessant demands of hard-liner groups like the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), who portray this as a holy war for all, is just as unnecessary in the short run as it is dangerous in the long run. That the President shared a stage momentarily with an FPI leader during a mass rally and a gubernatorial candidate felt the urge to pay respects to the FPI are not being practical in politics. It normalizes the likes of the FPI in state affairs. Why are we normalizing vigilantes? Why does the establishment fear vigilantes? Our taxes still pay for the armed police and the military, yet we kowtow to vigilantes armed with white robes and batons often enough to set precedence for their ilk to demand even more in the future. It is so insane it’s surreal — I should get my tax money back. Judging from Donald Trump’s first press conference as the United States president-elect, it’s probably what some American taxpayers are also thinking about. Not only after winning the election was he baited into outbursts, whether through an award acceptance speech or a mere tweet, but he also publicly had a shouting match with a reporter and denied answering another, in addition to repeating baseless claims about Mexico paying for a border wall, which prompted no less than the former Mexican president to tweet a rebuke. Is this the new normal — executive elites exchange disagreements casually over social media posts instead of vetted diplomatic channels? Is it also the new normal for journalism, supposedly the vanguard of democracy, when other journalists don’t come to their colleagues’ rescue upon public mistreatment by an establishment that’s represented by Trump? It is so insane it’s surreal, especially when taking place less than 24 hours after US President Barack Obama’s lucid farewell address on human rights and responsible information, that I wonder if some of Trump’s voters secretly wished to take their vote back. Don’t get me started on how educated and moneyed people around me have started to believe and distribute hoaxes, from vaccines to religion, on WhatsApp groups and Facebook, without using the same fancy gadget to at least try Googling trustworthy, impartial news sources. It is so insane it’s surreal — their schools should take their diplomas back. No wonder so many icons departed last year — the cool set refused to join us on the spiraling rat race down the intelligence gutter. It is indeed the age of smartphones, when the phones are smarter than some humans using it. My feng shui devotee friend blames it all, including the sad state of economies, on the mischievous Year of the Monkey that started early February 2016 and will end this month. While it’s indeed a tempting notion to assume that 7 billion human beings have fallen victim to supernatural mega forces that reduce us to an unintelligent and irrational pack for the past 11 months, it’s simply irresponsible to rest our fate on the turns of an ancient calendar. Obama advised to start engaging in real life with the people you disagree with online. Not only do I resolutely agree with that idea, but I’m going out on a limb here to suggest people to take up reading again — reading academic science books instead of pseudoscience or science fiction; reading history books taking into account all sides instead of relying on salacious conspiracy theories posted on people’s social media accounts; reading holy books with an inquisitive mind instead of inflamed loins. If after reading books voraciously you still have resources left, allow me to indulge you to try traveling to places you’ve never been in order to meet different people on their own turf. Try being the minority who needs to figure out how things are from the knowledge or wisdom only locals can offer. Try visiting downtrodden areas and see how challenging it is for science teachers at local schools with very limited tools to teach basic knowledge, like the round Earth, which your educated friends carelessly dump thanks to some fiery sermon they heard last Friday or Sunday. Even if the world seems set on enforcing a new normal for all of us, it doesn’t mean that we can’t retain some sort of sanity for ourselves. For me, I suppose, it’s even more reading, traveling and spending time with people in real life than I’ve done in recent months. In fact, I may just go to the Shangxi province in China, where Seattle-based animator Casey Latiolais’ giant rooster was sculpted in a way that bears a striking resemblance to Donald Trump, with its pompadour head and pointing finger, or to Shenzhen, where a company created a luxurious, functioning “Toilet Trump”. Perhaps in their own way, the Chinese are also trying to find their new normal. Gong Xi Fa Cai, everyone. Oh Rooster, please be less insanely surreal. __________________________________________ Lynda Ibrahim is a Jakarta-based writer with a penchant for purple, pussycats and pop culture",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/14/urban-chat-new-year-and-surreal-new-normal.html,,2017
"Tue, January 17 2017",Anies Baswedan: Public participation key to developing Jakarta,"Anies Baswedan - JP/Wienda Parwitasari Widely known as a moderate Islamic scholar, former culture and education minister, now a candidate to be Jakarta governor, Anies Baswedan made headlines when he attended a discussion at the headquarters of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI). During a recent visit to The Jakarta Post, Anies maintained that he had not changed his views on pluralism and democracy. During the interview, the founder of the Indonesia Mengajar (Teach for Indonesia) movement also talked about his candidacy and his key programs for addressing various issues in the capital. The following are the excerpts from the interview: Why did you accept the nomination? All this time, I have been encouraging my friends to accept a call to duty; a call for politics. I have even been suggesting they take part in it. As long as a person is not problematic, I will encourage him or her [to take part in politics]. If all the good people only want to pay taxes, then who is going to manage our taxes? It is funny that an unproblematic person joining politics is considered an issue, but when a problematic person takes part in politics, it is not an issue. So, we got mixed up a bit. Therefore, in September, I was asked by the PPP [the United Development Party] and PAN [the National Mandate Party] whether I was willing to be nominated [as a candidate for governor]. I said I needed some time to discuss it with my family. I also performed istikharah [an Islamic prayer to seek guidance in making a decision]. Then I made the decision. I was ready and I wanted to be consistent. How do you see the poverty problem in Jakarta? Before I had my duties in the ministry, I was active in Indonesia Mengajar to send youths to remote areas. Then I came to Jakarta. Poverty here is different from any other kinds of poverty that I had seen before. Here, [the poor] are alone with terrible pollution, inequality, uncertainty and tremendous life pressures. Hence, I see my journey in these last three months as more than just a campaign. Truly, to me, it has been a spiritual journey. The main problems in Jakarta are: first, injustice over access for all people to live in prosperity; the second is about how we build an integrated city. You have a program that promotes people’s participation in development. How would you encourage Jakartans to take part? What I am offering would be a completely different approach. First, it is movement-based. To develop this city, we can no longer use only a program approach, which is top-down. It must use a movement approach. It means that government not only does something, but also provides space for the public to be involved so that both parties act together. Public involvement is important, not only in curbing inequality and poverty, but most importantly in making Jakarta owned by all and hence making all Jakartans involved in development. Your recent visit to the FPI headquarters has drawn criticism. How would you respond to this? The people of Jakarta need to be able to interact with one another and, as a candidate, I also meet with everyone. I meet all groups and I am happy to meet any organization that invites me to visit. So, among them [the organizations], is the FPI. So, I came in response [to the invitation]. Imagine if we only interact with those who share the same view as ours. We need a leadership that is able to unite, to connect with all groups with different views, as well as with everyone [...] every citizen of Jakarta. If you communicate, exchange ideas [with others of different views], Jakarta will see its people interacting constructively.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/17/anies-baswedan-public-participation-key-developing-jakarta.html,,2017
"Tue, January 17 2017",Prosecutors to present more remarks by Ahok,"Prosecutors are set on Tuesday to present witnesses to testify about more allegedly blasphemous remarks made by Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama. Fifi Lety Indra, a lawyer representing Ahok, said prosecutors had announced that they would resummon Bogor Islamic Forum secretary Willyudin Abdul Rasyid who previously reported the governor for alleged blasphemy in a speech he made in Tegallega, Bogor, on Sept. 6. The court had earlier rejected the possibility of Willyudin providing testimony as it is examining the speech Ahok gave in Thousand Islands regency on Sept. 27. “Prosecutors have prepared six witnesses, but their examination will depend on the judges. Judges usually only examine four or five witnesses in one hearing,” Fifi told The Jakarta Post on Monday. The other witnesses — Muhammad Asroi Saputra, Iman Sudirman and Ibnu Baskoro — who earlier reported Ahok for his Thousand Islands speech, will also testify. On Jan. 10, presiding judge Dwiarso Budi Santiarto adjourned the hearing after Ahok’s lawyers criticized the validity of Willyuddin’s police report against Ahok. During the hearing, defense lawyers revealed that Willyudin reported Ahok to the police on Oct. 7 for his speech in Tegallega. The lawyers said the report was suspicious given that Ahok was now being tried for his statement about a Quranic verse made during a working visit to Thousand Islands. Dwiarso then ordered the prosecutors to bring the Bogor police officers who were in charge of filing Willyudin’s report. “To verify [Willyudin’s] report, we order prosecutors to present the police officers,” Dwiarso said before postponing the hearing. Earlier hearings saw prosecutors presenting witnesses who had reported Ahok for the Thousand Islands speech. On Jan. 3, prosecutors summoned another four witnesses namely Islam Defenders Front (FPI) Jakarta chapter secretary Novel Bamukmin, Sharia Advocate chairman Gus Joy Setiawan, FPI Jakarta head Muchsin and Antiblasphemy Forum head Syamsu Hilal. The four all reported Ahok to the police after watching a video of Ahok’s speech, in which he commented on Surah Al Maidah 51 on Sept. 27. Although the total length of the video is 1 hour and 48 minutes, the witnesses said that they had only focused on the shortened version of the video, in which Ahok’s comments on the Quranic verse run for about 13 seconds. They said the shorter video clearly showed that Ahok’s statement was blasphemous. Fifi said the defense team had prepared several witnesses, namely Juhri, Ferry Lukmantara, Suyanto, Fajrun and Analta Amir. She said Juhri, Ferry, Suyanto and Fajrun had witnessed the way in which several politicians had tried to deter voters from supporting Ahok in the 2007 East Belitung regional election by using Surah Al Maidah 51. Fifi added that Analta was Ahok’s Muslim godbrother. She added that defense lawyers did not plan to summon Sheikh Amr al-Wardani, a Quranic interpretation expert from the internationally respected Al-Azhar University in Cairo. Back in November, it was reported that Ahok’s lawyers would summon Sheikh to testify for Ahok in the case screening. However, the expert was unable to come to the case screening due to family matters.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/17/prosecutors-present-more-remarks-ahok.html,,2017
"Tue, January 17 2017",Island focus: FPI spokesman reported to police,"A group of interfaith figures in Bali have filed a report to the Bali Police on Monday against Munarman, the spokesman of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), for allegedly insulting pecalang, traditional Balinese security guards, amid concerns that his comments could create unrest on the famous resort Island. Local Muslim resident Zet Hasan filed the report, representing the group that comprises several civil society and religious-based groups. The group protested against Munarman’s comment, allegedly made to Kompas in June last year, when he contrasted media scrutiny of the FPI with a lack of reporting on pecalang who, he claimed, threw things at the houses of Muslims and also prevented them from performing Friday prayers in Bali. The statement was recorded in a video that was later uploaded on YouTube. “We reported him because his [alleged] conduct is a threat to Indonesian unity,” I Gusti Ngurah Harta, a prominent Balinese figure said. “If we don’t take action, if we keep silent, it means that it is true. The fact is that it is not true. Rather, pecalang help safeguard Muslims when they perform their prayers.” Imam Bukhori from GP Ansor, the youth wing of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), also rejected Munarman’s statement saying that Muslims and Balinese Hindus as well as pecalang always worked together in safeguarding religious activities in Bali like Muslim prayers and Christmas. Bali Police spokesman, Adj. Sr. Comr. Hengky Widjaja said the police would investigate the case. “We have received the official report and the evidence, which is a video that was uploaded to Youtube,” he said, adding that the police might charge Munarman with hate speech and would summon him for questioning.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/17/island-focus-fpi-spokesman-reported-police.html,,2017
"Wed, January 18 2017",Police defend offi cer who is patron of mass organization,"The National Police have defended West Java Police Chief Insp. Gen. Anton Charliyan against the allegations that his involvement in a local mass organization had undermined his professionalism. The police, again, have been in the spotlight as they struggle to rein in the influence of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), a fringe organization that seems to have become more assertive in pushing its agenda after it helped organize two large rallies late last year. The FPI, which was once accused of being an “attack dog” for the police and intelligence community, has now accused the force of backing an organization called the Indonesian Grassroots Movement (GMBI), in which Anton served as a patron. Anton’s involvement has been seen as problematic as GMBI members and FPI members clashed after the questioning of FPI leader Rizieq Shihab by the West Java Police last week over allegations that he had insulted the state ideology of Pancasila. Following the clash, a rumor spread on social media that an FPI member had been stabbed at a restaurant on Jl. Soekarno-Hatta in Bandung. Anton has denied the rumor and said the police had looked into it, finding no evidence of such an incident. However, the conflict heated up when unidentified men torched the GMBI’s headquarters in Bogor regency on Friday, an incident the West Java police suspected involved the FPI after the force apprehended 20 arson suspects. On Tuesday, National Police spokesperson Insp. Gen. Boy Rafli Amar said police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian had given Anton permission to become a patron of GMBI, asserting that Anton did not violate any laws. “Becoming a supervisor is not the same as being a member. It is more about providing direction and advice. What’s important is that the activities of the related mass organizations are not contradicting Pancasila,” he said. Boy added that supervising mass organizations was part of the police’s duty to raise public awareness on the importance of being law-abiding citizens. But critics argue that the police were jeopardizing their professionalism by getting directly involved in the supervision of mass organizations, which they say could easily evolve into vigilante groups like the FPI, which was once believed to have been backed by powerful elites. Police personnel should not be taking the role of patron for mass organizations since it could endanger their professionalism as law enforcers, an activist from the Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence (Kontras), Feri Kusuma, said. “Mass organizations may act as they please because they think they have the backing of the law enforcers every time they have to face the legal process,” Feri said. Meanwhile, Democratic party lawmaker Benny K. Harman said the police should not back an organization just to fight the FPI, adding that such a move would only exacerbate conflicts. “Our law enforcement institution, [particularly] the National Police is seen as rather weak in facing radical mass organizations [...] however, why should the police supervise this group to fight the FPI? Why not directly punish [them] if they violate laws?,” Benny said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/18/police-defend-offi-cer-who-patron-mass-organization.html,,2017
"Thu, January 19 2017","Govt, MUI cooperate to ease sectarian tensions","As rallies by hard-line Muslim groups intensify, the government and the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) agreed on Wednesday to strengthen ties with Islamic groups to prevent violence. The pledge was made after the MUI advisory board initiated a dialogue between 40 representatives of various Islamic groups, which was also attended by Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Wiranto, who represented President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo. In the dialogue, MUI advisory board chairman Din Syamsuddin said the government needed to listen more to Muslims, particularly when they suffered injustice and economic deprivation. “Hopes are high that this partnership can be built in a mutual manner,” Din said. Amid the simmering political tension arising late last year as a result of the upcoming Jakarta gubernatorial election, conservative Muslim groups, led by the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), held a string of rallies demanding the prosecution of incumbent Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama for allegedly making blasphemous comments about the Quran. Rather than calming Muslims, the MUI has issued a number of edicts that have incited further bellicose acts by the groups, including one alleging that Ahok indeed committed blasphemy. Another edict, which was issued only two weeks before Christmas, instructed Muslims not to wear the attributes of other religions, specifically Santa hats, led to unlawful raids by the FPI on seven shopping centers in the city of Surabaya, East Java. However, the MUI later urged its followers not to use the edict as a basis for conducting illegal raids. Din promised to open further dialogue with various stakeholders in the country to seek peaceful resolutions to various challenges in the country. Wiranto stressed that the government was seeking to protect democracy while at the same time ensuring that the law was upheld equally across the country. “The government is currently taking legal measures, but, rest assured they will not lead to authoritarianism,” he said. “The MUI is our partner; therefore [we expect] its involvement in developing the country, improving the people’s welfare and ensuring stability.” President Jokowi stepped up dialogue with various groups to bring him closer to Muslim communities in the country following a massive anti-Ahok rally last November that descended into violence. His efforts ensured that the second rally, held a month later involving bigger crowds, passed off peacefully. However, Jokowi has never met with protesters from conservative Islamic organizations that were involved in the rally, such as the National Movement to Safeguard the Indonesian Ulema Council’s Fatwa (GNPF-MUI). MUI advisory board deputy chairman Nasaruddin Umar, a progressive Muslim thinker and the Grand imam of Jakarta’s Istiqlal Mosque, called for introspection from everyone, underlining that dialogue was the perfect tool to embrace differences peacefully. Violence broke out last week between sympathizers of the FPI and members of the Indonesian General Society Movement (GMBI) following the questioning of FPI leader Rizieq Shihab by West Java Police over alleged defamation of a state symbol. On Monday, hundreds of FPI members flocked to the National Police headquarters on Jl. Trunojoyo in South Jakarta to demand the dismissal of West Java Police chief Insp. Gen. Anton Charliyan, accusing Anton and the force of taking sides in handling the clash. The police, who arrested 20 people, all reportedly FPI members, after the clash, dismissed the FPI’s accusations, saying that the force had treated everyone equally in mediating the dispute. Various questions, ranging from how the government should settle the recent FPI-GMBI spat to how to counter communism, were raised by the participants in Wednesday’s meeting, causing the dialogue to run longer than expected. A participant in the dialogue, Jawahir Thontowi, legal expert at the Indonesia Islamic University (UII) in Yogyakarta, told Wiranto that the government needed to provide equal protection for ulemas.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/19/govt-mui-cooperate-ease-sectarian-tensions.html,,2017
"Fri, January 20 2017","NU, Muhammadiyah seen as losing their influence","The two major rallies led by hard-line Islamic groups in Jakarta late last year reflected the declining influence of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah, the nation’s largest Islamic organizations, among Indonesian Muslims, analysts say. The face of Indonesian Islam has changed with the rise of hard-line groups like the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), which spearheaded the rallies on Nov. 4 and Dec. 2 that saw hundreds of thousands of Muslims fill the streets of Jakarta to demand the prosecution of the city’s governor, alleging he had committed blasphemy. “NU and Muhammadiyah are still seen as influential organizations in the fields of education and health care, but they are no longer seen as the main reference for religious issues,” Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) researcher Ahmad Najib Burhani said during a discussion organized by the Maarif Institute at Muhammadiyah’s headquarters in Yogyakarta on Thursday. The two organizations had failed to dissuade their followers from taking part in the sectarian rallies against Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, who has been accused of insulting the Quran, Ahmad said. Instead, NU and Muhammadiyah followers listened to the calls made by other Islamic groups, including the FPI, he added. The fact that members of the two organizations, who have long been touted by foreign observers as the face of moderate Islam in Indonesia, lend their support to groups like the FPI and its ilk has been seen as alarming. The rallies came following intense campaigns by the FPI against Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent, who is seeking a new term through the Feb. 15 gubernatorial election. Ahok had topped many surveys before he was charged with blasphemy, which he said had been orchestrated by his enemies to block his election bid. The allegations stemmed from a comment he made during a visit to the Thousand Islands regency in September when he criticized people he said had abused a Quranic verse to prevent Muslims from electing a non-Muslim. Ahok, who is now standing trial at the North Jakarta District Court, insisted that he did not commit blasphemy against Islam. “The ‘Defend Islam’ rallies should be used as a yardstick to decide whether or not one has a moderate view of religion,” Ahmad said. He argued that he had seen a trend in which Muhammadiyah and NU followers had become less moderate and more intolerant. A few years ago, he said, NU members took part in expelling minority Shia followers from Sampang, Madura. While the high-level members of Muhammadiyah championed pluralism, its grassroots members did not, he added. The landscape of Indonesian Islam is definitely changing, Iqbal Ahnaf of the Center for Religious and Cross Cultural Studies at Gadjah Mada University said, adding that the government should quickly address the issue. Muhammadiyah executive Zuly Qodir admitted that his organization had lost its clout in the political sphere and that the hard-line groups were filling the void. As a result, it had been slow in responding to national issues and the actions of political leaders, he said. It is hard to determine the exact number of NU and Muhammadiyah followers in the country, but the organizations often claim to have about 70 million and 40 million, respectively.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/20/nu-muhammadiyah-seen-losing-their-influence.html,,2017
"Sat, January 21 2017",National scene: FPI leader’s fate to be decided next week,"The police have said they will make a decision over the status of Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab in relation to a case pertaining to his alleged insult toward State ideology Pancasila after conducting a second case screening. “We will conduct the screening next week,” Yusri, an investigator with the West Java Police’s general crimes directorate, was quoted as saying by kompas.com on Thursday. “From the second case screening, we will be able to decide Rizieq’s status sometime next week.” The West Java Police held the first screening on Tuesday, after which it was decided that more witnesses needed to be questioned to make a decision in the case, Yusri said. The police have stepped up their investigation into Rizieq from a preliminary investigation to a full investigation. Normally, a person implicated in an alleged crime is named a suspect as the investigation process proceeds from a preliminary to full investigation. However, in Rizieq’s case, it appears investigators are being careful because the case has attracted wide public attention. “If he is found to have violated articles 154 and 320 of the Criminal Code, we will name him a suspect,” Yusri said. Article 154 covers insulting a State symbol and carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison. Article 320 covers defaming a dead person and carries a maximum penalty of four months in jail.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/21/national-scene-fpi-leader-s-fate-be-decided-next-week.html,,2017
"Sat, January 21 2017",Govt brushes off calls to disband vigilante groups,"Say no more: Activists with the Dayak People’s Forum of Central Kalimantan and other organizations stage a protest at the Besar traffic circle in Palangkarya, Central Kalimantan, on Friday to urge the government to disband the Islam Defenders Front (FPI).(Antara/Ronny NT) Calls are again mounting for the government to disband mass organizations considered to have orientations opposed to the state ideology of Pancasila, amid concerns about the growing influence of intolerant groups in the country. But Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Wiranto promised on Friday that the government would not act hastily in disbanding any organization and would seek to strike a balance between freedom of assembly and law enforcement against violent groups. “The government will continue to take legal action, but, rest assured, we will not turn authoritarian,” he said. He played down the growing calls for the government to crackdown on vigilante mass organizations, saying that such actions would require making an amendment to the 2013 Mass Organizations Law, which contained many important elements that needed to be weighed up against each other. The law bans any group from, among other things, inciting hatred, committing blasphemous or violent acts and disrupting public order and national stability, such as promoting separatism. However, it does not contain any articles that clearly define what makes an organization anti-Pancasila. Law and Human Rights Minister Yasonna Hamonangan Laoly has proposed that groups that promote radicalism be considered as anti-Pancasila, highlighting the fact that the current legislation only mentions Marxism and Leninism as contradictory to Pancasila values. “We will expand the definition of anti-Pancasila in the revision [of the Mass Organization Law] because groups that are violent and destructive to the nation are clearly violating Pancasila.” But some lawmakers have rejected the proposal, accusing the minister of trying to disband the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), a notorious hard-line group many consider to be anti-Pancasila. Lukman Edy, a politician from the National Awakening Party (PKB), argued that the FPI was a pro-Pancasila group because it cited Pancasila in its internal regulations. “Therefore, the FPI is not anti-Pancasila, but organizations such as HTI [Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia] are, “Lukman said. “HTI does not mention anything about Pancasila as well as the 1945 Constitution in its own constitution,” he added. House of Representatives Deputy Speaker Fahri Hamzah also criticized Yasonna’s proposal, saying that disbanding the FPI was not the answer as the problem was weak law enforcement. President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, through presidential chief of staff Teten Masduki, has ordered firm law enforcement against intolerant groups. Upholding the law equally may deter vigilante groups, but clear rules are also essential to ensure the law can be upheld equally, particularly due to the failure of law enforcement in handling such violence or religion-driven incidents in the past, said anthropologist Yando Zakaria. The Blasphemy Law, he said, is an example of an ambiguous legal guideline that was seemingly often used as the legal basis to discriminate against minorities in the country. “Freedom of association is recognized by our Constitution. It is [violent] actions that need [stern] law enforcement which is implemented based on clear rules of the game,” Yando said. In the past few months, Jokowi has been ramping up soft approaches, encouraging people to implement Pancasila principles in their daily lives as a way of countering growing intolerance, particularly against the backdrop of two recent massive Muslim protests against blasphemy. His administration recently considered the formation of a presidential working unit to instill Pancasila values in the diverse nation, the latest addition to two other similar programs: Revolusi Mental (mental revolution) and Bela Negara (voluntary state defense training). No details have been revealed yet on the planned Pancasila working unit, which was initiated by Coordinating Maritime Affairs Minister Luhut Pandjaitan.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/21/govt-brushes-calls-disband-vigilante-groups.html,,2017
"Mon, January 23 2017","Sectarian rallies could snowball, say experts","Large Muslim organizations should pay attention to the growing popularity of sectarian rallies incited by hard-line groups in recent months, experts say. Huge rallies held recently by conservative Muslims in Jakarta may continue to attract followers, indicating a failure by the government and Muslim organizations such as Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah to address inherent problems in society. “The rising action to defend Islam is a response to a social crisis that has caused anxiety among different classes in society. The middle class has its own socioeconomic problems, such as unemployment, and the Muslim upper class was losing to others,” Airlangga Pribadi Usman, a political and Islamic analyst from Surabaya’s Airlangga University, said during a discussion held by the Maarif Institute last week. He warned that the rising trend for religious conservatism could lead to a setback in tolerance in the country, as it would diminish the empowerment of minority groups and spark prejudice among religious groups. Organized by the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and other conservative groups, huge rallies occurred in the capital and cities countrywide demanding the prosecution of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian of Chinese descent. The groups claimed that remarks Ahok made during a speech in Thousands Islands regency had insulted the Quran. The governor, who is seeking reelection next month, faces tough competition against candidates Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono, the first son of former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, and Anies Baswedan, a former education minister. The former running mate of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo in the previous Jakarta election, Ahok has again received support from the President and his political party the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P). Airlangga said some members of the political elite who opposed the government had taken advantage of the discontent among certain groups. The opposing factions, he said, used Islamic hard-line groups to fight against the government for the sake of their own economic and political interests. On the other hand, Islamic organizations known to be moderate and progressive, like NU and Muhammadiyah, have failed to find solutions to the injustice. “[The conservative groups] use popular jargon [about] race and religion, which is actually not the answer to all the problems that are later [...] believed by many Muslims. The small problems of the middle class are defined as problems of all Muslims.” He said the government and society should take action to minimize the spread of radical religious ideas dividing the country. “The ideas of tolerance and pluralism cannot be developed without improvements in social justice.” Muhammad Wildan from Sunan Kalijaga Islamic University in Yogyakarta said the sectarian rallies could draw more followers due to widespread media coverage, and that most of those who participated in the rallies had a limited knowledge of Islam. They had only learned about religion by watching television, he said. “Most of them only followed others without understanding the substance of the issue,” he said. Some of those people, he added, had even only attended the rallies to take pictures. Mark Woodward from Arizona State University said NU and Muhammadiyah should take action in response to the growth of hard-line groups, especially after the recent rallies. He said although the FPI was a small organization, it could have a big impact, adding that it reminded him of the radical and violent Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in the US. He queried whether people were afraid of the FPI or felt terrorized by its presence and thus chose to remain silent. “If yes, then the FPI is an organization that could disturb democracy.”",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/23/sectarian-rallies-could-snowball-say-experts.html,,2017
"Tue, January 24 2017",National scene: Govt should punish violent groups,"The government has been urged to strictly enforce the law when dealing with members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and other mass organizations instead of merely disbanding them, an act that could be regarded as anti-democratic. Sociologist Vedi R. Hadiz from the University of Melbourne told a discussion in Jakarta on Monday that the growing intolerance pushed by groups such as the FPI was the result of years of omission by the state. “Intolerant groups can continue to engage in their violent actions because there is a part of the state apparatus that preserves them. Do we see any of these groups that attack minority groups such as the Ahmadiyah, for example, being held accountable for their actions?” Vedi asked. Vedi encouraged law enforcers to punish any organization that disturbed the peace and public order. However, Vedi also argued that disbanding intolerant groups was anti-democratic. Discussions on how to best discipline disruptive mass organizations have arisen once again after the FPI attracted public attention for mobilizing mass demonstrations calling for the imprisonment of incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian of ethnic Chinese descent, for alleged blasphemy. To crack down on the amplifying violence that is spreading across Indonesia, the government is planning to revise the prevailing Law No. 17/2013 on mass organizations to expand the definition of anti-Pancasila in order to include more categories of groups that could be banned from operating in the country.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/24/national-scene-govt-should-punish-violent-groups.html,,2017
"Tue, January 24 2017",FPI chief faces hate charges over banknote comment,"The first questioning session of Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab over hate speech allegations brought parts of the city’s downtown to a halt on Monday as hundreds of FPI members staged a rally to “oversee” the questioning at the Jakarta Police headquarters. The protesters, who called on the police “not to criminalize an ulema like Rizieq”, started to pack the busy Jl. Sudirman in South Jakarta at around 10 a.m. They had gathered since dawn at the Al Azhar Mosque, and started to walk all the way to the headquarters at 9 a.m. after performing Dhuha morning prayers at the mosque. The crowd in front of the headquarters forced police officers to close the slow lane of Jl. Sudirman, forcing motorcyclists into the fast lane normally reserved for four-wheel vehicles. Rizieq arrived at the headquarters at around 11 a.m. and immediately rushed to the police’s special crimes directorate, where his questioning took place. The leader of the hard-line group was questioned regarding a speech that went viral on social media, in which he allegedly claimed the latest design of the country’s banknotes contained the logo of the defunct Indonesian Communism Party (PKI). Communism is banned in Indonesia. In the three-minute video, Rizieq showed his congregation a number of the country’s newest banknotes and pointed out a symbol on the banknotes that he claimed resembled the communist hammer and sickle symbol. “[By seeing the symbol] I wonder whether this country is a communist country or a Pancasila [the national ideology] state,” Rizieq said in the video. After the questioning, the firebrand preacher said he had brought samples of all the newly issued bills, ranging fromRp 1,000 (7 US cents) to Rp 100,000 bills, and claimed to investigators that all of them contained the PKI logo. “I told investigators I did not make up the claim [that the notes contained the hammer and sickle logo]. I gave them all the bills so we can prove it.” Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Raden Prabowo Argo Yuwono told reporters that the police had yet to charge the FPI leader, and his status was still that of a witness. He faces hate speech charges as stipulated in the 2016 Electronic Information and Transactions (ITE) Law, he said. Rizieq was reported on Jan. 8 by the Young Intellectuals Anti-Slander Network (Jimaf), who said the FPI leader’s statement amounted to hate speech because it was a baseless claim that could incite unrest. Bank Indonesia (BI) Governor Agus Martowardojo previously rebutted Rizieq’s claim, saying that the symbol in question was actually the central bank’s logo printed using an anti-counterfeit method. Separately in Manado, North Sulawesi, hundreds of students incorporated in the North Sulawesi Muslim Students Forum staged a rally at the regional office of the Religious Affairs Ministry demanding the dissolution of radical community organizations in the country, including the FPI. — Evangline Aruperes contributed to this story from Manado.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/24/fpi-chief-faces-hate-charges-over-banknote-comment.html,,2017
"Wed, January 25 2017",More voters looking at candidates’ religious backgrounds,"On the heels of a controversial remark attributed to Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, religious sentiments have escalated among voters in the capital, with many thinking that they should vote for a leader according to religion, a survey says. A recent survey of 880 respondents carried out by the Indonesian Survey Circle (LSI) found a significant increase of people in Jakarta who believe that religion should be taken into consideration when choosing a leader, growing from 40 percent in April last year to 71.4 percent this month. The survey said a significant increase of voters adhering to such a principle was sparked in September when Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent who is seeking to hold onto the governor’s position he inherited from Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, made a statement afterwards deemed controversial because he cited a Quranic verse during a speech in Thousand Islands regency. It was an incident that ignited a nationwide uproar among conservative Muslims and led to a string of sectarian rallies demanding his prosecution for blasphemy. “Three rallies against Ahok and the ongoing criminal case are playing a fundamental role in increasing religious sentiments among voters. This number can still go higher in the future,” LSI researcher Adrian Sopa told reporters on Tuesday. It was governor candidate Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono who has benefited most from the increasing religious sentiments, according to the survey, as various polls now place him as frontrunner ahead of Ahok and former education minister Anies Baswedan. Before September, Ahok was considered the frontrunner in the race, compared to neophyte Agus, who quit his military career for the election, and Anies, who has just been ousted from President Jokowi’s Cabinet. Questions have been raised over whether Agus’ father, former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, was the one who orchestrated the protests, but Yudhoyono had strongly denied the accusations. Adrian said that majority of the respondents believe Agus has the strongest ability to maintain religious harmony in Jakarta. With his military background, Agus is considered an individual who would uphold the nation’s unity and diversity and he is associated with the nationalist-religious part of the political spectrum. Ahok, meanwhile, has found himself on shaky ground since the blasphemy controversy broke as respondents believed that he was the candidate who has the least empathy for religious issues and, therefore, they doubted he would be the right leader to maintain diversity. “On the other hand, Anies has a good track record with religion diversity, but he has his own issues,” Adrian said. Only 28.5 percent of Muslim voters who believe Ahok had committed blasphemy would vote for Anies, while Agus enjoyed 47.2 percent of this group. The survey found that many still considered Anies a Shia or liberal Muslim. His recent visit to the headquarters of the radical Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) was also considered an example of his inability to uphold diversity. Anies defended himself by saying that his visit to the FPI leaders was aimed at refuting rumors surrounding his religious identity that might have disadvantaged him in the election. Anies, of all people, knows exactly that he needs Muslim voters as various polls place him at the last position with just weeks before voting day. Despite the Regional Elections Law barring political campaigners from visiting prayer areas and schools, the former minister has gone to mosques and Islamic boarding schools, apparently to win the Muslim hearts. “I know we cannot campaign in a mosque so I only ask you to pray that I can be a trustworthy person,” Anies said during his visit to Al-Azhar Mosque on Jan. 15.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/25/more-voters-looking-candidates-religious-backgrounds.html,,2017
"Fri, January 27 2017",Regulating religious intolerance,"There is no doubt that Indonesia’s Muslim leanings have shifted to a more intolerant state from where they were 10 years ago. One needs only to see the recent turmoil to understand the gravity of this shift: the explicit acceptance of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), the massive turnout at the divisive 4/11 and 2/12 rallies last year and the support by many for FPI leader Rizieq Shihab’s aggressive and demeaning description of Christians is a small sample of many indications. But one needs to understand that this is not a big-bang phenomenon. Indonesia’s growing intolerance has been brewing for longer than one would want to recognize. We may recount that in 2008, the FPI burned down houses of Ahmadiyah followers, in 2009, the Bekasi government closed the HKBP Filadelfia church, in 2010, the Bogor government defied the Supreme Court’s decision to allow the establishment of the GKI Yasmin church and in 2012 Shia Muslims in Sampang, Madura, were relocated by force. According to data from the National Violence Monitoring System (NVMS), there has been a constant upward trend of inter- and intra-religious conflict, starting as far back as 2004 (four cases in 2004, 27 in 2008, 101 in 2011 and 257 in 2014), most of which involved Muslims. Undoubtedly, the politicization of divisive religious sentiment by opportunistic politicians and the lack of interfaith dialogue have significantly contributed to this shift. However, one needs to understand that such variables are only agent-variables incentivized to increase intolerance by a permissive system; and it is this system that lacks public scrutiny. A key component of the system that bears responsibility for engineering a suitable climate for the fermentation of religious intolerance is the obsolete Blasphemy Law No. 1 of 1965, as well as Article 156a of the Criminal Code. This Blasphemy Law is at the center of Indonesia’s rising religious intolerance, as it is a primary cog that has habituated a sense of intolerant religious entitlement. The core problem of this law lies in the fact that blasphemy has never been clearly defined. In theory, the law allows anyone to criminalize others for anything he or she subjectively perceives as blasphemous based on his or her religion. In practice, courts will refer to prominent religious bodies like the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), which are supposed to be less subjective and fairer but turn out to lack public trust, hold the monopoly over Islamic interpretations and are biased toward the majority. It is no wonder that at least 49 of the 73 blasphemy cases heard in courts since 1968 concerned sects and critical assessments of religion that have no intention to be blasphemous. As a result of this vagueness, the socio-religious culture that is bred is a culture of subjective imposition giving majority religions the right to impose their will according to what they subjectively believe is right and prosecute what they subjectively believe is wrong. Discussions on whether or not such rights exist and how far they extend are subverted due to the fact that the existence and vagueness of the Blasphemy Law in effect already implies that such rights do exist and that their extent is endless. Though an important discussion on this matter did occur and was left open with the decision of the law’s judicial review in 2010 (the Constitutional Court voted to preserve the law but commented that “changes” needed to be made), nobody followed through. It is this culture of rightful subjective imposition that, through the massive mobilization and politicization accompanying these trials, has been pervasively internalized and left unchecked within Indonesian religious cleavages. We should not forget that such mobilization and politicization has occurred frequently in these trials for a long time, be it regionally (i.e. mobilization by hard-line group FUI and politicization by Noer Tjahja in the Shia Sampang case) or nationally (i.e. mobilization by the FPI and the MUI along with the politicization by key politicians in the case of suspended Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama). As a result, religious communities are habituated to feel entitled over the absolution of their religious right; that there is no need for moderation and limitation. What this manifests in is the intolerant state of religion we see today: Mere commentary and criticism of alleged abuse of religious teachings is labeled as blasphemous and thus responded to by angry mobs. Such commentary or acts are not moderated to respect others. To solve the problem of Indonesia’s intolerance we need to depoliticize religious sentiment and further discuss how religion should fit into Indonesia’s democracy, but before any of that can happen we need to scrutinize the permissive system that fuels a socio-religious culture that justifies these problems to begin with. We need to take a hard look at our Blasphemy Law and discuss whether, as a society, we want to have a law that allows the imposition of a majority’s subjective religious right at the expense of others’ basic rights with little or no limitation, and a society whose culture of rightful subjective imposition is unchallenged and unmoderated. Hopefully, the answer is no. __________________________ The writer is an assistant researcher at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Jakarta.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/27/regulating-religious-intolerance.html,,2017
"Fri, January 27 2017",Accusing one another of blasphemy is now the norm,"University of Indonesia (UI) lecturer Ade Armando said he was baffled as to why he was charged with hate speech over a comment that he made on Facebook and Twitter almost two years ago. On May 20, 2015, Ade wrote on his social media accounts that the Quran could be read in various styles as “God is not an Arab”. He was teasing a group of Muslims who criticized the State Palace for reciting the Quran to a Javanese melody during an event to commemorate the birth of Prophet Muhammad. “I think it’s very clear that what I wrote is not blasphemous, and it does not spark hatred in society, even though that is what I have been charged with,” said Ade, who was initially reported for blasphemy but is now being charged with spreading hate. Ade was reported to the police by Johan Khan on May 23, 2015. Ade said he did know who Johan was, but Johan had repeatedly demanded that Ade apologize for his statements. On Wednesday, Ade was notified that he had been charged with violating the Electronic Information and Transactions (ITE) Law, which criminalizes online defamation and hate speech. More and more people have been reported for or charged with blasphemy, defamation or hate speech. The Institute for Criminal Justice Reform (ICJR) recorded at least 708 online defamation and hate speech cases in 2016, though only 166 were settled by the police. The trend followed the police’s controversial decision to charge Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama with blasphemy after hundreds of thousands of Muslims in Jakarta demanded that he be prosecuted for allegedly insulting the Quran. Ahok’s case seems to have triggered a snowball effect. Recently, Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) chairwoman Megawati Soekarnoputri was reported for alleged blasphemy over a speech she made during the party’s 44th anniversary. Megawati, whose party backed Ahok’s bid in the gubernatorial election, said that the country must be wary of groups with “closed ideologies” that “claim to predict the future, including life after death, even though they have not seen it themselves”. The report against Megawati was filed by the spokesperson of the Alliance of the Nation for Anti-Religious Blasphemy, Baharuzaman, who also happened to be a former chairman of the North Jakarta chapter of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). FPI leader Rizieq Shihab, who has been the loudest advocate for pushing the blasphemy charges against Ahok, has been reported to the police for allegedly insulting Pancasila, spreading hate speech and insulting Christianity. The legal process against Ahok encouraged people to use laws to attack their enemies, said ICJR executive director Supriyadi Widodo Eddyono. The insult provisions in the 1965 Blasphemy Law, the ITE Law and the Criminal Code are too vague, making it easy for people to accuse other people of crimes, he explained. “People can easily file reports because the laws are vague. Such laws allow people to report each other to the police.” He said the police have been overwhelmed with investigating public reports on these matters and that cases are getting out of hand. “Police investigators should be able to investigate real crimes, such as corruption and drug trafficking, rather than being burdened by investigating insults,” he said. Meanwhile, UI law expert Ganjar Laksmana said the insult reports show a gap between people’s legal awareness and demands for performance improvement in law enforcement agencies. This shows a setback of public perception of law; instead of seeing criminal law as an instrument to protect order, people use it as a tool to go against other people who they do not like, Ganjar said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/27/accusing-one-another-blasphemy-now-norm.html,,2017
"Tue, January 31 2017",Firebrand cleric Rizieq named suspect for insulting Pancasila,"The police named on Monday Rizieq Shihab, a hard-line Islamist leader who has orchestrated a string of sectarian rallies over the past few months, a suspect for allegedly insulting the state ideology and defaming the country’s founding president. The chairman of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) was charged for a sermon in which he accused Sukarno of creating a false interpretation of Pancasila. Sukmawati Soekarnoputri, one of Sukarno’s daughters and the younger sister of Megawati Soekarnoputri, the matriarch of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), reported Rizieq to the police in October. Before he was named a suspect, Rizieq led the FPI to hold rallies at the headquarters of the West Java Police to put pressure on West Java Police chief Insp. Gen. Anton Charliyan. The FPI condemned Anton for being an advisor to a mass organization called the Indonesian General Society Movement (GMBI). The West Java Police are in charge of the investigation into Rizieq. “Based on witnesses against Rizieq Shihab, we have raised his status to suspect,” West Java Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Yusri Yunus said at the headquarters of the West Java Police in Bandung. Rizieq is alleged to have violated Article 154a of the Criminal Code (KUHP) on insulting state symbols. The article carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison. He is also alleged to have violated Article 320 on defaming a dead person, which carries a maximum penalty of four months in jail. Yusri added that Rizieq had been named a suspect after the police conducted a third case screening that was done to gather more evidence against the Muslim cleric. Sukmawati reported Rizieq after the controversial sermon went viral. The video was uploaded three years ago but Sukmawati only found out about it in June. In the video, Rizieq said there was a difference between Sukarno’s version of Pancasila and the one written in the Jakarta Charter. “In Sukarno’s Pancasila, faith in God is placed in the ass, but in the Jakarta Charter’s Pancasila, faith in God is placed in the head. Which one is better? Sukarno’s or the Jakarta Charter?” Rizieq said during the two-minute video. Sukmawati said it was inappropriate for Rizieq, the leader of a large mass organization, to insult Pancasila. Rizieq earlier denied he insulted president Sukarno and Pancasila, but admitted that he criticized the founding father in relation to the formulation of Pancasila as the state ideology. The criticisms, he said, were also written down in his master’s degree thesis on Pancasila and sharia. He said he criticized Sukarno, who wanted to move “faith in God” from the first principle to the last, in discussions with the country’s founding fathers in 1945. “What’s in the video was a two-minute excerpt from a two-hour lecture. You should have opposed a thesis with a thesis, not a police report,” he said. Rizieq has come into the spotlight for leading conservative Muslim groups holding rallies demanding the prosecution of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian and a Chinese-Indonesian, for alleged blasphemy. So far, the police are investigating five different cases involving Rizieq. These cases relate to Rizieq’s alleged blasphemy against Christianity, comments over supposed communist symbols on Rupiah bank notes, insults to Pancasila, hate speech and cultural insults. Rizieq was sentenced to prison for fueling hatred in 2003 and 2008. Trapped in this situation, Rizieq has asked for assistance from the National Police to act as mediators between him and those who have filed police reports against him.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/01/31/firebrand-cleric-rizieq-named-suspect-insulting-pancasila.html,,2017
"Thu, February 2 2017",FPI patron dogged by crises — from insulting Pancasila to sex chats,"Female force: Wearing headscarves, policewomen and members of the Women Army Corps guard supporters of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) as they stage a rally outside the Jakarta Police Headquarters on Wednesday. The rally was a show of their support for FPI leader Rizieq Shihab, who was questioned at the police headquarters over alleged treason plot.(JP/Dhoni Setiawan) Two months ago, Rizieq Shihab, 51, the prominent leader of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), was over the moon. He led a group of clerics to mobilize conservative and moderate Muslims to stage two large rallies that turned out to be the biggest public mobilization since the lead-up to the Reform Era in 1998. The rallies were initially aimed at protesting Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja “Ahok” Purnama for allegedly insulting the Quran, but turned ugly after indications that they were being used as attempts to overthrow the legitimate government. After many hailed Rizieq as being a “grand imam” for his perceived success in uniting Muslim communities as demonstrated in the rallies, his rise to prominence, however, was short lived. Since a couple of weeks ago, Rizieq, whom his supporters reverently called habib (descendant of Prophet Muhammad) has started to feel the noose tighten around his neck. A dozen or more police reports have been filed against him by many groups across the archipelago, alleging he was guilty of insulting the state ideology Pancasila, inciting hatred by criticizing new rupiah bills, defamation, cultural insults and insulting Christianity. He was also questioned as a witness in regard to treason allegations involving a number of activists accused of planning to exploit the Dec. 2 rally to topple the government. It was not until Monday that Rizieq was finally declared a suspect for allegedly insulting Pancasila and defaming the country’s founding president. But the devastating shot came earlier on Sunday afternoon when Firza Husein, 46, a treason suspect, was exposed as allegedly having an affair with Rizieq. Screen grabs of sex chats via WhatsApp that allegedly took place between her and Rizieq went viral through YouTube and other social media. Firza Husein (left) - Rizieq Shihab (JP/Dhoni Setiawan) A dedicated website, www.baladacintarizieq.com , was set up detailing the affair, but was shut down by the Communications and Information Ministry a day later, while a voice recording purportedly of Firza raving to a friend about her affair with Rizieq remained widely distributed through social media. Rizieq responded on Wednesday by saying the alleged sex chats were an orchestrated attempt to bring his morality into question, were contrived and constituted attempted defamation. “I have been a victim of countless slander attempts, such as claims that I have six wives, I sodomize my followers, I have affairs with girls, I accepted a Rp 100 billion (US$7.51 million) bribe, I insulted Pancasila and so on,” said Rizieq at the Jakarta Police headquarters. “I put the case in the hands of God,” he said. Firza’s family has also denied the allegation, saying the circulating pictures and information were “hoaxes.” But the Jakarta Police have taken the issue seriously after a group calling itself the Student Alliance for Anti-Pornography reported the case to the police on Monday, as it deemed the screen grabs had disrupted public order. The police raided Firza’s house in East Jakarta on Wednesday and confiscated bed sheets, pillows and a television. “This [the raid] is a follow-up to a pornography report,” Jakarta Police special crimes director Sr. Comr. Wahyu Hadiningrat said. He was referring to a webpage featuring explicit photos of a woman resembling Firza that went viral on social media. Jakarta Police spokesperson Sr. Comr. Argo Yuwono said that apart from the pornography case, the raid was also carried out to gather evidence for the treason case. “We are killing two birds with one stone,” he said. Firza was arrested for alleged treason along with 10 activists on Dec. 2, several hours before the start of a large rally to demand the arrest of Ahok, the first Christian of Chinese descent to govern Jakarta, in a blasphemy case. She was later released, but was arrested again by the police on Tuesday for alleged treason, and is currently being detained at the maximum security prison at the National Police’s Mobile Brigade headquarters in Depok, West Java. Firza claims to be the chairwoman of a foundation linked to the family of former dictator Soeharto. However, Hutomo “Tommy” Mandala Putra, Soeharto’s youngest son, recently threatened to sue her for claiming to have a working relationship with the family. Argo said both Rizieq and Firza could be charged under the 2008 Pornography Law if found guilty of producing or spreading pornographic content. Over the years Rizieq has earned notoriety for criminal offenses. In 2003, during the presidency of Megawati Soekarnoputri, he was jailed for eight months for ransacking bars and karaoke parlors in Jakarta. During Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s presidency in 2008, Rizieq was sentenced to 30 months in jail after his followers attacked a group of people in a Pancasila parade. After a hiatus from 2010 and 2011 due to a serious illness, Rizieq resurfaced in 2013, calling Yudhoyono a loser. He then withdrew from the limelight in 2014 and 2015, and resurfaced in 2016 with the rallies. Rizieq and his band of FPI followers were formed in 1998, with its first task given by the Indonesian Military (TNI) to help find a solution to the separatist movement in Aceh, according to media reports at the time.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/02/02/fpi-patron-dogged-crises-insulting-pancasila-sex-chats.html,,2017
"Tue, February 7 2017","Commentary: Thanks to Rizieq, Gen. Tito’s political career to skyrocket","National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian has shown that President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s decision to name him head of the police corps in July 2016 was the right move. Tito succeeded in neutralizing political upheavals and antigovernment rallies, mostly through silent operations. The 53-year-old police chief is now the President’s most effective aide not only on security but also economic and political matters. He may have replaced Coordinating Maritime Affairs Minister Gen. (ret) Luhut Pandjaitan as the President’s security czar and therefore has a great opportunity to go far beyond his current post. Many probably do not realize that Tito has practically become the country’s second-most powerful man after Jokowi, and firebrand Muslim cleric Rizieq Shihab deserves the biggest credit for Tito’s political fortune. Don’t laugh. One day, just before the presidential election in 2019, Tito will be seen visiting Rizieq at the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) headquarters in Petamburan, Central Jakarta, or somewhere else. Tito will hug FPI leader Rizieq and even kiss his cheek, because if not for Rizieq, President Jokowi would not have picked Tito as his running mate in the presidential race. And of course Tito will ask for the cleric’s blessing. Such a scenario of course is based on current political development, which has witnessed Tito emerge as the President’s right hand man who managed to tame opposition and anti-government groups with minimum political risk. “Habib, thank you for all street demonstrations that you led, your [hate] speeches and anti- everything acts. Now I stand a big chance of winning the vice presidential post precisely because of your tireless efforts to destabilize the government and frighten minorities,” Tito, who will be 55 at that time, tells the FPI leader. Born in the South Sumatra capital of Palembang on Oct. 26, 1964, Tito graduated from the Police Academy in 1987. He holds Master degrees from the United Kingdom and New Zealand and a PhD from Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University. He specializes in counterterrorism. But how crucial is Rizieq’s role for Tito’s political future? Rizieq attracted international media attention and received applause from millions of Indonesian Muslims for leading two large rallies against Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama last year. Many of the protesters were angry with the sharp tongue of Ahok, who is now a defendant in a blasphemy case at the North Jakarta District Court. They demanded the heaviest punishment for the Christian governor of Chinese descent for allegedly insulting Islam. In the Nov. 4 demonstration, the government clearly failed to anticipate the impacts of Rizieq’s “people’s power” plan. Many were disappointed with Tito then because he seemed to accommodate the FPI’s demands. The President was clearly clueless about what would really happen that day, because his intelligence aides miscalculated the number of protesters. The rally helped Rizieq transform his image as an intolerant Muslim leader to a national figure, whose influence and power might rival that of leaders of the country’s two largest moderate Muslim organizations, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah. In the following anti-Ahok rally on Dec. 2, however, the government gained the upperhand against Rizieq. The President attended the Friday prayers organized by the FPI at the National Monument (Monas) Square to steal the show from Rizieq. Earlier that morning, the police arrested 11 antigovernment activists, including Rachmawati Soekarnoputri, the sister and nemesis of former president Megawati Soekarnoputri. The 212 rally seemed to be a turning point for Rizieq’s downfall and Tito’s prominence on the other hand. Instead of seizing the moment to morph himself into a widely recognized national leader, he continued his antigovernment movements and tried to find all possible ways to discredit the government, including his demand for the withdrawal of the newly issued rupiah banknotes, which he accused of bearing an image that resembled the now defunct Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) hammer-and-sickle logo. But Rizieq’s biggest blunder is his overconfidence in fighting Jakarta and West Java Police chiefs, who are Tito’s confidantes. The cleric is now facing a string of criminal charges and has been named a suspect for insulting the Pancasila. The police have now linked Rizieq with sexually explicit WhatsApp conversations allegedly between himself and Firza Husein, a treason suspect. Tito clearly is reaping the benefits from Rizieq’s concerted but careless antigovernment acts. The President now has Tito at his side and has let him become powerful under his full control. Trust me, Jokowi has started thinking about the possibility of picking Tito as his running mate for when he seeks reelection in 2019. At the same time, the President will consider his men for strategic posts such as the director general of taxation and head of the Financial Reports and Analysis Centre. The two will form a powerful team to fight tax fraud and corruption while ensuring higher state revenues and most importantly to silence Jokowi’s detractors. For Tito, Rizieq will be inseparable from his rise.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/02/07/commentary-thanks-rizieq-gen-tito-s-political-career-skyrocket.html,,2017

The participants from interfaith and intercultural communities also expressed their wish to disband the Islam Defenders’ Front (FPI). Numerous civil society organizations participated in the parade, such as the Bali chapter of Nahdlatul Ulama’s youth wing Ansor, Balinese martial arts institution Sandhi Murti, the Indonesian Church and Bible Association (PGLII) and Bali’s Hindu-Muslim Brotherhood. The participants also urged President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo to disband other mass organizations that voiced intolerant sentiments. The FPI has been at the center of rising sectarian issues following its involvement in two large-scale protests last year against Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama. A group of interfaith figures last month reported FPI spokesman Munarman for allegedly insulting pecalang (traditional Balinese security guards).",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/02/07/island-focus-cultural-parade-held-promote-diversity.html,,2017
"Thu, February 9 2017",Anti-Ahok rally to go ahead despite police prohibition,"Defying warnings from the police that they will arrest anyone involved in a rally ahead of next week’s regional elections, conservative Muslim groups insist that they will go ahead with a plan to stage rallies in the capital. A number of conservative Islamic groups, such as the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), the Muslim People’s Forum (FUI) and the National Movement to Safeguard the Indonesian Ulema Council’s Fatwa (GNPF-MUI), have claimed that they will hold rallies between Feb. 11 and 15. These groups were also among those that initiated the mass rallies in November and December last year that saw hundreds of thousands of people march on the streets of Jakarta demanding the prosecution of incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama for alleged blasphemy. The General Elections Commission (KPU) has declared Feb. 12 to Feb. 14 to be a cooling-off period before voting day on Feb. 15, meaning that political parties are forbidden from campaigning on those days. The FPI, however, has reiterated its intention to hold a rally. “We want to remind all Indonesian Muslims about Verse 51 of the Surah Al-Maidah in the Quran. This verse prohibits Muslims from voting for a non-Muslim,” FPI spokesperson Slamet Maarif told The Jakarta Post on Wednesday. Ahok, who is running for re-election in the Jakarta gubernatorial election with his running mate Jakarta Deputy Governor Djarot Saiful Hidayat, is a Christian and a Chinese-Indonesian and the only non-Muslim competing in the gubernatorial race. The other two candidate pairs are Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono-Sylviana Murni and Anies Baswedan-Sandiaga Uno, all of whom are Muslims. Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Mochamad Iriawan, who has confirmed that major rallies are slated for Feb. 11, 12 and 15 in Jakarta, has warned people to refrain from engaging in rallies with election-related messages after the official campaign period ends on Feb. 11. “After the end of campaigning, no party will be allowed to hold rallies carrying messages related to the election. All violators of this rule will be charged under the Elections Law, which carries a maximum penalty of three months in jail,” Iriawan said on Tuesday. The police said they had received a letter from the FUI informing them of its intention to rally with around 10,000 others on Jakarta’s streets on Feb. 11. In a move believed by many to have deflated some key figures in conservative Islamic organizations, the police have recently shown off their muscle. FPI leader Rizieq Shihab has been named a suspect by the West Java Police for allegedly insulting the state ideology Pancasila. He is also close to being charged with violating the Pornography Law after allegedly sending and receiving sexually explicit messages with Firza Husein via WhatsApp. Firza is also a suspect for alleged treason. The Bali Police have named FPI secretary-general Munarman a suspect for insulting the traditions of the island’s majority-Hindu population. Meanwhile, GNPF-MUI chairman Bachtiar Nasir has been implicated in a money laundering case related to fund-raising activities ahead of the Dec. 2 rally. Influential Muslim organizations have refused to endorse the rallies. Indonesia’s two-largest Muslim organizations, the Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah, have urged Muslims to refrain from staging rallies. “Let’s take some lessons from the [blasphemy] case and not create new controversies,” NU executive Imam Azis told the Post on Wednesday. The Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) has also expressed a similar view, saying that the public should be concerned with maintaining peace and harmony in the country ahead of the elections. “The MUI has a duty to tell all Indonesian Muslims to remain calm and not get caught up in provocations. It is our shared duty to maintain peace and harmony,” MUI deputy chairman Zainut Tauhid Saadi said at his office last week.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/02/09/anti-ahok-rally-go-ahead-despite-police-prohibition.html,,2017
"Sat, February 11 2017",Police threaten to arrest Rizieq for his defiance,"Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab is facing arrest after failing to answer two police summonses for questioning over allegations he insulted the Pancasila state ideology and defamed founding father Sukarno. The police said Rizieq, who had already been named a suspect in the case, had been uncooperative during the investigation since he never showed up for questioning at the West Java Police headquarters. “We have not received any information from his lawyer. They never responded to our calls,” West Java Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Yusri Yunus said on Friday. The firebrand cleric has been charged under articles 154a and 320 of the Criminal Code (KUHP) on insulting the state ideology and defamation. Rizieq failed to answer the first summons last Tuesday. “We did not receive any response. They did not give us a reason [for why he did not appear for questioning],” said Yusri, who issued the suspect a second summons the following day. Police investigators claimed the summons had been rejected by the recipient upon delivery. “When he was still a witness in the case, he only attended the second questioning session. But after he was named a suspect, he was no longer responsive. We could issue a warrant [to arrest him],” Yusri said. The police have given the suspect or his lawyer until Feb. 10 to answer the summons. However, if their calls go ignored, the police have said they will arrest the FPI leader. Rizieq’s lawyer, Kiagus M. Choiri, only said his client was unable to appear for questioning, refusing to elaborate. “No comment for now,” he said over the phone. Rizieq is not the only FPI leader being investigated by the police. The Bali Police have also charged FPI spokesman Munarman for allegedly defaming pecalang (traditional Balinese security guards). Munarman allegedly said pecalang had attacked Muslims and banned them from carrying out Friday prayers. He has been charged under Article 28 of the Electronic Information and Transactions (ITE) Law on hate speech. Munarman’s lawyer, Ni Made Anggre Astari, filed on Friday a pretrial motion challenging the police’s move to charge her client. “They lodged a pretrial motion this morning,” Denpasar District Court spokesperson Sukereni said on Friday. The police said they would proceed with the case against Munarman despite his legal move. “We have prepared a legal team to appear at the pretrial hearing,” Bali Police special crimes unit head Sr. Comr. Kenedy said. He added that the police may charge more people in the case as video showed Munarman allegedly defaming pecalang was uploaded onto the FPI’s official website. The FPI members who uploaded the video will also be charged, the officer said. The FPI gained notoriety in the past for its vigilante acts, such as raiding liquor stores or restaurants open during the Ramadhan fasting month. The group recently grabbed media attention again after spearheading two major rallies demanding the prosecution of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama on allegations of blasphemy last year. Bachtiar Nasir, another influential figure behind the two anti-Ahok rallies, is under investigation over money laundering allegations. The police have refused to give details on the case. Several Islamist groups have said they plan to hold another major rally in Jakarta on Saturday to protest what they claim to be an attempt by law enforcers to criminalize ulema. Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the two largest Islamic organizations in the country, are not supporting the rally and have asked their followers to not take part.

"Wed, February 22 2017",House bows to pressure over inquiry,"Torrential rain that led to inundation in flood-prone areas across Jakarta since Tuesday morning failed to dampen the spirits of protesters participating in a peaceful rally held to demand the suspension and incarceration of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama for alleged blasphemy. Tuesday’s protest in front of the House of Representatives complex on Jl. Gatot Subroto, South Jakarta, was participated in by fewer people than a similar rally two weeks ago. The rally, which started at 8:30 a.m., ended after lawmakers promised to heed the protesters’ demands by exerting their political rights to demand an explanation from the government. In his speech, Bambang Soesatyo, chairman of House Commission III overseeing law, human rights and security affairs, promised that the House would meet with the President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo administration and discuss the possible suspension of the governor. “We will do two things: deliver the aspirations to the President and [relay the demand to] the National Police,” Bambang said. The protesters demanded that the House pressure the government to suspend Ahok pending the outcome of his blasphemy trial. On the same day, Ahok attended a hearing at the North Jakarta District Court. Support has been escalating at the House for an inquiry into the return of Ahok to the governor’s office while on trial for alleged blasphemy. Allies of the government have been reportedly preparing moves to block an inquiry. One of the protesters, Habib Salim from Subang, West Java, told the crowd that the House had no reason to defend Ahok. “On behalf of every Muslim in Indonesia, we shall not show mercy to the blasphemy violator,” he said before the crowd. The rally was also attended by firebrand Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab, who has been in the spotlight for allegedly insulting state ideology Pancasila. During the rally, the protesters also demanded the House pressure the National Police to stop criminalizing Muslim leaders. Besides Rizieq, FPI spokesman Munarman is also facing charges for having reportedly insulted Balinese tradition. Separately, Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Mochammad Iriawan denounced the protesters’ claim and emphasized that the police had not criminalized anyone, including Muslim clerics. “The police named someone a suspect based on sufficient evidence,” he defended. The National Police deployed 28,000 officers to safeguard the rally. Jakarta Traffic Police also rerouted traffic in the area. Two weeks ago, thousands of protesters staged a rally near Istiqlal Grand Mosque in Central Jakarta and marched along thoroughfares in Central Jakarta from the mosque to Jl. Jend. Sudirman. The rally was reportedly marred by violence as two journalists who were reporting the rally were allegedly assaulted by protesters. Earlier Monday, the rally coordinator from the Muslim People’s Forum (FUI), Bernard Abdul Jabbar, hinted that a larger protest would be staged in April. Prior to Tuesday’s rally, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the country’s largest Muslim organization, declared that its members would not participate in the rally and prohibited any party from using its name during the rally. Meanwhile, another prominent Muslim organization, Muhammadiyah, advised its members not to participate in the rally.

"Sat, February 25 2017",Greater Jakarta: FPI leader to testify against Ahok,"Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab, a longtime nemesis of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, will be presented as a witness in the latter’s 12th blasphemy hearing on Feb. 28, Ahok’s defense team has revealed. “Witnesses presented by the prosecutors will be Abdul Chair Ramadhan, an Indonesian Ulema Council [MUI] criminal law expert, and Rizieq Shihab, the FPI leader,” Ahok’s lawyer, Edi Danggur, told reporters on Thursday. He said that Rizieq would testify as a religious expert and had been recommended by the MUI in a letter signed by MUI executive Sodikun and secretary-general Anwar Abbas in November last year, tribunnews.com reported. Rizieq, who has been named a suspect for allegedly insulting state ideology Pancasila, has been in the forefront of mass demonstrations against Ahok. Last year, he led two large rallies to demand the prosecution and imprisonment of Ahok for an alleged blasphemous remark made during a working visit to Thousand Islands in September last year.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/02/25/greater-jakarta-fpi-leader-testify-against-ahok.html,,2017
"Tue, February 28 2017","Rizieq, Ahok to have first face-off in court","Rizieq Shihab ( left ) (JP/Dhoni Setiawan) - Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (JP/Seto Wardhana) Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama is scheduled to be pitted against his nemesis, Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab, for the first time in court on Tuesday. The North Jakarta District Court confirmed on Monday that Rizieq would attend the session, the 10th in the trial, as an expert witness on religion to corroborate the blasphemy charges against Ahok. FPI spokesman Slamet Ma’ruf also confirmed that, “Insya Allah [God willing], he will attend. We have made preparations.” Slamet said Rizieq would bring along a Quranic interpretation book to strengthen his arguments in the hearing. “He will bring along a Quranic interpretation book for guidance,” Slamet said, adding that Rizieq would also bring other Islamic books. The much-awaited face-off is likely to reignite interest in the trial at the Agriculture Ministry auditorium in South Jakarta amid reports that the last five sessions were attended by much fewer visitors, either Ahok supporters or anti-Ahok protesters, in comparison with the packed initial sessions. In the earlier hearings, the Jakarta Police had to deploy 2,000 personnel, while the court decided to move the venue from the busy Jl. Gajah Mada in West Jakarta to another location in South Jakarta to prevent traffic gridlock caused by demonstrations. The presence of Rizieq, who has taken a prominent role behind all the anti-Ahok rallies, will put more pressure on Ahok, who has to cope with other nagging issues. Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent, managed to lead the first round of the Jakarta gubernatorial election on Feb. 15, eliminating contender Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono and edging over Anies Baswedan by a whisker. Despite leading, he did not secure the majority of the votes needed to ensure victory in the first round. Hence, the election must proceed to a runoff race with him and Anies locking horns. Political observers have predicted that the second round would see mounting sectarianism as conservative Muslim groups would once again bring up identity politics to prevent the incumbent governor from winning the election. Problems also hit Ahok upon his return to office from the three-and-a-half-month hiatus he took to campaign. Ahok has had to eat humble pie as many areas across the city were swamped by floods last week. Ahok is also facing opposition from city councillors who threaten to boycott all deliberations between the city council and Ahok’s administration pending Ahok’s suspension from his position. In the meantime, 90 House of Representatives members have recently agreed to use their inquiry rights to initiate an investigation into the government’s decision to allow Ahok’s return to office. Meanwhile, Rizieq appeared not as strong as when he shared the stage with President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo in front of millions of protesters at the National Monument (Monas) Square in Central Jakarta on Dec. 2, 2016 to demand Ahok’s incarceration. Rizieq has been implicated in at least two cases. He was named a suspect for defaming Pancasila, the state ideology, by the Bandung Police in West Java. He has also been accused of having engaged in an affair with activist Firza Huzein, who is a treason suspect.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/02/28/rizieq-ahok-have-first-face-court.html,,2017
"Wed, March 1 2017","Rizieq lets rip, Ahok tight-lipped in court face-off","Face to face: Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, who is standing trial on blasphemy charges, listens to Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab, who testified against him on Tuesday.(JP/Raisan Al Farisi/Pool) Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab turned a courtroom into his pulpit on Tuesday as he launched a bitter diatribe against his nemesis, Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, confirming years of conflict between the two, during the 12th hearing of Ahok’s blasphemy trial at the Ministry of Agriculture’s auditorium in Ragunan, South Jakarta. However, the governor and his legal team, who sat impassively through the virulent testimony, declined to respond, sticking to their stance from the beginning of the trial that Rizieq’s questionable record deprived his testimony of any credibility. Despite his reputation for being hot-tempered, Ahok maintained his composure throughout the hearing. The governor has reportedly asked to be referred to “Basuki” now, rather than “Ahok,” in an apparent attempt to transform his image, suggesting that the latter name has become associated with harshness and ill temper. During the hearing, Rizieq called again for the immediate incarceration of Ahok, saying the governor was a repeat offender and should not be permitted to evade the law. “As an expert, I urge the judges to detain the suspect so he won’t repeat his conduct of insulting ulema. [We’re] also concerned that he might attempt to flee,” Rizieq told the judges. Rizieq tore into Ahok, insisting that the sharp-tongued governor had intentionally committed blasphemy during his now notorious speech in Thousand Islands regency on Sept. 27. Rizieq’s court performance was not unexpected as for about five years he has diligently orchestrated protests calling for the dismissal of Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent. Rizieq’s FPI took its first shot in 2012 when Ahok was elected as deputy Jakarta governor with Joko “Jokowi” Widodo as governor. In October that year the hard-line group protested in front of the City Council, questioning the deputy governor’s role in relation to specific Muslim agencies. The protesters demanded councilors change the rules on the deputy governor’s duties as well as demanding that Ahok convert to Islam. After Jokowi won the 2014 presidential election, the FPI’s opposition to Ahok mounted and was expressed in the form of frequent protests, some of which turned violent. During Idul Adha, the Islamic Day of Sacrifice, that year, the FPI accused the governor of banning Muslims from slaughtering qurban (sacrificial animals). Ahok denied the accusation, saying he had only prohibited the slaughter of animals in public places, including schools. In 2015 and 2016, FPI protests against Ahok escalated further as the group started to criticize Ahok’s policies, including the city budget and the controversial Sumber Waras Hospital development, until the governor’s alleged blasphemy surfaced in an internet video in September. Three massive rallies, in all of which Rizieq played a prominent role, protesting against Ahok’s alleged blasphemy were held on Oct. 14, Nov. 4 and Dec. 2, 2016. During the Oct. 14 rally, Rizieq told thousands of protesters that he might murder Ahok if the police failed to prosecute him for blasphemy. Given the past history between the two men, Humprey Djemat, Ahok’s lawyer, urged the judges to set aside Rizieq’s testimony. He also brought up Rizieq’s criminal record. “Rizieq has twice been found guilty of committing crimes. He is an ex-convict,” Humprey told the judges. In 2003, Rizieq was jailed for seven months for incitement leading to public disorder. Rizieq was again imprisoned, this time for a year-and-a-half, in 2008 for again inciting members of his organization to create a public disturbance. Rizieq, Humprey said, was currently a suspect in a case related to an insult to the state ideology, Pancasila. Humphrey also alluded to rumors of an affair between Rizieq and a female activist currently being investigated for treason. Humprey’s request was dismissed by the panel of judges, led by Dwiarso Budi Santiarto, who decided to proceed with the hearing. The animosity between Rizieq and Ahok was visible as Rizieq left after giving his testimony, he refused to shake hands with Ahok or his lawyers.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/03/01/rizieq-lets-rip-ahok-tight-lipped-court-face.html,,2017
"Fri, March 24 2017",Contemplating a sharia-influenced capital,"Jakarta’s 12 million residents and commuters are beginning to consider the possibility of a more Islamic-influenced atmosphere in the capital if Anies Baswedan wins the gubernatorial election on April 19. Some are hoping for a sharia-nuanced Jakarta, like Aceh’s capital Banda Aceh, the West Java town of Tasikmalaya or Tangerang on the outskirts of Jakarta, and some are not. These contemplations have amplified after Anies was left as the only rival to incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama following last month’s first-round election. A recent exit poll by Indikator Politik finds that nearly 52.5 percent of voters favor Anies for the run-off election, versus 44 percent for Ahok. Anies, a former culture and education minister, is known as a moderate Muslim intellectual and has denied accusations that he is sowing the seeds of conservative Islam in Jakarta, or allowing a culture of intolerance to build up against non-Muslims. However, such expectations of a more sharia-nuanced city have come from his running mate, businessman Sandiaga Uno. Sandiaga said in January that he envisioned a sharia-inspired nightlife entertainment network in Jakarta. The American-educated Sandiaga sees current entertainment centers as places prone to drug and alcohol abuse and prostitution. He said the nightlife entertainment programs, which he claimed would be modeled on the kind of night-life available in Dubai, would feature traditional dances, shalawat (salutation to Prophet Muhammad), religious studies and traditional music. From a certain perspective, this could be a good thing. With such programs, vigilantes will not have as many opportunities to raid nightlife establishments and the firebrand Islam Defenders Front (FPI) could build up a better reputation by restraining it impulse to violence. The possibility of a Muslim governor among those who want to see Ahok ousted and imprisoned for allegedly insulting Islam have led some to hope for the establishment of a moral police force like in Aceh, who can arrest gamblers, unmarried couples engaged in intimate contact (khalwat) and other such sinners. Of course, the arrested people will not be whipped and caned by hooded figures like those in Aceh, since at present, Jakarta has no such bylaw regulating this kind of punishment. However, the city council might think such a rule is needed for the good morals of Jakartans. Some may think fears of the establishment of a moral police are groundless. However, concerns about the expanding influence of sharia are fueled by Anies himself. In January, he turned up at the headquarters of the FPI headquarters, and passionately stated that he was neither a Shiite nor a liberal, as some conservative Muslims had claimed. This statement might have been important for Anies, who holds a PhD in political science from the Northern Illinois University in the United States. To lock in the Muslim vote, Anies might have calculated that securing the support of the “Islamic” base was a good deal more important that winning over the despised Shiite minority or the much-maligned “secular” people. He has pledged to use next year’s budget to allocate some Rp 70 trillion (US$5.3 billion) to help all mass organizations (ormas) in the city, which would include Islamic groups. Perhaps more importantly for voters, including many poor Muslims, he has pledged to use the budget to help residents buy houses or apartments through a long-term installment scheme without down payments. In a meeting with FPI leaders, Anies has also said he had successfully extinguished a “fire” on his campus, the private Paramadina University where he was rector, a university that was founded by the progressive Muslim scholar Nurcholish Madjid, by rejecting proposals for classes on sexual minorities. Anies’ objection to interfaith marriages reportedly ended the facilitation of such marriages by the Paramadina Foundation several years ago. Perhaps Anies was also trying to convince the FPI that he shared their views on the “problem” of the “gays”. Early last year, the FPI dispersed an event featuring lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Indonesians at a Central Jakarta hotel. Last November, the police reportedly broke up a gay party at an apartment in South Jakarta after receiving a tip-off from the FPI. Many Western educated liberals have expressed dismay over Anies’ apparent shift, as they thought he was someone who generally supported liberal philosophy. In an article titled “Ini Soal Tenun Kebangsaan. Titik!” (It’s all about weaving nationalism. Period!) that he wrote in Kompas on Sept. 11, 2012, Anies decried attacks conducted by intolerant groups who were “tearing up the fabric of the nation.” Roughly five years on, some observers might say Anies himself has helped to tear down the fabric of the nation by playing the religious card. With his cool style, Anies has repeatedly denied that he is engaging in such fundamentally sectarian politics and denies his team was behind the controversial declaration of some mosques, through banners, that they would refuse to perform prayers for deceased Muslims who were suspected of supporting or voting for Ahok. Criticism toward Anies is possibly exaggerated and merely an expression of a fear of Islam. What’s wrong with being religious, after all? Anies, the founder of the nationwide Indonesia Mengajar (Indonesia teaches) movement, has pledged that if he wins the election, he will establish Islamic study groups in government offices as an example to other cities across the country, and will encourage mass prayers, which are recommended in Islam. Under governor Anies, we would therefore witness supposedly lazy and corrupt civil servants become more religious. Mosques in the offices of the administration will be full. People, including me, will again conduct our prayers in public, not just in front of my wife. I will start showing my ability to read and memorize the Quran like I used to at a pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in East Java. All thanks to Anies. Playing identity politics in this current wave of populism may indeed propel Anies to the governorship. He may make us all into devout civil servants. But there are dramatic costs to playing the identity politics card. It is an extremely dangerous turn of affairs for those of us who cherish Indonesia’s peaceful diversity. ___________________________ The author is a staff writer at The Jakarta Post.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/03/24/contemplating-a-sharia-influenced-capital.html,,2017
"Mon, April 3 2017",Voters fear intimidation from anti-Ahok movement,"In less than three weeks, 7 million people in the capital will have the chance to exercise their voting rights in the runoff of one of the fiercest gubernatorial elections in the city’s history. While recent elections in the capital have been largely free of conflicts, this time a large mass movement called Tamasya Al-Maidah (Al-Maidah Tour) has cast lingering fear among voters, especially with hard-line group Islam Defenders Front (FPI) expected to join the movement. Named after a verse in the Quran that is often used by conservative Muslim political groups to urge Muslims to vote for political candidates of the same faith as themselves, the movement aims to deploy at least 100 volunteers to supervise 1,000 polling stations that they consider prone to foul play on election day on April 19. Al-Maidah Tour initiator Farid Poniman claimed that more than 100,000 people had joined the movement and others would follow suit. When The Jakarta Post checked the apps on Sunday evening, more than 5,000 people had downloaded Al-Maidah Tour from Google Play Store. Farid said such a large number of supervisors was needed because he was certain that the potential for fraud on election day was great. Furthermore, the movement aimed to attract at least 1 million people who could monitor all 13,032 polling stations in the capital. “Besides trained volunteers, we will also deploy our top members at each polling station,” Farid said. Al-Maidah Tour also asked its volunteers to wear white attire for men and full black attire for women and recite Quranic verses and Takbir (praise to Allah) at their assigned polling stations. Due to the name and nature of the movement, people are afraid that the Al-Maidah Tour could intimidate Muslims into not voting for incumbent Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, who is a Christian of Chinese ethnicity, and vote for Anies Baswedan, who is supported by a number of conservative and radical Muslim groups, instead. Farid said that while the movement had not set out to support Ahok’s rival Anies Baswedan in the election, his team often communicated with Anies about the movement so they would not overlap with each other in the field. However, Anies’ team has claimed to be unaware of the Al-Maidah Tour movement. At the same time, Ahok is grooming his own election witnesses to be stationed at polling stations, fueling concern over potential clashes between the Ahok camp and the movement. “But believe me, whatever the final result of the election, we are ready to accept it,” Farid said. “Make no mistake, we will not create any trouble or chaos.” However, many doubt that the Al-Maidah Tour will not raise a ruckus as the movement has strong ties to the FPI. FPI spokesperson Slamet Maarif confirmed that his organization would take part in the Al-Maidah Tour movement by deploying around 16,000 people on voting day. However, Slamet said the FPI had no intention of intimidating voters, adding that its members’ presence at the polling stations was simply to ensure the election went ahead without a hitch. “On the contrary, we want to make sure that no intimidation happens during the election,” he said on Saturday. Farid, meanwhile, said a large number of people from outside of Jakarta participating in the movement would be accommodated by local FPI members. Farid himself is an official of an FPI-associated group, the National Movement to Safeguard the Indonesian Ulema Council’s Fatwa (GNPF-MUI). Devie Nova, a resident of Tanjung Priok in North Jakarta, said the presence of many strangers claiming to be a monitoring team at her polling station would cause nothing but anxiety and worry among her and her neighbors. She believed that official supervisory teams deployed by the Elections Supervisory Agency (Bawaslu) and the two candidates would be enough to monitor voting booths. “One hundred people [in each polling station] are just way too many. That many people would only make us feel anxious when we are casting our votes,” she said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/04/03/voters-fear-intimidation-anti-ahok-movement.html,,2017

"Wed, April 19 2017",Jakarta on edge as trouble brews amid heightened security,"Joining hands: National Police and Indonesian Military personnel hold up a pin promoting a peaceful gubernatorial election following a joint gathering at the Jakarta Police headquarters on Tuesday.(JP/Dhoni Setiawan) The gubernatorial runoff election has Jakarta wound up as fears of horizontal conflict loom following a clash between members of a hard-line group and its moderate rival. Indications of outsiders flocking to the capital to oppose certain gubernatorial candidates has also fueled the tension. Members of Barisan Ansor Serbaguna (Banser), the youth wing of the country’s largest Muslim organization, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), were involved in a clash with members of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) in Central Jakarta on Tuesday. The FPI accused an NU figure of distributing gifts to people in return for support for Jakarta gubernatorial candidate Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama. According to the police, FPI members surrounded the residence of Ita Rahmawati, the granddaughter of NU co-founder Abdul Wahab Hasbullah, alleging her of campaigning for Ahok. Banser personnel then reportedly came to Ita’s rescue, and retaliated by surrounding the residence of cleric Buya Abdul Majid, the head of FPI’s Jakarta chapter in Central Jakarta. Clashes ensued near Buya’s house, and the FPI was outnumbered. Before spiraling out of control, the police jumped in to disperse the crowd, but arrested no perpetrators. While denying Banser had any role in supporting Ahok, the organization staged a show of force later in the afternoon, attended by thousands of its members in an event it called the Humanity and National Gathering to commemorate the organization’s anniversary in Ragunan, South Jakarta. The FPI later made a press statement condemning the attack and demanded the police detain Banser members accused of attacking its members. “We also call on all FPI personnel and Betawi fighters to ensure the safety of our clerics until the situation in relation to the election is conducive,” said Buya. The FPI has spearheaded a movement to prevent Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent, from winning the election through provocations and mass rallies. The police, however, have taken the incident lightly, and will not comply with the FPI’s demand for investigation into the attack. “It is just a misunderstanding between the groups. The police arrived just in time to prevent the clash,” Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Raden Prabowo Argo Yuwono said. Authorities have stepped up security around the capital, as National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian said more than 60,000 police and military personnel would be deployed to secure the poll. Tito said special forces, such as the Army’s Kopassus, and the Navy’s Marine Corps would be on standby to anticipate any problems. “There will be one police officer, one military personnel, plus other security personnel at each polling station,” Tito said. Police assigned to secure the main gateways to the capital have prevented several people from entering who had intended on taking part in the Tamasya Al-Maidah (Al-Maidah Tour) -a movement that encourages large numbers of people, including those from outside Jakarta, to flood the capital and “guard” polling stations. Named after a verse in the Quran that is often used by conservative Muslim groups to urge other Muslims to vote for political candidates of the same faith, the movement aims to mobilize at least 100 volunteers at each of around 1,000 polling stations they claim to be vulnerable to voter fraud on polling day. Al-Maidah Tour organizer Ansufri Idrus Sambo said at least 100,000 people had joined the program. “We’re here to prevent Ahok from winning,” Ansufri said. Police officers in Karanganyar, Central Java, stopped at least 15 mini buses and 10 private cars from taking part in the Al-Maidah Tour. Jakarta Deputy Governor Djarot Saiful Hidayat, who is also Ahok’s running mate in the election, has received reports that many of the tour participants have already arrived in East Jakarta, and has demanded that the authorities have them monitored. East Jakarta is the most populated area in the capital, and will serve as the primary battle ground for Ahok and his rival Anies Baswedan in luring votes. “I hope the authorities can guarantee there will be no intimidations in the area,” Djarot said.

"Sat, April 22 2017",Urban chat: A Ludicrous New Normal For Jakarta?,"W hat a week it’s been for Jakartans. If you’re one of those who are now worried whether the city would commit to make progress for someone like you, you’re not alone. Most minorities or advanced-thinking Jakarta residents carry that doubt now, secretly or openly. Race and religion cards have been dealt by both sides along the campaign trail. It’s well-recorded how now governor-elect Anies Baswedan and running mate Sandiaga Uno didn’t restrain the conservative hardliners from riding on their wagon. On some occasions they seemed too happy to be sharing the ride. Unfortunately the ticket of Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama and Djarot Saiful Hidayat wasn’t exactly squeaky clean on the issue either; some of my Christian or Chinese friends told me stories of serious peer pressure from ID collectors when Ahok was still trying to run independently and before voting on the election days, plus the depiction of Muslim-looking rioters circa 1998 in a campaign video released a couple of weeks ago. Living in a Chinese-dominated housing complex in West Jakarta in 1998, our house suffered damage. I personally know how it feels running inside the house and scrambling to switch off any lights when a mob outside is throwing rocks at you. I didn’t have the luxury to occupy the legislature with activists because I was too busy taking turns in a neighborhood watch with the Chinese uncles and aunts on our blocks. The mob outside our house that evening, where my parents still live to this day, was a ragtag crew who weren’t wearing any Muslim paraphernalia or chanting Allahu akbar (God is great). The video gave me mixed feelings. I was reminded of one of the most traumatic events of my life, yet at the same time got confused with the Muslim generalization. I was sad the day the campaign video was released because it meant both sides were officially playing race and religion cards regardless of the higher stake of national unity. The election was in Jakarta, but the exemplary dirty plot was made available for all Indonesia. Yet for all my disagreements with Ahok, I have much more serious problems with the likes of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) being granted access to government. It was quite hard to see someone like Anies Baswedan, who’d been known for voluntary outreach teaching in Indonesia Mengajar and profound phrases like “ tenun kebangsaan ” (weaving nationality) , illustrating how a national identity formed like handwoven fabrics is now in bed with religious fascists. I suppose Anies read statistics and understood that riding on the momentum of conservatism to win the governor’s seat was worth shredding his precious tenun kebangsaan . You, Sir, have now given tenun a bad name. Besides turning the word tenun into countless jokes, what will Anies bring for Jakartans in the next five years? He threw many promises onto the campaign trail, yet the one grabbing the most attention was the promise of landed houses for the cost of Rp 350 million (US$25,925) with down payments of either zero percent or zero rupiah. (I am not sure — he kept flipping on the pledge.) Anybody who’s been house-hunting in Jakarta, let alone involved in the property business, knew how ludicrous that promise was. Being a good resident who respects democracy I won’t debate the plausibility of that scheme anymore, I’ll just march down to Anies and Sandiaga after inauguration and demand to see the houses. I don’t own a landed house yet — if there are any such houses for that price in Jakarta I’d like to purchase one before the end of the year, please. Another promise was an improvement to the present, cashless, smartcard program, the Kartu Jakarta Pintar (KJP). Now used to obtain goods and services related to health or education, the card would be made available to churn out cash as well. A tempting offer for any household on a tight budget, yet I genuinely wonder how the government would guarantee its usage for the intended purposes. Cash is so liquid it can leave no paper trail on Indonesia’s bustling informal sector — I want to watch how Anies and Sandi personally make sure it is used to finance, for example, infant vaccinations instead of shiny contraptions. Even if all the rosy promises came to fruition, one fact remained unchanged — race and religion cards have now been proven effective for open political campaigns. There aren’t enough moderate Islamic clerics strong enough to lure back devout Muslims sidetracked by firebrand hardliners, despite the repeated claims of tens of millions of Muslims adhering to peaceful organizations like Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah. The situation may easily go downhill now; if a non-Muslim man can’t be governor, perhaps now a non-Muslim boy can’t be class president. Since only men can lead a Muslim prayer, perhaps now a woman can’t lead the country. The post-1998 conservatism trend wasn’t started by Anies and Sandiaga, but it was their 2016-2017 gubernatorial campaign that openly milked it to the utmost. FPI leader Rizieq Shihab cozily standing next to Anies delivering his victory speech is possibly the new normal Jakartans need to stomach now. Brexit, Trump, Anies and God know what can happen this Sunday in the French election. A continuing nausea may just be our new normal, peeps. ______________________________________ Lynda Ibrahim is a Jakarta-based writer with a penchant for purple, pussycats and pop culture.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/04/22/urban-chat-a-ludicrous-new-normal-for-jakarta.html,,2017
"Thu, April 27 2017",Greater Jakarta: Police to question Rizieq’s wife,"Jakarta Police have scheduled the questioning of the wife of Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab in the ongoing investigation into a steamy WhatsApp conversation that allegedly took place between the firebrand preacher and Firza Husein, a treason suspect. “We will question [Rizieq’s wife, Syarifah] to ask whether Firza has always been present during pengajian [Islamic learning forums],” Jakarta Police spokesperson Sr. Comr.

However, none of them turned up. “They had other things to attend to. Investigators will reschedule the questioning,” Argo said. The case sparked controversy when an intimate WhatsApp exchange containing nude photos of a woman believed to be Firza that she purportedly sent to Rizieq went viral on the internet.

"Thu, May 4 2017",Jakartans call for help against radicalism,"Say it with flowers: People take photographs in front of flower boards at the National Police headquarters in Jakarta on Wednesday. The flower boards were sent as signs of people’s support for the police and Indonesian military over their efforts to eradicate radicalism and thuggery and to guard the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia (NKRI).(JP/Dhoni Setiawan) As Jakartans are still reeling from the most divisive gubernatorial election the city has ever seen, which exacerbated sectarianism and fanned anti-Chinese sentiments, some citizens have called on the government to protect the capital from any threat from radicals. On Wednesday the State Palace, as well as the headquarters of the National Police, the Jakarta Police and the Indonesian Military (TNI), were adorned with dozens of flower boards bearing messages calling on the government to curb radicalism. “We are ready to support the military and the police to eradicate radicalism and maintain the unity of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia [NKRI],” read one flower board that had been put on the front yard of the Jakarta Police headquarters in Senayan, South Jakarta. “Save the NKRI, curb radicalism,” read another flower board. The two flower boards were among more than 20 flower arrangements set up at the police’s headquarters. “To be honest, we have no idea who put all these flowers here,” said Jakarta Police spokesperson Sr. Comr. Argo Yuwono on Wednesday. He appreciated the act and deemed it to be part of the nation’s democracy. “Certainly, this is a form of citizens showing their aspirations. They address their appreciation and motivations toward the police. They will encourage us to continue safeguarding Jakarta,” Argo said. Flower boards were also sent to the State Palace as a token of gratitude to President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo for his role in maintaining Pancasila as the state ideology. The senders, however, also pointed out that the police and the military were still an important part of guarding Jakarta from the threat of disunity and radicalism. The gesture came a few weeks after the Jakarta runoff election, described by experts as the country’s most polarizing election with racial and religious issues overshadowing the city’s most critical problems, including education and infrastructure. Riding a growing wave of religious conservatism, former culture and education minister Anies Baswedan won the election, beating incumbent Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, who was dogged by allegations he had committed blasphemy while seeking election. Some political experts said Anies owed his success in the runoff election to Muslim voters who decided to throw their support behind him, mobilized by Muslim groups, including the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Following Ahok’s loss in the election, thousands of people showed their support for the governor by turning City Hall into a jungle of colorful flower boards last week. Admirers sent flower boards to express their sympathy, sadness, or support for Ahok and Deputy Governor Djarot Saiful Hidayat, who conceded defeat in the April 19 election ahead of the official announcement of the results. A political analyst from Indo Barometer, M. Qodari, said that the flowers sent to the military and the police headquarters were a clear sign that there were some Jakarta residents who were worried about the impact of the election. Qodari described the flowers as a “cry for help” from Jakarta residents, besides being a token of gratitude to law enforcement officers. “Some people are worried that recently conservative groups have gotten a bigger stage and have taken control of the public sphere,” he told The Jakarta Post. “Therefore, they ask for help from the police and the military.” Messages on other flower arrangements called for the police to arrest FPI leader Rizieq Shihab and to disband his organization. Responding to the messages, Argo said, “There is nothing wrong with sending messages through flowers. Deciding whether to say something has broken the law is up to the police.” (dea)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/04/jakartans-call-help-against-radicalism.html,,2017
"Thu, May 4 2017",Greater Jakarta: Police confiscate FPI leader’s phone,"The Jakarta Police have confiscated a cell phone belonging to firebrand Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab. The confiscation of the phone took place in relation to the police’s investigation into pornographic conversations that allegedly occurred between Rizieq and Firza Husein, a treason suspect. The steamy chats leaked onto the internet earlier this year. The leaked material was uploaded onto the now-blocked website baladacintarizieq.com. Screenshots of the chats display controversial messages and nude pictures. A voice message allegedly containing Firza’s voice was also uploaded. The phone was not taken from Rizieq himself, but from Muchsin Alatas, head of the FPI Jakarta branch, said Jakarta Police spokesperson Sr. Comr. Argo Yuwono. “[The police got the phone] from someone else. From Muchsin,” Argo said as quoted by wartakota.tribunnews.com on Tuesday, adding that the phone was not given to them voluntarily. The investigators, he said, found messages containing “intense things” between Rizieq and Firza on the phone. However, he refused to disclose the content. “We will reveal it all during trial,” he said. The police detained Firza last February and searched her house in Lubang Buaya, East Jakarta, to obtain evidence regarding the case. Firza was later released.

"Fri, May 5 2017","Indonesian Muslims’ ignorance exposed, again","Jakartans have decided. The majority of them picked Anies Baswedan and Sandiaga Uno as governor and deputy governor of the capital city. Anies and Sandiaga are overjoyed and their supporters are flaunting their victory on social media while telling supporters of incumbent Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama and Deputy Governor Djarot Saiful Hidayat how wrong they are. Prabowo Subianto, the man behind the nomination of Anies and Sandiaga and the losing contender in the 2014 presidential election, hailed the notorious Rizieq Shihab and his Islam Defenders Front (FPI) as “the saviors of democracy.” What is “democracy” according to Prabowo and what exactly did the FPI “save” it from? These are questions that have conveniently been ignored. People’s responses on social media vary, but the most common reactions among Muslims center around how Jakartans need to accept the outcome of the election, along with the usual admonitions to give the presumptive elected governor and deputy governor a chance to show their capacities in leading the capital, and suggestions for reconciliation between the supporters of both sides of the political divide. Peaceful reconciliation is always good and expected, but “peaceful reconciliation” as a mask to ignore a vicious campaign against marginalized groups and Muslim Ahok supporters that were, and still are, deployed by Anies-Sandiaga supporters and their self-styled religious gatekeepers — the National Movement to Safeguard the Indonesian Ulema Council’s Fatwa (GNPF-MUI) — simply has to be rejected. Made Supriatma, a well-known scholar and activist, elaborated on this topic very well in his latest article published by IndoProgress on why we should not forget about the cruelty of Anies-Sandiaga’s campaign against marginalized groups. The Jakarta election was a wake-up call for Indonesian Muslims to self-reflect and discover what is it that allows our religious teachings to be co-opted, again and again, by the power of dirty politics. One major problem with the current collective imagination of Indonesian Muslims is blindness to the chain of violence. Most of us have been incapable of seeing the gradual formation of the message of superiority of Islam through softer means, such as soap operas, Islamic self-help books and advertisements by Muslim clothing businesses. The easy-to-be-digested “religious messages” in all these elements of Indonesian Muslim pop culture reduce Islam to a competition of who gets what in heaven. Once the message of heaven and hell becomes the only thing that we care about in Islam, we will turn into automatons ready to eliminate whatever obstacles we perceive stand between us and heaven, including the presence of others with religious and cultural differences. Another source of hatred for the others within Indonesian Muslim communities is that the inexplicably lax attitude toward the idea of an “Islamic state” (whatever that means). As a country with huge potential in the power of the Muslim majority, and experience with Islamic claims to overthrow the national government, Indonesia can be said to be turning a blind eye to this pathological idea of an “Islamic state” that has infected many civic elements of Muslim society, including university students, for so long. A few years ago, Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), with its idea of a khilafah (caliphate), might have occupied a peripheral position within the realm of Indonesian Islamic activism. Today, the ideology of HTI is being promoted freely, including by scholars who invoke the authority of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) to justify their demand for a khilafah in Jember, East Java. The last problem lies in the absence of significant counter-narratives that can oppose and invalidate religious claims made by hard-line groups like the GNPF-MUI. Up to today, the destiny of Indonesian Islam hangs on a small number of progressive Muslim scholars (including Mun’im Sirry, Nadirsyah Hosen, Syafiq Hasyim and others) who are willing to continuously fight the spread of extremism among Indonesian Muslim communities through their writings and activism. However, these lone-fighters for a moderate Islam need more institutional support from major organizations, especially the NU, Muhammadiyah and universities. Without such support, these organizations will never gain more influence among the majority of Indonesian Muslims. Watching a video in which one of the highest officials of the Muhammadiyah youth wing openly threatened to depose President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo if a heavier sentence was not handed down to Ahok in his nonexistent crime of blasphemy, it is time for the NU and Muhammadiyah to clearly state their opposition to the GNPF-MUI, and to prohibit their members from participating in the spreading of pathological messages. Watching another video in which university da’wah (proselytization) activists from across Indonesia gathered at the elite Bogor Agricultural University (IPB) to express their support for the khilafah ideology, I cannot help but wonder about how many decades progressive Indonesian Muslim scholars and activists will need to undo this destructive ideology, with which some university student have been brainwashed. One thing that is certain, we cannot cease to fight this ideology of the khilafah and must continue to reassert the primacy of the Islam which took shape in our archipelago, Islam Nusantara. _______________________________ The writer is a PhD student in theology at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, US.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/05/indonesian-muslims-ignorance-exposed-again.html,,2017
"Wed, May 10 2017",Should Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia be banned?,"The government’s announcement that it would ban Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) has sparked controversy and debate. Many support the ban because the Islamic organization promotes the establishment of a caliphate, which threatens the unity of the country and Pancasila state ideology. Many others view the ban as a clear sign of the government of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s anti-Islam posture. Although I do not agree with the idea of the global caliphate HTI promotes, I am against the banning of the group. Such a policy would be counterproductive for Indonesia’s democracy. HTI’s visions and activities are different from those of mainstream of Indonesian Muslim organizations. The HTI envisions the formation of a khilafah (caliphate) as the universal Islamic political goal and rejects democracy. As prominent historian Azyumardi Azra stated, the HTI is very popular among the young generation, both in the Middle East and in the West. Along with other Islamic groups, such as the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), the Indonesian Young Ulema and Intellectuals Council (MIUMI) and Wahdah Islamiyah, the HTI formed the National Movement to Safeguard the Indonesian Council of Ulema’s Fatwa (GNPF-MUI) and organized a series of rallies to demand the imprisonment of Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian of Chinese descent, for insulting Islam. The HTI is seen as controversial because of its persistent propaganda for a change to the government system to a caliphate, which it says is a solution to all problems of life. It calls on its followers to shun elections because they are a product of an infidel system. The HTI also seeks the banning of Ahmadiyah, Shia and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. Despite the HTI’s aim for an Islamic state, banning the group runs counter to the Constitution, which gives all citizens equal rights, including the right to express faith and belief. HTI members are Indonesian citizens, like members of Ahmadiyah, Shia and the LGBT community, who the state has to protect rather than threaten. Realizing the ban would mean the government is violating the law, which requires the government to send three letters of reprimand beforehand. The ban would be justified after all the warnings were left unheeded. The problem facing Indonesia today is the absence of a specific law that assertively governs matters such as the HTI case. In many religious issues, for example, the government tends to resort to the 1965 Blasphemy Law, which is problematic. There are no specific provisions that define hate speech and how to deal with it. The law is enforced to blame Ahok or members of a minority group like the Ahmadiyah, but FPI leader Rizieq Shihab can escape from this law. It is a clear example how the law is biased. It often protects the majority, but discriminates against minorities. In the case of the HTI, the government should learn from how several countries have dealt with Hizbut Tahrir and other organizations. Australia and Canada, for example, have not banned Hizbut Tahrir and give its members freedom to express their views and organize activities. Shiites, Ahmadiyah, Baha’i, Sikh and other minority groups receive equal treatment. The governments will ban Hizbut Tahrir or other organizations if they spread hate speech, commit violence or support acts of terrorism. Many argue that because Hizbut Tahrir is forbidden in several Islamic countries, Indonesia should follow suit. It should be noted that Indonesia is not an Islamic state, but a state that upholds freedom of religion. Indonesia is not an authoritarian state either. Authoritarian governments would not think twice about dissolving any organization that is deemed a threat to national security. Because Indonesia embraces democracy, democratic procedure should prevail in solving such problems. Banning the HTI would weaken Indonesian democracy. The banning of the HTI would set a bad precedent as the government would target other groups it considered a threat to national unity or harmony. Then the government would revive authoritarianism and there would be no guarantee that such authoritarian policy would not be enforced against moderate Islamic groups like Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah, as happened in the past. The banning of the HTI would be counterproductive. In this context, I agree with Australian National University security expert Clive Williams’ analysis on banning Hizbut Tahrir in Australia. As he noted, it would not gain any desirable or useful purpose because it would stimulate Hizbut Tahrir to grow even bigger. Hizbut Tahrir has an effective system of going underground when banned. It would activate its cells to recruit members and proselytize its ideas. If the HTI were to go underground, there would be a potential for Indonesians to switch to terrorist groups because the government could not control them directly. It would be a different story if the government were to acknowledge the HTI and therefore be able to regulate it. History has taught us a lesson. Banning Islamic Party Masyumi and Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) for alleged insurgency during the Old Order and New Order regimes respectively not only had serious impacts on their members but also transformed the government into an authoritarian regime. Following the PKI ban, its members and their families fell victim to violence and the world recorded it as the most tragic episode in Indonesian history. Similar violence befell People’s Democratic Party (PRD) members after the Soeharto regime banned it in 1997. In conclusion, one of our serious problems today is how to deal with anti-democratic ideas in a fragile democracy like Indonesia. Political science professor Dankwart Rustow argued that democratization could occur when all people and political actors agreed to uphold democratic principles and values to solve their problems and to build a new consensus through laws. Banning the HTI is not as simple as a matter of like and dislike, but will test our democratic maturity. The government should take into consideration the Constitution and legislation pertaining to freedom of religion and freedom of expression in responding to the HTI issue. Banning the group is not a wise decision. ___________________________________ The writer, who is pursuing a PhD at the University of Toronto, Canada, is a researcher at MAARIF Institute for Culture and Humanity and lecturer at Muhammadiyah University Jakarta.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/10/should-hizbut-tahrir-indonesia-be-banned.html,,2017
"Fri, May 12 2017",The test of our democracy,"The blasphemy trial and conviction of the now non-active Jakarta governor, Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, have raised more worries for Indonesia’s minorities and the majority of moderate Muslims. On the heels of the divisive Jakarta election, which Ahok lost, the confidence of Islamists has risen, although many of their aspirations and actions were alien and hostile to fellow Muslims. Therefore, it is with mixed feelings that Indonesians greet the government’s plan to disband the Hizbut Thahrir Indonesia (HTI), the local branch of a global Islamic khilafah (caliphate movement) long banned in other countries. Compared to those of vigilante groups, HTI members are not known as rabble-rousers, yet their aspirations for a global caliphate, not unlike that of the Islamic State (IS) movement, contradicts the republic’s basic principles. The HTI has also joined the anti-Ahok cause with its members joining rallies to demand his imprisonment and carrying banners promoting the khilafah. Many worried members of the public then sent flower boards to the National Police and Indonesian Military headquarters, giving them a subtle message that the republic should not be replaced with sharia-inspired laws. On Monday, Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Wiranto suddenly said the government was moving to ban the HTI, a plan that was swiftly challenged. Former law minister Yusril Isra Mahendra reminded the government that since the HTI is a legal organization, its dissolution must follow procedures in the law on mass organizations; we therefore hail the government’s plan to go to court on the issue. Other groups are distancing themselves from the HTI. The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) rushed to claim it was “different” from the HTI, maintaining that the FPI was based on Pancasila, even though its leader Rizieq Shihab has reportedly insulted the state ideology. The revised law on mass organizations is a legacy of the New Order regime and has been used to justify the banning of several organizations. with unclear reasons. Today’s authorities show similar inconsistency. Wiranto said the HTI only caused tension, but what about other groups that have long created public disturbances? What these groups have done involving violence and hate speech could have been enough reason for the government to give warnings and, if necessary, decide on their dissolution. President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo may be sending a warning to vocal Islamist groups ahead of his 2019 reelection bid, starting with the HTI. But hundreds of thousands of HTI members would simply go underground. Indonesia needs a democracy that would allow for a pluralism of identities and beliefs, including that of minorities like Shiites and Ahmadis, which the HTI want to see banned. It is tempting to simply ban anyone or any organization campaigning on ideas that contradict our basic principles, ideas like the creation of an Islamic state. However, we would be repeating the mistakes of the past authoritarian regime if we crush legitimate organizations simply because they are not part of the establishment.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/12/the-test-our-democracy.html,,2017
"Wed, May 17 2017",Jokowi scrambles to ease tension,"Leaders’ meeting: President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo (left) talks to National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian (center) as Indonesian Military commander Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo looks on after their meeting with leaders of different religions and faiths at the State Palace in Jakarta on Tuesday. The President asked everyone to refrain from making statements that could increase sectarian tension and ordered the National Police chief and Indonesian Military commander to take stern action against those threatening national unity.(Antara/Puspa Perwitasar) President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, who barely took a break following an overseas trip, scrambled on Tuesday to contain sectarian tension that escalated following a court decision to imprison non-active Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama for blasphemy. Soon after he arrived at the State Palace from his trip to Palu, Central Sulawesi, his last stopover after a two-day visit to Beijing, he did not even have time to change his suit before going into another meeting to discuss efforts to de-escalate the growing tension. The meeting, which was hastily arranged at the State Palace, took place between Jokowi and representatives from the country’s key religious organizations. Joining the religious leaders were National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian and Indonesian Military (TNI) commander Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo, who Jokowi instructed to crack down on individuals or parties responsible for spreading hate speech that could aggravate the tension. The President was reported to have been growing anxious amid the worsening sectarian tension while attending China’s One Belt One Road (OBOR) conference in Beijing, and on Monday he ordered the State Secretariat to convene a meeting involving leaders of Muslim, Protestant, Catholic, Buddhist, Hindu and Confucian communities at the State Palace. During the one-hour meeting, the religious leaders expressed their commitment to help ease the tension and pledged to champion the country’s unity. “We talked about the latest dynamics that have grown more concerning. I’m happy to hear commitment from religious leaders and their followers to defend the unity of the country and Pancasila, as well as the 1945 Constitution in the spirit of Bhinneka Tunggal Ika [Unity in Diversity],” Jokowi told reporters at a press conference after the meeting. Jokowi also urged people to not stage street protests and that he would get tough on individuals or groups who posed a threat to the country’s unity. “I have ordered leaders of the National Police and TNI to not hesitate to arrest those responsible for making any verbal statements or actions that could harm the country and the principle of Bhinneka Tunggal Ika,” Jokowi said. Monday was the first time Jokowi issued a public statement to address the sectarian tension, which escalated following the decision of the North Jakarta District Court to sentence Ahok to two years in prison for insulting the Quran. The verdict on Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent, caused division among those who believed the non-active Jakarta governor was innocent and Muslim groups convinced the outspoken politician had denigrated Islam. In Makassar, South Sulawesi, hundreds of people gathered for a candlelight vigil in support of Ahok before being attacked by conservative Muslim groups. In West Kalimantan, the local Dayak community pledged that it would bar the entry of leaders of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Members of the community were motivated by a speech from West Kalimantan Governor Cornelis, who pledged he would kick out FPI leader Rizieq Shihab from the province. Two FPI leaders were forced last week to return to Jakarta only 30 minutes after landing at Supadio International Airport. Also last week, hundreds of people in the predominantly Christian Manado, North Sulawesi, swarmed Sam Ratulangi International Airport and the governor’s office to protest a visit from House of Representatives Deputy Speaker Fahri Hamzah, a politician from the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), who has been vocal in calling for the prosecution of Ahok. On Tuesday, the religious leaders invited to the meeting included individuals from the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), the country’s largest and second-largest Muslim organizations, Nahdhlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah, the Bishops Council of Indonesia (KWI), the Indonesian Communion of Churches (PGI), the Council of Buddhist Communities (Walubi), Indonesian Hindu Religious Council (PHDI) and the Confucian Supreme Council of Indonesia (Matakin). Responding to Jokowi’s call, MUI chairman Makruf Amin said religious leaders would intensify interfaith dialogue to prevent any efforts to divide the country. “We will intensify dialogue in society and strengthen the nation’s unity,” Makruf said. The rector of Muhammadiyah University in Jakarta Syaiful Bakhri, who represented Muhammadiyah during the meeting, praised Jokowi for convening the meeting. “There are concerns about disintegration.

"Wed, May 17 2017",Rizieq refuses to celebrate Idul Fitri behind bars,"The chaste lover: Firza Husein, a witness in a pornography case, arrives at the offices of the Jakarta Police for questioning on Tuesday. Firza was questioned in relation to a pornographic conversation that allegedly took place between her and Islam Defenders Front leader Rizieq Shihab.(Tribunnews/Irwan Rismawan) Hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab has been known as the loudest advocate in pushing for blasphemy charges against non-active Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama. Since late last year, the firebrand cleric has led a series of anti-Ahok rallies in the capital as he repeatedly called for the authorities to bring Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent, “to justice” for “insulting Islam.” Amid mob pressure, police and prosecutors swiftly completed Ahok’s dossier. As rallies were held by conservative Muslim groups last week, Ahok was sentenced to two years in prison for blasphemy by the North Jakarta District Court, only two weeks after Ahok lost his reelection bid amid an intense sectarian campaign. While Ahok is in detention, Rizieq, who happens to be implicated in a number of criminal cases, has failed to prove he is a law-abiding citizen, prompting harsh criticism and cynicism given the cleric’s tireless calls for the “rule of law” against Ahok. West Java Police have named Rizieq a suspect for allegedly insulting the Pancasila state ideology and the memory of Indonesia’s first president, Sukarno. He is also under investigation at the Jakarta Police in a pornography case allegedly involving him and treason suspect Firza Husein. Has has also been reported to the police in a number of cases centering on blasphemy, slander and incitement of hatred. The FPI leader failed to fulfill two summons issued by the Jakarta Police in his capacity as a witness in the pornography case on April 25 and May 10. “He is in Jeddah [Saudi Arabia],” Jakarta Police spokesperson Sr. Comr. Argo Yuwono said on Tuesday. The police said they planned to forcefully retrieve Rizieq with the help of Interpol. However, as of Tuesday, the Jakarta Police had yet to decide whether they would send a team to pick him up. “It will be the investigators’ decision because [Rizieq’s] status is still that of a witness,” Argo said, adding that the police would also coordinate with the Directorate General of Immigration at the Law and Human Rights Ministry. Rizieq’s lawyer, Kapitra Ampera, said the FPI leader had left the country, having claimed innocence. Kapitra said Rizieq went on a umrah (minor haj) with his family on April 27. The cleric continued his journey to Yemen and then Malaysia before he returned to Saudi Arabia. Kapitra said his client would not fulfill any summonses in the near future because Rizieq would likely spend Ramadhan in Mecca. He may only return to Indonesia after Idul Fitri, Kapitra added. Rizieq initially wanted to return to Indonesia last Saturday, but he decided otherwise, Kapitra said. One of the reasons was because the FPI leader had been summoned by the police over a case that “he does not understand,” the lawyer said. “[The case] has nothing to do with him. It’s even possible that the case has been orchestrated,” Kapitra said as quoted by Antara. Separately, National Police spokesperson Sr. Comr. Martinus Sitompul urged Rizieq to respect legal procedures and return to Indonesia. He said a warrant had been issued because he failed to show up twice for questioning as a witness. Jakarta Police announced last week that they would detain Rizieq as soon as he returned to Indonesia. “We have talked with [Rizieq’s] lawyer several times [regarding the matter]. We want him to fulfill his obligation as a citizen and comply with the law,” Martinus said. Directorate General of Immigration spokesperson Agung Sampurno said the decision to retrieve Rizieq by force from Saudi Arabia fell under the domain of the National Police, which coordinated with Interpol. “The immigration office cannot interfere with the process, because it’s a general criminal case,” Agung told The Jakarta Post. He further said the immigration office did not have knowledge of the type of visa Rizieq had used in making multiple visits to Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, the West Java Prosecutor’s Office has returned the dossier on Rizieq in the case pertaining to the Pancasila and Sukarno to investigators at the West Java Police. Prosecutor’s office head Setia Untung Arimuladi said there were formal and material requirements police investigators needed to complete before the dossier could be declared complete and handed over to the court. “There are 10 items that need to be refined in the formal requirements, while there are nine items for the material requirements,” Untung said in Bandung.

"Fri, May 19 2017",FPI member bids for Komnas HAM post,"Zainal Abidin, one of 60 candidates who joined the selection process for the new commissioner position at the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM), caught the most attention during a public debate, part of the screening process, on Thursday. The head of the legal team of the Semarang, Central Java, branch of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) certainly drew a large audience, composed mostly of people with a background in human rights campaigning, who were curious about what he had to say about the protection of human rights. The activists swarmed the meeting room of the Law and Human Rights Ministry where the debate took place, also to grill him on controversial issues. Zainal, who introduced himself as Zainal Petir (Zainal the Thunder), was bombarded with questions regarding his motivation to join the human rights body as well as his thoughts on the freedom of religion. Some activists also asked about his opinion regarding the protection of minority groups, including members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. “Zainal Abidin, I know you are a member of the FPI,” said Dian Kartika Sari from the Coalition of Indonesian Women (KPI). “How will you explain what you do here to your FPI colleagues?” Some members of the audience loudly grumbled when Zainal responded that his motivation to join the rights body was to put a humane face on the FPI and that, if elected, he would make no efforts to protect minority sects like Ahmadiyah. “But I will not promote violence against them,” Zainal said. Aware of animosity in the room, Zainal said the selection committee should give him a chance. “I know many of you don’t like me because of my affiliation with the FPI, which is normal for those who don’t know me personally. That’s why I have come here,” he said. Zainal may be the only candidate who has a background in the firebrand organization, but his views on minority groups are shared by other candidates running for the Komnas HAM leadership position. Fellow candidate Welya Safitri in her opening statement in the debate, for instance, defended the controversial Blasphemy Law, saying she would work to defend the law if she was elected a commissioner. “I also believe that Ahmadiyah is a heretical group,” she said. Other than the issue of intolerance, the two-day public debate also tested candidates’ knowledge on human rights issues, including human rights abuses, especially the 1965 massacre against communists, the death penalty, abuse of domestic workers, human trafficking and environmental problems. Taking advantage of the open nature of the public debate, concerned citizens have kept a close eye on the selection process. One of the activists who attended the public debate was Meidini Hutagalung, who said growing intolerance during and after the Jakarta gubernatorial election had encouraged her to come. “I recorded all the explanations from each candidates. I will present this to my community later, before we make a recommendation to the selection team on which candidate we think is suitable for the job,” Meidini told The Jakarta Post on the sidelines of the event. “I am really happy to learn that some candidates truly understand the importance of promoting tolerance, in particular. It is really good that the selection team engaged the public in the process,” she said. Following the debate, the selection team will select 28 of the 60 candidates, who will move on to the next round. Candidates who pass the public debate stage will then take a psychological test, before facing the final interview in July, which will reduce the short list to 14 candidates. The 14 candidates will then be screened at the House of Representatives Commission III, which oversees law and human rights, in October. House Commission III is expected to select seven new commissioners to serve the 2017-2022 term.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/19/fpi-member-bids-komnas-ham-post.html,,2017
"Mon, May 29 2017",Ahok blasphemy case triggers online witch hunt,"Concerns are escalating over alleged attempts by groups of people to hunt down social media users and accuse them of posting defamatory comments against religion and religious figures in an apparent attempt to exploit the nation’s draconian defamation laws. Fiera Lovita, a 40-year-old physician from Solok Regional Hospital in West Sumatra, was almost charged with defamation under the notorious Electronic Information and Transactions (ITE) Law after local members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) accused her of defaming their leader, Rizieq Shihab. On May 19 and May 21, Fiera criticized Rizieq on her Facebook page for avoiding his legal case by refusing to return home from Saudi Arabia. The firebrand cleric is facing pornography charges after screenshots featuring his alleged pornographic conversations with a woman went viral on the web. He claims that the case against him is politically motivated. The FPI members, escorted by police officers, then confronted Fiera at her workplace on May 23, asking her to delete her allegedly libelous posts and write an official letter stating that she regretted her statements. Solok Police chief Sr. Comr. Susmelawati Rosya told The Jakarta Post that the conflict between her and the FPI had been resolved. “The problem is over as she apologized on May 23,” she said on Saturday. Legal Aid Institute for the Press in Padang (LBH Pers Padang), which provided legal counsel for Fiera, said Fiera felt intimidated and threatened. “She said she no longer felt comfortable living in Solok and planned to move to another region,” LBH Pers Padang director Roni Saputra told the Post. The incident involving Fiera has alarmed human rights activists, who claim that the blasphemy conviction against non-active Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama may have encouraged people to conduct online persecution against anyone accused of defaming religion and religious figures. The Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network (SAFEnet) claims that 45 social media users from across the country, including Fiera, could be charged under Article 28 on defamation of the ITE Law as a result of the online witch hunt. SAFEnet regional coordinator Damar Juniarto said the number of defamation reports against people accused of insulting religion or ulema had increased after the Ahok conviction. He dubs this phenomenon “the Ahok Effect.” “After the court found Ahok guilty of blasphemy, many groups suddenly appeared, trawling through social media accounts they believe might have insulted religion or the ulema,” Damar told the Post on Sunday. The groups, Damar said, usually tracked down netizens who posted status updates on their accounts that appeared to criticize religion or the ulema. The groups then try to find out the personal identity of their targets. They later ask the public to come to the target’s house and deliver them to the police for violating the ITE Law. Damar mentioned a Facebook account named MUSLIMCYBER_NET as among the groups that were engaging in the wide-ranging witch hunt. “If this keeps going, this will become a serious threat to our freedom of expression,” he argued. Hard-line Islamic groups have used the nation’s problematic laws, including the 1965 Blasphemy Law, the 2008 Pornography Law and the 2016 ITE Law, to advance their interests, with Ahok’s blasphemy conviction seen as the most blatant example. On May 9, Ahok was sentenced to two years in prison for citing a Quranic verse during a speech in September. His prosecution was preceded by a series of rallies by conservative Muslims who claimed that the Christian governor had insulted the Quran. Damar said the ITE Law had long constituted a threat to freedom of expression and he criticized the police for using the law arbitrarily. He went on to say that the law failed to differentiate between private and public spaces. Even Rizieq, Damar said, should not be charged under the ITE Law for the leaked sex chats, as those things belonged to the private sphere. Separately, the police announced on Sunday that they had arrested a man for allegedly disseminating a fake conversation between National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian and Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Argo Yuwono. The man, identified as HP, who manages the instagram account muslim_cyber1, has been charged with hate speech under the ITE Law. National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Setyo Wasisto said when it came to defamation cases, the police had the discretion to meet with both parties for a mediation process. “We can solve them as best we can, but not all defamation cases can be solved. If we handle all of them, then the prisons will be full,” Setyo said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/29/ahok-blasphemy-case-triggers-online-witch-hunt.html,,2017
"Tue, May 30 2017",Police name FPI leader suspect in porn case,"Rizieq Shihab (JP) The Jakarta Police have named Rizieq Shihab, the firebrand cleric and leader of hard-line Muslim organization Islam Defenders Front (FPI), a suspect in a pornography case. Rizieq was named a suspect on Monday without having undergone police questioning in his previous capacity as a witness as he had failed to answer a police summons in April and May. “At 12 a.m. today [Monday], investigators at the Jakarta Police’s special crimes unit increased Rizieq’s status from witness to suspect,” said Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Argo Yuwono. “We have sent his dossier to the Jakarta Prosecutors’ Office.” Argo Yuwono said investigators from the Jakarta Police special crimes unit had gathered adequate evidence to increase Rizieq’s status to that of suspect. “He will be charged under articles 4, 6 and 8 of the 2008 Pornography Law,” he said. The case first surfaced late January when a now-blocked website, baladacintarizieq.com, uploaded screenshots of WhatsApp chats that allegedly took place between Rizieq and Firza Husein. The chats are filled with profanity and nude pictures allegedly of Firza, who preceded Rizieq to be named a suspect in the same case on May 16. The police sent a first summons to Rizieq on April 25 along with Firza, Rizieq’s wife and a friend of Firza’s, whose name is mentioned in the steamy chats. However, none of them showed up for various reasons. Rizieq also evaded the second questioning session on May 10 as he was abroad and his exact location was unknown even to his lawyer, Sugito Atmo Pawiro. Rizieq is currently in Saudi Arabia. When and if he comes home, the pornography case is not the only lawsuit that he is going to face. On Jan. 30, the West Java Police also named him a suspect for allegedly insulting the Pancasila, the state ideology. “In Sukarno’s Pancasila, faith in God is placed in the ass, but in Jakarta Charter’s Pancasila, faith in God is placed in the head. Which one is better?” Rizieq says in a video that went viral online and was later reported to the police by Sukmawati Soekarnoputri, a daughter of former president Sukarno, in October 2016 to the West Java Police. He was charged with Article 154a of the Criminal Code (KUHP) on insulting state symbols and Article 320 for defaming a dead person. The charges carry a maximum penalty of four years and four months in prison, respectively. Since his pornography case came out, Rizieq has always insisted that the profane chats were made up. He also kept pointing to the police’s reluctance to pursue the uploader of the steamy chats, which led to the pornography charges against him and Firza. Through Sugito, Rizieq released a written statement on May 16, saying that he would only fulfill his duty as a law-abiding citizen once the police had caught the “perpetrator of the mean slander via WhatsApp.” Sugito reaffirmed Rizieq’s stance once again on Monday when The Jakarta Post sought confirmation about the latter’s status of suspect. Sugito lamented that the police had not made an effort to pursue the uploader of the chats. “The investigators are being unfair and forcing their will [upon Rizieq]. Habib [Rizieq] has not even been questioned yet. They have gone too far,” said Sugito. (dea)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/30/police-name-fpi-leader-suspect-porn-case.html,,2017
"Tue, May 30 2017",Police to take action against vigilantes,"Increasingly concerning reports over the spread of vigilantes taking justice into their own hands against internet users accused of making blasphemous posts have put pressure on the National Police to take sterner action, with critics saying the force has been weak in enforcing the law on hard-liners and ensuring freedom of speech is protected. Pro-democracy groups have picked up the viral story of Fiera Lovita, a 40-year-old physician, who recently left her hometown of Solok in West Sumatra after local members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) accused her of defaming their leader Rizieq Shihab on her Facebook account last week. Instead of protecting her from the mob’s confrontation, activists said, local police “facilitated” the mob to intimidate her, force her to delete the online comments and write a letter of apology. The Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network (SAFEnet) claimed there were at least 45 social media users from across the country who had been targeted for making similar comments and threatened with being reported for violating the draconian 2016 Electronic Transaction and Information Law. National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian said on Monday that the police would investigate any mass organizations acting like vigilantes and hunting down and intimidating social media users. Regarding Fiera, Tito said he had ordered the Solok Police chief to summon FPI members suspected of intimidating the doctor. “We will see if [their actions] constitute a crime,” Tito told reporters at the Bogor State Palace in West Java. Tito said the National Police had instructed local police officers to ensure that no mass organizations intimidated people or carried out vigilante acts, saying that the right to enforce the law was solely in the hands of law enforcement agencies. Concurring with Tito, Religious Affairs Minister Lukman Hakim Saifuddin said any person involved in an act of intimidation would be subject to criminal prosecution. “If a mass organization takes issue with an action or statement made by someone, they must approach him or her to seek clarification first. If no solution is found, then the case can be settled through the legal system,” Lukman said. He added that intimidation would never be an effective way to reach a settlement. He urged all parties to refrain from intimidating others and said they should seek solutions through the judicial system. Separately, the country’s largest Islamic organization, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), has asked all mass organizations, including religion-based ones, to stop persecuting people accused of insulting religion or religious figures on the internet. NU secretary-general Helmy Faishal Zaini encouraged people to instead use dialogue to settle differences. “For us, it is clear that preaching shall be carried out in a wise way. The Quran says, ‘Ask the people to come to God’s way wisely and through good teachings.’ It even suggests to settle differences with good manners,” Helmy said. He emphasized that using intimidation and terror in dealing with differences went against the teachings of the Quran. “The Quran clearly prohibits the use of violence or terror in settling differences of opinion.” Earlier on Monday, National Police spokesperson Insp. Gen. Setyo Wasisto said intimidation toward people who allegedly committed blasphemy online could end with both parties being charged. “If people feel offended [by an online post], they can report it to the police. But vigilantism action could make them suspects, too,” Setyo added. Bonar Tigor Naipospos from human rights group Setara Institute said the Solok Police should have protected Fiera as soon as she was threatened. “The police in Solok and across Indonesia must be bold in tackling bigotry, intimidation and hate speech,” he said. Similarly, the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) has lambasted the FPI’s actions and called such behavior a threat to freedom of speech. “The arbitrary persecution carried out by the FPI violates the 1945 Constitution, which promotes and guarantees civilians’ right to assemble as well as to freely state their opinions,” AJI chairman Suwarjono said, adding that the police must take immediate action against the FPI members responsible for the incident. Contacted separately, FPI spokesperson Slamet Maarif denied that the actions in question were officially organized, saying that they were a spontaneous expression of offense. “The police should be grateful for Muslims who try to give a lesson to those who are irresponsible and defame ulema and blaspheme religion,” he said.

"Wed, May 31 2017",Commentary: Indonesian Islamists may just secure their biggest win yet,"For the more liberal Indonesians who believe Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Syihab was mostly responsible for the unjust blasphemy prosecution of then Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, the police’s decision to charge the firebrand cleric over pornography is music to their ears. Some may call it karma or divine justice or, for the Ahokers out there, sweet, sweet revenge. Rizieq has long been a thorn in the side of democracy. It is tempting to cheer the police’s move against him and wonder if this could be the beginning of the humiliating end of the FPI leader. Alas, that is just a delusion fueled by emotions and fears. Rizieq may go to jail, but his downfall is far from imminent. His legal quagmire will only make him even more popular and stronger. Here is why that would be the case. The criminal investigation into the pornography case involving Rizieq represents everything that is wrong with our legal system. It is a perfect example of our overcriminalization problem, a legal cancer that has long crippled our democracy. It is the exact same problem that has put Ahok and other people of minority groups in jail for offending the majority. Regardless of who the man is or what he has done, the case against Rizieq is preposterous. He has been charged under the 2008 Pornography Law, the enactment of which was blatantly inspired by religious fervor. The law was by design hostile to civil liberties as it blurs the line between the private and the public, as clearly evidenced by Rizieq’s case. The FPI leader is accused of spreading pornography after screenshots of steamy conversations between him and a woman on private messaging application WhatsApp were uploaded onto a dubious website. The police have yet to find the people who administered the website, but they claimed to have confiscated Rizieq’s phone and that of the woman with whom he allegedly had a sex chat and found the said conversations on them. The police also confiscated a pillow and a sheet from the bedroom of the woman accused of having the sex chats with Rizieq. This is a massive encroachment on individual privacy. If that happened to an ordinary housewife in Jakarta, everyone would and should be horrified. Who leaked the conversations? Why did the police charge a person whose personal chats got leaked? Rizieq’s case should serve as a reminder of the real problem at hand, which is more than just rising intolerance, but also and primarily bad legislation designed by power-hungry politicians to curtail our freedoms — politicians who have long been pandering to the wishes of conservative groups. The most vocal Islamist groups are now trying to move away from the fringe so they could push their agendas through legal, albeit unjust, means. While some of the FPI grassroot members are still acting like vigilantes, its elite members, including Rizieq, have vowed to stay within the law while on their so-called constitutional jihad. The key problem is that our criminal justice system is awfully flawed and the hardliners have successfully exploited it to advance their interests. The prosecution of Ahok clearly shows how powerless the law enforcers are when they are pressured to enforce a set of bad laws — including the 1965 Blasphemy Law — made by and designed according to the wishes of the majority. Alas, the hardliners are aware of the pitfalls of the legislation and they are smart enough to capitalize on them now. Unsurprisingly, Rizieq is seeking protection from the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) and the United Nations as he now believes he is a victim of a witchunt. You may call his move hypocritical and ironic (Rizieq is a major proponent of the pornography law), but he has a strong reason to challenge his prosecution, which is plagued by irregularities and alleged human rights violations. Rizieq may soon taste his own medicine, but he could now portray himself as a victim of injustice. His prosecution will only make him a martyr and embolden his sympathizers. Meanwhile, in a strange twist, most of his liberal foes, perhaps thirsty for revenge, are cheering on social media, oblivious to the fact that they are now on the same level as the FPI by supporting and justifying the use of draconian legislation, a move that will only push Indonesia away from democracy. Supporting the prosecution of Rizieq for allegedly spreading pornography, or failing to remind the police of their blunder, is not just wrong and hypocritical; it is also myopic. The police, with their poor judgment when enforcing problematic laws, are not reliable partners in fighting intolerance. Also, it is a matter of luck that President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo is on the side of tolerance. There is no guarantee he could extend his term and that his successor would not abuse those draconian laws. It is therefore baffling that most pro-democracy groups are condoning the police’s use of the draconian pornography law to charge Rizieq, as the move only serves the anti-democratic forces, including Rizieq himself. This is perhaps the biggest blow dealt to Indonesian liberals and progressives: The hard-liners have forced them to abandon their own values.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/31/commentary-indonesian-islamists-may-just-secure-their-biggest-win-yet.html,,2017
"Fri, June 2 2017",Activists offer protection to victims,"A video showing a 15-year-old boy being intimidated and harassed by several men claiming to be members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) for allegedly insulting their fugitive leader, Rizieq Shihab, went viral on Thursday, the day the nation celebrated the birth of Pancasila. In the video, the men can be seen coercing the boy, who is of Chinese descent, to sign a statement of apology for slandering Rizieq, who was recently named a suspect in a pornography case. The boy’s hands shook while he held the paper. “You better tell your friends of your ethnicity to never do it again,” one man said. The man tells the teenager that Rizieq is respected by the whole Muslim community. Another man is later seen slapping the boy’s mouth two times. East Jakarta Police Chief, Sr. Comr. Andry Wibowo said the police were now investigating the incident, while FPI spokesperson, Slamet Maarif, said his organization planned to file libel charges against the boy. “His written apology is not valid.” The video is part of a systematic campaign by hard-line Islamist groups to intimidate social media users accused of insulting Islam and clerics, said Damar Juniarto, the regional coordinator for the Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network (SAFEnet). Damar said the campaign had four stages. First, the perpetrators tracked targets and spread their identities on the web. Second, they instructed the masses to hunt the targets. Third, the targets are forced to apologize in front of a camera. Fourth, the targets are reported to the police for defamation. According to SAFEnet’s data, the campaign started in January, but the number of cases spiked after former Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama was found guilty of blasphemy on May 9. “Our data show that there have been 59 cases until May, and most cases are occurred in May,” he said. Previously, Fiera Lovita, a 40-year-old physician at the Solok Regional Public Hospital in Padang, West Sumatra, also made headlines after being intimidated by local FPI members. “I was about to go home from the hospital when suddenly my car was surrounded by people with white robes. They tapped my car window and asked me to step out of the car. I was so scared because my kids were in the car,” she said. Damar said SAFEnet was focusing on finding ways to stop the persecution by tracking people that could be targeted. “The difficulty lies in preempting these organizations before they persecute the victims because out network is not as large as theirs.” The Anti-Persecution Coalition has set up a crisis center to counsel persecution victims. The police have said they would take action against those who took the law into their own hands.

"Fri, June 2 2017",Police struggle to track down Rizieq,"In late January, Indonesians were shocked by a website named baladacintarizieq.com, which displayed screenshots of WhatsApp messenger conversations that allegedly took place between notorious Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab and Firza Husein, a treason suspect and the coordinator of Solidaritas Sahabat Cendana, a foundation linked to the family of former president Soeharto. The Anti-Pornography Student Alliance reported the website to the Jakarta Police on Jan. 31 for spreading profane content. But since then, the police have struggled to pinpoint Rizieq’s whereabouts. Rizieq has twice evaded police questioning, on April 25 and May 10. According to FPI lawyer Kapitra Ampera, Rizieq left the country to go to Saudi Arabia on a minor pilgrimage on April 27. Meanwhile, the police arrested Firza on May 16 after she underwent 12 hours of interrogation. Even after the police named Rizieq a suspect on Monday, they are still facing difficulties apprehending him. Police visits to his house and the Immigration Office have confirmed that he has fled the country and has yet to return. “Police investigators visited Rizieq’s neighborhood and asked his community unit head and his neighbors about his whereabouts, but to no avail,” Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Argo Yuwono told reporters on Thursday. Based on their findings, the Jakarta Police proceeded on Wednesday to put Rizieq on the police’s most-wanted list, said Argo. Rizieq’s lawyer, Sugito Atmo Prawiro, has confirmed repeatedly that his client is still abroad. Sugito claimed that on the same day Rizieq was named a suspect, Rizieq was in Saudi Arabia. The lawyer said again on Thursday that he was still there. While it has been confirmed that Rizieq has not returned to the country, Jakarta Police legal division head Sr. Comr. Agus Rohmat said the police were still holding back from requesting Interpol to issue a red notice on Rizieq. “We are still maximizing our own efforts to capture Rizieq. What we have done so far is put him on our wanted list,” said Agus. “The Jakarta Police have begun cooperating with the National Police’s Criminal Investigation Department and International Relations department to locate him.” Law and Human Rights Ministry immigration director general Ronny Franky Sompie said he would cooperate with Jakarta Police deputy chief Brig. Gen. Suntana in bringing Rizieq home. “The Immigration Office does not have the power to force someone to come home, but we can revoke a citizen’s passport in order to push them to undergo legal procedures in Indonesia,” Ronny said as quoted by tribunnews.com. Furthermore, five months into the case, Argo said the police had not succeeded in finding the uploader of the steamy WhatsApp chats. “We have explained this over and over again. Of course we are investigating it,” he said. “The internet is linked to anonymity. It is not limited by time and geographic borders. Until today, we still haven’t found the uploader [for the aforementioned reasons] but we will do our best to investigate the origin of this story even though we will not reveal the methods [to the public].” (dea)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/06/02/police-struggle-track-down-rizieq.html,,2017
"Fri, June 2 2017",Listening to ‘sholawat’ to combat radical Islam,"On Metro TV’s Mata Najwa Wednesday night, Najwa Shihab facilitated a rich discussion with several leaders of governmental and political organizations on the current problems of radicalism in Indonesia. The roundtable provided valuable insight into the way radicalism enters schools and the steps that institutions like the Culture and Education Ministry are taking to combat radicalism. The conversation was enlightening on several fronts, but I want to focus on a response by Muhaimin Iskandar, the chairman of National Awakening Party (PKB), as to why the youth are being radicalized. “Syekhermania, all of Syekhermania are young. Every night around 30,000 people arrive to every event. Before they begin, they sing the Indonesian national anthem first. Their doctrine from ‘Habib’ Syech emphasizes nationalism, humanism and pluralism. Why doesn’t the government expose them, why aren’t they promoted, supported, and encouraged?” Muhaimin said. Much of the conversations during the discussion as well as in the Western news sources revolve around the recent gatherings organized by Islam Defender Front (FPI), the blasphemy trial of outgoing Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, the caning of homosexuals and the recent bombing in Jakarta. However, Muhaimin’s question is worth considering more closely. Syekhermania is an organization that assists with facilitating the huge, 10,000-70,000, performances of sholawat (devotional songs) by the Surakarta-born “Habib” Syech bin Abdul Qadir Assegaf across Indonesia as well as Malaysia, Taiwan and China. The events are alive with stage lighting, huge speakers and the smell of perfume. Members of Syekhermania can be spotted wearing jackets with Syechermania across the back and white skull caps. The organization does have a large number of youth, but people from all different backgrounds and ages are a part of Syekhermania. With such a large following, the question remains, why not make Syekhermania and these events more prominent in the public vision of Indonesia? When Syech was first asked about the formation of Syekhermania, he had a few requirements, but the most prominent is that it cannot be political. By political, Syech meant that it could not promote a particular political party or become an active party in local or national elections. This does not mean that politicians and political parties do not support the events. Local officials are almost always present at the events, but the events are designed to be performances of sholawat. Additionally, Syech actively seeks to stay out of politics. If he gives any sort of sermon, it is often a reminder to stay away from drugs, alcohol and sexual activity. The picture of this organization, however, becomes complicated when you consider the variety of Islamic organizations in Indonesia and Syekhermania’s relationship with them. In one of the most popular songs, “Padang Bulan”, the phrase, “Syekhermania NU [Nahdlatul Ulama],” provides insight into the Islamic affiliation of many who arrive. The government may not want to overtly support an event that seems to coincide too closely with NU, but many members of Syekhermania identify themselves as Muhammadiyah as well as FPI. Hard-line FPI leader Rizieq Shihab made several appearances in Syekhermania events before his trip to Mecca, which might worry the government. In fact, the government has questioned Syech’s closeness with Rizieq, but the latter’s presence at these events does not necessarily indicate that Syech agrees to the philosophy of Rizieq. In Syech’s words, “I know sholawat, and I do not want to enter the business of politics.” To combat both the image of radicalism in the Western media and the growing concerns in Indonesia around radicalism, we must encourage and bring to light organizations such as Syekhermania, who might not wield enormous political power but indicate how thousands of Muslims across Indonesia and elsewhere are living Islamically in the world. Perhaps it is time to listen more closely to the sounds of sholawat than to the voices of those who have the most political power. ______________________________ The writer is a PhD student at Arizona State University working on the anthropology of religion and contemporary Indonesian Islamic movements.

"Sat, June 3 2017",Support mounts for teenager allegedly bullied by FPI,"Following an alleged act of persecution by a group claiming to be members of hard-line Muslim organization Islam Defenders Front (FPI) toward PMA, a 15-year-old boy who posted a Facebook message allegedly insulting FPI leader and firebrand cleric Rizieq Shihab, the government and activists have declared their support for PMA and have urged the Jakarta Police to proceed with the case. The case came into the spotlight on Thursday when a video that went viral on the internet showed PMA being intimidated and harassed by a group of men. The men accused him of having mocked Rizieq through his Facebook account and asked PMA to sign a statement of apology for slandering Rizieq. One of the men told the teenager that Rizieq, who was recently named a suspect in a pornography case, was respected by the whole Muslim community. Another man is later seen slapping the boy’s mouth two times. The East Jakarta Police later arrested two men in the video. They are identified only by the initials of AM, 22, and M. Both suspects are residents of Cipinang Muara, East Jakarta, where the incident took place. The police have confirmed AN to be a member of the FPI. According to Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Argo Yuwono, PMA did not write the Facebook status himself but copied it from another source. “After he published the copied words, someone on Facebook messaged him about his status and then asked him to meet in person,” said Argo. “Turns out it was a set-up to frame PMA. He was later herded into a nearby community unit office and the rest went as recorded on the video.” Argo said AM and M would be charged with Article 80 of Law No. 35/2014 regarding child protection, which carries a maximum prison sentence of three years and six months. Besides the two suspects, the Jakarta Police have also questioned five witnesses who were present at the site of the incident. Following the incident, PMA has received assistance from several institutions, including the Women’s Empowerment and Child Protection Ministry, GP Ansor, the young wing of Indonesia’s largest Muslim organization the Nahdlatul Ulama, and the Indonesian Child Protection Commission (KPAI). Neneng Heryani from the ministry’s social protection house for children said the ministry had moved PMA, his mother and his six younger siblings to a safe house. “We are going to check on his physical and mental health and also help him out of his trauma,” said Neneng. “Most importantly, we will ensure that PMA and his siblings will be able to attend school as usual.” KPAI commissioner Erlinda Iswanto said that mass persecution, especially against underage children, could not be justified in any way. “What I see is a form of arrogance shown by certain members of an organization to someone who just wanted to voice his opinion,” she said. Erlinda said the KPAI would represent PMA during any necessary legal procedures as she had heard about certain parties planning to report PMA to the police for the latter’s Facebook status. “We appreciate the Jakarta Police’s efforts to safeguard the boy after the incident. We will discuss with the police which articles we should charge his persecutors with,” she said. Meanwhile, GP Ansor’s Jakarta branch secretary Dendy Zuhairil said his organization reported the video to the Jakarta Police as soon as they got hold of it. “We will defend PMA as he undergoes legal procedures with the police,” said Dendy. “We would like to emphasize that Indonesia is a lawful country and therefore, if certain groups are offended by something, they should not persecute anyone.” (dea)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/06/03/support-mounts-teenager-allegedly-bullied-fpi.html,,2017
"Sat, June 3 2017",Persecuting children,"Children are precious, which is why Indonesia ratified a United Nation convention on the rights of the child, passing legislation to recognize their rights and protect them from all forms of danger. However, shocking cases of intimidation and physical abuse against a 15-year-old East Jakarta boy of Chinese descent by a group of men, including those claiming to be members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), and cyber bullying targeting a female high school graduate of East Java, clearly show that the set of regulations are toothless in the face of enraged adults. Afi Nihaya Faradisa, a resident of the town of Banyuwangi, has demonstrated maturity beyond her years in the way she criticizes how children are taught supremacy of their religion over others, which she says is the root cause of conflicts in Indonesia while the country is destined to be a diverse nation. For many adults who follow her Facebook account, her way of thinking is progressive and maintains Indonesia’s hope of preserving its pluralist nature. Many others, however, lash out at her “deviant” thoughts and tell her to go back to the scripture, learn from authoritative Islamic teachers or simply repent. “Nobody doubts the power of God. He could have created us all the same. Similar faces, religion and nation. But it did not happen,” she said in one of her postings, which immediately went viral. The cyber bullying seemed to reflect adults’ inability to accept criticism by a female teenager, especially on religion. Still, Afi is fortunate enough to have escaped physical intimidation, unlike the East Jakarta boy who was seen in video footage undergoing interrogation by people who could not accept his online postings. That he finally wrote a statement to confess his guilt of having insulted FPI leader Rizieq Shihab, who is wanted by the police in a pornography case, and ulema, is understandable as he came under extraordinary pressure. The boy, identified only as PMA, his mother and siblings are now under the Jakarta Police’s protection following the incident. The police have also arrested two of his intimidators. National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian promised to enforce the law against whoever takes the law into their own hand as in the persecution cases. The police have earlier evacuated a doctor, another victim of persecution, and her family from Solok regency in West Sumatra to Jakarta for safety after local FPI members intimidated her for her criticism of Rizieq on her Facebook account. Credit should go to the police, albeit partially because their negligence or reluctance to act against violent groups in the past has resulted in impunity — today the same groups or others intimidate vulnerable people like children, women and minorities. Had persecution against Ahmadis, Shiites, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) people and other minority groups landed the perpetrators in court, hence jail, we may have not seen the children fall prey to the crimes.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/06/03/persecuting-children.html,,2017
"Mon, June 5 2017",Chinese festival unfazed by racial sentiment,"Row, row, row your boat: Participants competing in a dragon boat race head toward the finish line on the Cisadane River in Tangerang, Banten, on Saturday. The competition, part of the annual Chinese Peh Cun Festival, symbolizes the efforts of their ancestors to look for the body of Qu Yuan, the minister of Chu state.(JP/Fachrul Sidiq) Despite rising anti-Chinese sentiment, hundreds of people flocked to the riverbank of Cisadane River on Jl. Kali Pasir in Tangerang, Banten, to cheer on participants of the dragon boat race during the Peh Cun traditional Chinese festival on Saturday. The race, in which participants pedaled their boats to get to the finish line as quick as possible, was the most anticipated part of the festival, which literally means “to sail a boat” and is celebrated by people of Chinese descent to commemorate the minister and poet Qu Yuan of the Chu state. The race comprises two categories; dragon boats and papak boat. The former features 17-meter-long boats adorned with dragon decorations, while the later has no decorations. Each of the 16 participating teams consist of 25 members competing head-to-head in the race. The winning teams advance to the next round, up to the grand final stage. “This tradition has been carried out since 1910 and the enthusiasm of the people to participate and witness the celebration remains high,” said 52-year-old Djoni Tjiawi, who servers as an adviser to the organizing committee of the festival. He pointed out that in 2015, only 11 teams participated in the race. Prior to the festival, Djoni said, the organizers had established good communication with influential figures in the region, including Muslim clerics and state officials to ensure the event ran smoothly. Last Tuesday, the festival’s organizers held a breaking-of-the-fast gathering, inviting locals in their attempt to show respect toward Muslims. Tangerang Mayor Arief R. Wismansyah attended the event, Djoni said. The final stage of the dragon boat race was held on Sunday. A food bazaar and Chinese calligraphy demonstration and exhibition were also held to enliven the celebration. Adi, 26, the team leader of Wu Shi Jin Shan, which means dragon from the golden mountain, said he sensed growing anti-Chinese sentiment, particularly after the divisive Jakarta gubernatorial election. However, he said he enjoyed the tradition as a means to strengthen ties among residents in the area, irrespective of their ethnicity or religion. Adi’s team was the defending champion of the competition and as of Saturday, his team had reached the semifinal round in this year’s race. “Our team comprises members from different faiths and ethnicities, including Muslims and Chinese. We have good teamwork, as we’ve been preparing for this competition for several months,” said Adi. The Jakarta election saw the identity of the incumbent candidate, Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, who is a Christian of Chinese descent, exploited by his political opponents. Ahok was eventually sent to prison for insulting Islam after commenting on a Quranic verse he believed had been used by his political opponents to influence people to vote against him. Hundreds of thousands of conservative Muslims, led by Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader and firebrand cleric Rizieq Shihab, held two large-scale rallies last year, which were considered to be among the biggest mobilizations in the country’s history. A 15-year-old boy of Chinese descent was reportedly persecuted and intimidated by people who claimed to be members of the FPI in East Jakarta. In a viral video on Thursday, the boy was slapped by a man and coerced to apologize for allegedly insulting Rizieq, who has been named a suspect in a number of cases. Another man in the video is seen telling the boy to remind his ethnic Chinese friends to “respect” Rizieq. The traditions of Peh Cun have been preserved since 1910, however were banned during the New Order Era under then president Soeharto. The festival resumed in the early 2000s after the downfall of the authoritarian regime.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/06/05/chinese-festival-unfazed-racial-sentiment.html,,2017

Rizieq’s lawyer, Kapitra Ampera, has disseminated the information in pamphlets that read, “Muslims wait for the return of their high preacher, who will finally return on the 17th day of Ramadhan. Great historical events such as the Battle of Badr, Battle of Tabuk [...] and Indonesian proclamation happened during Ramadhan. We are waiting for the 17th day of Ramadhan.” FPI spokesperson Slamet Maarif confirmed the information on Saturday. “[Rizieq] will probably come back on the 17th day of Ramadhan,” he said as quoted by tempo.co.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/06/04/greater-jakarta-rizieq-return-indonesia-mid-june.html,,2017
"Tue, June 6 2017",MUI issues how-to guide to make social media great again,"With social media increasingly turning into a platform for hate and bigotry, the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) on Monday issued a guide for Muslims in the country on how to responsibly use the medium. In the 20-page guide, which takes the form of a fatwa (edict), the MUI forbade Muslims from spreading hate speech, slanderous statements, hoaxes, pornographic material and racial slurs, which it deemed haram (forbidden under Islamic law). “While communicating on social media, Muslims must consider the action as part of efforts to promote iman [faith] and ketakwaan [piety] instead of kufur [infidelity] and maksiat [sin],” the MUI said. The body also declared in the edict that it was also haram for Muslims to take the job of a social media “buzzer” whose work is to distribute hoaxes, slanderous accusations and fake news for personal economic gain. “We also proscribe Muslims from [...] supporting and taking advantage of the profession of social media buzzer,” the edict said. MUI chairman Ma’ruf Amin officially handed over the fatwa to Communications and Information Minister Rudiantara in a ceremony on Monday and expressed hope that the guideline could be used as reference for a cyber-security team at the ministry to prosecute any offenders. Ma’ruf said that although the edict was nonbinding, he expected Muslims in Indonesia to abide by it. The MUI chairman said that the council took the initiative after getting complaints that the effects of fake news and hate speech on social media had worsened in recent months. “The problems of social media have become so serious that President Jokowi made repeated calls for people to stop themselves from spreading hate speech on social media. This is why the MUI stepped in to provide a solution for the nation,” Ma’ruf said. Ma’ruf also said that the MUI decided to take action following reports of a surge in cases of vigilantism, which involved social media users being targeted by hard-line Muslim organizations for allegedly posting statements deemed slanderous to Islam or Muslim clerics. Last week, Fiera Lovita, 40, a physician at Solok Regional Hospital, received police protection after being harassed by members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) after she posted statements on Facebook criticizing FPI leader Rizieq Shihab for fleeing the country after being named a suspect in a pornography case. Also last week, a 15-year-old boy of Chinese descent in Cipinang Muara, East Jakarta, was subjected to intimidation and violence by alleged supporters of the FPI after posting statements on Facebook that could be interpreted as making fun of Rizieq. Responding to the MUI’s move, Rudiantara said that the fatwa could encourage the ministry to step up its monitoring of incendiary rhetoric on social media. “This is a breath of fresh air for us at the ministry. This could support our work in containing the spread of negative content and hate speech on the internet. The fatwa will be used as a reference for our team, which also has a representative at the MUI, to determine whether to block something on the internet,” Rudiantara said. Rudiantara said the ministry would also work with the National Police to bring criminal charges against netizens who spread hatred and slander on social media.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/06/06/mui-issues-how-guide-make-social-media-great-again.html,,2017
"Wed, June 7 2017",The netizens’ fatwa,"A new fatwa (edict) from the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) should help make cyberspace a nicer place — it is just about basic decency and honesty, which all religions preach. But decency and honesty on the internet is not so simple given temptations to click away one’s thoughts and expressions in seconds; whether they are personal or related to, for instance, political campaigns. Developed by the global online community since 1995, netizens have “netiquette”, or etiquette on the internet. Guidelines remind us that although conversations can take place in real time, the parties involved do not know the tone of one’s voice or body language; joking may be confused for serious accusations. Yet Indonesians nevertheless faced increased risks of standing trial on charges of defamation under the controversial Electronic Information and Transactions Law. Heated exchanges occurred particularly around the Jakarta gubernatorial election period. Therefore the fatwa on interaction on social media should have been issued much earlier. But better late than never, before many more Muslims ruin their fast by gossiping and engaging in overheated debates — including presumed tension between acting Jakarta governor Djarot Saiful Hidayat and the transition team of governor-elect Anies Baswedan, to arguments on valid prayers to break the fast. As a semi-state body in a non-religious state the MUI rulings are non-binding, but serve as guidance for Indonesian Muslims. A fatwa on internet conduct is fitting following much distress among friends and family facing hateful remarks, and signals of “unfriending” or “leave group.” Most shocking were recent incidents of “digital vigilantism.” Vigilantes tracked down social account owners who had posted remarks that apparently offended them; even a boy in East Jakarta was intimidated and slapped by alleged supporters of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Police arrested two men for child abuse, and National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian dismissed the Solok Police chief in West Sumatra for failing to protect a physician who faced intimidation following her Facebook posts on FPI leader, Rizieq Shihab. The police and the MUI may have been whipped into action following President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s warning against people taking the law into their own hands. Among the MUI guidelines are that the information to be spread must be verified for accuracy and context; it further urges efforts to prevent and delete information known to be inaccurate. The fatwa cites Quranic verses that warn against lying and cursing, for instance, which Muslims learned about as children. But because too many have forgotten their early lessons, the fatwa also urges religious figures to set good examples of social media use in addition to recommending wider public education on the issue.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/06/07/the-netizens-fatwa.html,,2017
"Thu, June 29 2017","‘Islami’, Islamist, Islam: Ahok, FPI and the rest of us Muslims","S ometimes in life the smallest of things can make the biggest of differences. This applies also to words. Take the word Islami . Derived from the word “Islam,” in Indonesian the addition of an “i” at the end gives it the meaning of “having Islamic characteristics or values.” You don’t even have to be Muslim - if you are morally upright, honest, courageous, tolerant, compassionate and forgiving, if you fight for truth and justice, care about others’ welfare and actually do something about it, then you would be considered Islami . A striking example of an Islami person in Indonesia is in fact a non-Muslim: a Chinese-Indonesian Christian named Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama whose birthday — his 51 st — happens to be today. Yes, I am talking about the now incarcerated former governor of Jakarta. Through his programs, he defended the rights and interests of the poor and marginalized; he raised people’s salaries to a decent level; he created and improved facilities for all Jakarta residents, cleaning rivers and canals that had been filthy and clogged for decades; he was a fearless crusader — or should I say jihadist? — against corruption, which is why he was so hated by many in the establishment. He closed the infamous Kalijodo prostitution complex and turned it into an entertainment park for Jakarta residents. He built many mosques, sent people on umrah (minor haj) and regularly gave large amounts of alms. How many Muslims can claim to have done all that? Yet, he was accused of blasphemy and sentenced to two years in prison. That’s peanuts compared to the 27 years South African activist Nelson Mandela had to endure. Hang in there Ahok! It will just add to your stature as an inspirational leader as it did for Mandela. Okay, back to words. If you add an “s” and “t” to Islami , turning the word into “Islamist,” the meaning becomes the reverse. Islamists, i.e. those who subscribe to Islamism, which is an extremist, often violent ideology, are the exact opposite of the peaceful spirit of Islam. They simply hijack Islam for their own power, political, or ideological interests. These groups exist worldwide as, among others, al-Qaeda, the Islamic State (IS) movement, Hamas and Hezbollah and in Indonesia as the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and the Hizbut Thahrir Indonesia (HTI). During Ramadhan, FPI vigilantes would conduct sweeping raids of restaurants, cafes and night life venues that they suspect were guilty of “immoral activities” and should be closed. It’s bad, but mild compared to the acts of terrorism in many other parts of the world that claim the lives of many, including Muslims. If the majority of Muslims see Ramadhan as a time for spiritual reflection and purification, extremist groups see it as a time to step up militancy. “Ramadhan is the holy month of jihad,” an IS supporter tweeted. For them, martyrdom is an ultimate goal and suicide bombings and terrorist attacks fall into the category of “good acts.” Sick or what!? So clearly, Islami people and Islamists are at the opposite ends of a normal curve and the majority of Muslims like you and me are in the middle. Three days after Idul Fitri let’s ask ourselves: Where do we fall in the curve? Indonesia has 230 million people (about 87 percent of the population) who profess in varying degrees to be Muslim, but those who are truly Islami are very small in number. Most Muslims condemn fundamentalists and their acts of terrorism, but they themselves act like the fundamentalists. The reason is because most Muslims don’t critically study their religion and have a superficial or even distorted view of Islam. They just accept what is handed down to them by family, friends and ulema, many of whom take a literalist view of Islam. The result is blind belief, so when they are presented with a different, or opposing point of view, they resort to insults, bad behavior and, yes, violence. Religion is also used as a means of control and manipulation. As Ibnu Rushd aka Averroes, a Spanish philosopher, says: “If you want to control ignorant people, then present a falsehood from a religious outlook.” In my neighborhood, the local Betawi people traditionally supported Ahok, but when they were approached by extremists who threatened them, saying that if they voted for Ahok they would go to hell, they believed it. Hah! Only in Indonesia can heaven or hell be determined by who you chose at the voting booth. Superficiality, ignorance and materialism dominate many aspects of our modern lives and religion is no exception. Religion is a political commodity — that’s well known — but it is also a commodity for ordinary people who use it as a way to compensate for, or balance-out their very materialistic and actually egotistical, non-caring selves. They make a big display of wearing so-called Muslim garb (actually, Arab-inspired), giving alms to the poor, collecting funds to provide scholarships for children of poor families, and even setting up pesantren (Islamic boarding schools). In short, these are socially visible show-off activities. That’s all well and good, but then privately they project their negativity — insecurity, jealousy, greed, indifference, etc. — onto family members or close friends in an uncaring or even aggressive and discriminatory manner. So, they use religion as compensation or a mask to cover up their crippled spiritual selves. Hypocrisy abounds, which creates a very unhealthy society. “The problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts.” I love this quote by Bertrand Russell, which I think is so apposite in the context of Muslims. One of the memes that went viral just after Ahok was imprisoned was a play on his name: Yang kalian penjarakan Purnama, bukan cahayanya (What you are incarcerating is Purnama — Ahok’s last name, which means moon — not its rays). Cahaya, the modern spelling of Ahok’s middle name, means “light.” Basically it means you can imprison the body, but the spirit remains free and may shine even more brightly. In Islam there is the belief that if you are unjustly persecuted, you will get an even higher award, if not in this life, then in the next. To Islami people, this means a lot. Muslims also believe that “Patient people always win; greedy people always suffer losses; angry people always lose; good people are always tested.” I have a feeling that Ahok subscribes to this belief. Do you? _______________________________________________ The writer is the author of Julia’s Jihad .",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/06/29/islami-islamist-islam-ahok-fpi-and-rest-us-muslims.html,,2017
"Thu, June 29 2017",Jokowi’s meeting with GNPF-MUI triggers mixed signals,"Over the nearly three years of his presidency, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has maintained ties with moderate Muslim groups by visiting Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah-affiliated Islamic boarding schools and clerics during working trips across the archipelago. Hence, many were surprised when Jokowi received seven representatives of the conservative Islamic group the National Movement to Safeguard the Indonesian Ulema Council’s Fatwa (GNPF-MUI) during the Idul Fitri celebration at Merdeka Palace on Sunday. Jokowi was accompanied by Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Wiranto and Religious Affairs Minister Lukman Hakim Saifuddin. Among those from GNPF-MUI were firebrand cleric and GNPF-MUI chairman Bachtiar Nasir, deputy chairman Zaitun Rusmin and spokesman Kapitra Ampera. A day before, the group’s leaders held an introductory meeting with the two ministers to convey their wish to communicate with the President. Analysts believe the move was part of Jokowi’s attempt to ease tensions between the government and hard-line groups and to prevent political disturbances caused by large demonstrations. Others link the move to Jokowi’s likely bid for reelection in 2019 and view it as an attempt to woo conservative voters. But some have also expressed concerns the meeting could give a false signal that may embolden hard-line groups to commit intolerant acts. Conservative groups including GNPF-MUI and hard-liners Islam Defenders Front (FPI) have become staunch critics of Jokowi’s administration, especially after they mobilized a series of large rallies demanding the prosecution of former Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahja Purnama, a Christian of Chinese descent, for blasphemy. Ahok, now in prison, was Jokowi’s deputy when the latter served as Jakarta governor from 2012 to 2014. Jokowi has repeatedly called for all parties to refrain from conducting mass rallies, which he has described as a “waste of energy.” State Secretary Pratikno said the meeting was initiated by the GNPF-MUI and that the President “welcomes anyone to the State Palace during [Idul Fitri] open house.” “[GNPF-MUI] said, ‘We want to get direct access to communicate with the President,’” Pratikno said, quoting the group of representatives from the 20-minute closed door meeting. During a press conference on Tuesday, Bachtiar said the group expressed concerns to the President about “discrimination against Muslims.” Bachtiar was referring to the pornography charges the police have slapped on FPI leader and firebrand cleric Rizieq Shihab, as well as several other clerics, such as firebrand Muhammad Al Khaththath, who have been arrested over treason allegations. “We came [to the State Palace] to tell the President the truth and we hope he will listen to us,” Bachtiar said. While the treason suspects are now in custody, Rizieq had flown to Saudi Arabia before the police put him on their wanted list. Rizieq has refused to return home and expected the meeting between the GNPF-MUI and Jokowi to put a stop to the case, Bachtiar said. “Before the meeting, we also coordinated with Rizieq,” he said. National Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Martinus Sitompul assured that the police would not stop their investigations into the clerics. “The legal process will continue. We will stick to the law in completing our investigation,” Martinus told The Jakarta Post on Wednesday. State Islamic University (UIN) political expert Adi Prayitno said Jokowi’s decision to embrace Islamic groups such as GNPF-MUI would help the government maintain stability. The meeting also helps counter rumors labelling Jokowi as “anti Islam.” However, Adi said Jokowi should ignore the group’s wish to end the prosecution of the clerics. He also said the meeting could embolden hardline and intolerant groups. “If after the meeting hardliners commit more intolerant acts, Jokowi should just let the police deal with them,” he said, adding that Jokowi would risk losing support from moderate Islamic groups if he was perceived as bowing down to the hardliners’ pressures.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/06/29/jokowi-s-meeting-with-gnpf-mui-triggers-mixed-signals.html,,2017
"Tue, August 22 2017","As inauguration approaches, Anies wants change in FPI","Call it ironic. But Jakarta governor-elect Anies Baswedan made it clear to the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), a main driver of a string of sectarian rallies surrounding the recent Jakarta election, that he wanted the group to be a guardian of pluralism. Just two months before his inauguration, the former education minister, who rode on the wave of the country’s Islamic conservatism to win the poll, attended an anniversary gathering of the group and told it to improve its image, which is usually associated with intolerance and against diversity. “I want to reiterate what I said before, that from now on, the FPI must prove itself as an organization that serves as a guardian of the country’s diversity,” Anies said in his speech on Saturday. The FPI and other conservative Muslim groups held more than five rallies to protest statements from Basuki “Ahok” Tjahja Purnama, the first Christian of Chinese descent to become the governor of Jakarta who was also seeking reelection at the time. Ahok lost the election to Anies and was sentenced to two years in prison for blasphemy. Mostly trailing behind Ahok in electability during the election season, Anies, who gained a reputation for being a moderate Muslim scholar, chose to form an alliance with the FPI during his campaign. Months since the election, Anies is at a crossroads on whether to continue to support the hard-line group, which also conducted a series of raids on civilians they considered to have slandered their leader, Rizieq Shihab. The firebrand cleric was derided after he fled to Saudi Arabia during a police investigation into a pornography case in which he was implicated. Rizieq has been named a suspect for his alleged steamy chats with Firza Husein, a collaborator in the rallies, that have spread on the internet. By continuing his support for the group, Anies may risk severing ties with wider parts of society and hurt the image of the capital of the largest country in Southeast Asia that has prided itself for promoting tolerance. Although Anies said he could ensure that the FPI would not be a threatening organization, and would protect the mandate of Pancasila, many doubt his commitment. “Jakarta governor must be the governor of all and not only certain group of people,” Gun Gun Heryanto from the Political Literacy Institute told The Jakarta Post on Monday. Gun hoped Anies would distance himself from the group after his inauguration in October. State Islamic University (UIN) political expert Adi Prayitno said Anies displaying a warm relationship with the FPI would not help mend divisions in the city following the election. The minority, he said, would feel intimidated with Anies’ closeness to the FPI. “If this relationship continues, it will threaten pluralism in Jakarta,” Adi said. Novel Bamukmin, the FPI’s Jakarta chapter secretary-general and staunch supporter of Rizieq, said accusations that the group was intolerant were nonsense, as the group supported unity and diversity in the country. “From now until forever we will fight together to maintain the nation’s diversity because Islam is a blessing for the universe,” he said. He only hoped that no more ulemas and Muslim activists were criminalized because they had defended the nation from colonialism, communists and those who offended religion.

"Thu, September 7 2017",Religious supremacy and our silence,"It was inspiring to see thousands of people staging vigils and peaceful rallies   in Charlottesville in the United States to pay tribute to those killed during the violence instigated by white supremacists on Aug.12th in the Virginian city. One day after the deadly riot, reports said 500 rallies were planned across the US. Despite US President Donald Trump’s display of indecisiveness, the outraged American public clearly and loudly denounced the act of white supremacy, together affirming that bigotry and racism are against American values. By contrast, in a country dubbed the world’s third-largest democracy, religious supremacism, bigotry and persecution are left almost unchallenged. The spirit of collectively condemning religious supremacism does not exist in Indonesia, a nation claiming to be harmonious amid ethnic and cultural diversity. In fact, most Indonesians stay silent, if not fearful, of ultra-conservative groups aiming to enforce their beliefs on others. Putra Mario Alfian, a 15-year old boy from Tangerang, Banten, was abused by a number of people in May after posting a Facebook status and image deemed offensive to Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab. After being forced to make a written apology to the leader, he and his family were eventually forced out of their rented house by the landlord. Fiera Lovita, a general practitioner, left her hometown in Solok, West Sumatra, after being intimidated and terrorized following her Facebook comment criticizing the FPI leader. Fiera had commented on Rizieq’s fugitive status after police named him a suspect in a pornography case. The Solok Police chief was later dismissed, reportedly because of her inability to protect the victim. The long list of religious superiority actions continues, with houses of worship being vandalized and burned, as in Tanjung Balai, North Sumatra, where a mob burned down pagodas and monasteries in mid-2016. In October 2015, two churches in Aceh Singkil, Aceh, deemed illegal by locals, were set alight, forcing thousands to flee their homes. There is also continuous persecution of Shiites and followers of the Ahmadiyah minority. Amid all this, most Indonesians have been silent. Condemnation came from the Anshor Youth Movement (GP Anshor, an Islamic group) and rights activists. However, the fact remains that 59 recorded cases of persecution from January to May this year alone, according to the South East Asia Freedom of Expression Network (SAFEnet), have not ignited the public to stand up together to defend basic values of our democracy: Diversity and tolerance. We seem to succumb to extremism and religious supremacy, noisy only on social media when seeing ultra-conservatives raiding food stalls and restaurants during the fasting month of Ramadhan. Sadly, extremists are even used for political gains by opportunist politicians, as seen in the Jakarta gubernatorial election. Indeed, police took stern action to safeguard restaurants against raids in Depok, West Java, during Ramadhan and prevented the FPI from raiding a supermarket in Sragen, Central Java, over the use of Christmas attributes last December. Yet, much more needs to be done. As stated by National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian late last year in the wake of massive rallies against then-Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, in taking firm action against extreme intolerant groups: Police need both constitutional legitimacy and public legitimacy. The scholar Testriono has argued that police need strong support in acting against such groups, because first, they worry they would appear to be defying Islam. Second, firm action against religious leaders and their followers will create political instability and hinder the police’s duty in maintaining stability. Together, we must loudly give the public legitimacy the police needs, for our own sake. According to a study by the Wahid Foundation, 11 million people are willing to conduct radical and violent acts in the name of religion. Conducted in April and May 2016, the study, meanwhile, found that 72 percent of the 1,520 respondents surveyed opposed radical acts. This, according to the foundation’s director Yenny Wahid, represents the majority of Indonesian Muslims. In a nation of more than 250 million people, 11.5 million extremists and others prone to violence are a small portion of the population. Yet the majority of tolerant Indonesians tends to remain silent. German political scientist Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann in 1974 cited “the spiral of silence.” She explained silence by the minority against the majority reflected fears of isolation and more severe consequences — violence, loss of jobs, legal consequences, etc. Thus, minority members try to find out what the majority opinion is, speaking out when they believe they share the dominant opinion, but remaining silent when they think their opinion is only that of a minority. However, tolerant Indonesians are the majority here, yet remain powerless and voiceless toward bigotry and intolerance. If we, tolerant Indonesians are the majority, why should we feel powerless against the bigoted, noisy minority? Some actions can be taken to fight religious supremacy. The government must single out any group aiming at undermining our sense of unity in diversity. Firm legal action must be brought to bear on those committing persecution, intimidation or violence against minority groups in the name of religion. Denunciation and concrete action are also needed from major religious institutions like the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah, if we want our very basic principle of Unity in Diversity to prevail. The use of radicalism or intimidation and violence based on extreme and intolerant beliefs for political gains must be stopped. As for the public, we need to speak out more often and louder and shake up the current atmosphere allowing a vast public space for extremists. Strong denunciation through concerted peaceful rallies, public discussions, strong public statements by opinion leaders, peaceful religious sermons and online-offline campaigns on religious radicalism and bigotry are critical. The media also need to consistently make it clear that religious supremacy has no place in this country. Known for their political alliances, Indonesian media organizations must make tolerance and diversity their top priorities, detaching themselves from any expression of extremism, including of their owners and allies. Only then will extremist and intolerant groups face strong resistance and be challenged. We cannot afford to stay silent. As American Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel put it, “silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.” ______________________________________ The writer is a communication consultant with Fleishman Hillard Indonesia.  The views expressed are his own.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/09/07/religious-supremacy-and-our-silence.html,,2017
"Tue, October 17 2017",House invites hard-liners to discuss controversial Perppu,"The House of Representatives is set to invite 22 mass organizations to upcoming hearings on the regulation in lieu of law (Perppu) on mass organizations, which has been criticized for granting the government the power to disband organizations without a court order. Two of the organizations expected to attend hearings with the House’s Commission II, which oversees home affairs, are the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and the National Movement to Safeguard the Indonesian Ulema Council’s Fatwa (GNPF-MUI). The commission will send invitation letters to FPI chairman Ahmad Shabri Lubis and GNPF-MUI leader Bachtiar Nasir. “We will invite [organization] leaders representing all six [officially recognized] religions,” Commission II chairman Zainudin Amali of the Golkar Party said on Monday. The FPI and the GNPF-MUI are among Muslim organizations that have strongly protested the Perppu, which they claim could violate the freedom of association and expression. The Perppu has also been challenged through a judicial review at the Constitutional Court. Others religious groups to be invited are Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the country’s largest Muslim organization, and the second-largest, Muhammadiyah, as well as the Council of Buddhist Communities (Walubi) and the Indonesian Communion of Churches (PGI). The House kicked off hearings on the Perppu two weeks ago. Issued by President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo in July, the regulation has faced objections from rights activists, as it authorizes the Law and Human Rights Ministry to ban organizations without judicial process. Many believe the Perppu is the government’s tool to quickly disband hard-line group Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), which aspires to establish an Indonesian caliphate, which contravenes the state ideology of Pancasila. HTI is the first and so far only mass organization to have felt the impact of the Perppu. While issuing a Perppu is a presidential prerogative, later approval by the House is required. The ongoing hearings at Commission II should result in a proposal to be put to a House plenary vote for approval or rejection. Amali said the commission would also invite former HTI spokesman Ismail Yusanto as an individual, “because the HTI no longer exists.” The House will also hear views from National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian as well as Indonesian Military (TNI) commander Gen. Gatot Nurmantyo. Lawmakers from the Gerindra Party, the Muslim-based Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) and the National Mandate Party (PAN) strongly criticized the Perppu when it was issued. “The Perppu can lead to repressive action,” PAN faction secretary Yandri Susanto said. But the PKS and PAN have recently softened their stance on the matter, leaving Gerindra to fight a lonely battle to push for the House to reject the Perppu. Home Minister Tjahjo Kumolo said the freedom of association was still guaranteed but people should adhere to certain restrictions so as not to violate the rights of others. “The government appreciates all input and views, but the Perppu is really needed. [Several] organizations have shown blatant rejection of Pancasila,” the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) politician said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/10/17/house-invites-hard-liners-discuss-controversial-perppu.html,,2017
"Wed, October 25 2017",Commentary: Can Jokowi stem the tide of Islamic populism?,"There is no escaping the wave of Islamic populism that is now sweeping the country and is set to play a key role in the upcoming legislative and presidential elections. The old-fashioned political Islam that places the idea of establishing a sharia state as its core ideology and main selling point is over. For many Muslim voters today — like the angry white voters of Donald Trump in the United States or the staunch supporters of Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey — what matters the most is greater access to political and economic resources, not a formalization of “the divine laws.” The sociopolitical implications of the rise of Islamic populism are huge, though its symptoms had been largely ignored until last year when hundreds of thousands of Muslims took to the streets of Jakarta to call for the prosecution of then-Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian of Chinese descent, for blaspheming Islam. Political scientist Vedi Hadiz, who studied Islamic populism in Egypt, Turkey and Indonesia, defines Islamic populism as a cross-class alliance involving the budding but repressed middle classes among Muslim societies, the swelling number of urban poor and small sections of powerful bourgeoisie who want to grab electoral victories. Islamic populism has helped the Justice Development Party (AKP) win Turkey elections since 2002, allowing the party to maintain a strong grip on the country under Erdogan’s leadership. Hadiz insists, however, Indonesian Muslims failed to create a powerful bourgeoisie comparable to its Anatolian counterpart that has the capacity to build an alliance with the grass roots and mobilize them during elections. The current proponents of Islamic populism in Indonesia — such as the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) — also have no strong grassroots presence. Hadiz said Islamic populism had no future in Indonesia as it lacked the prerequisites that may allow them to emulate AKP’s success in Turkey. However, that does not necessarily mean that Islamic populism will not play a major role in Indonesian politics, particularly after the major anti-Ahok rallies that managed to bring together Muslims from different classes and even competing strands of Islamic activism, including some elements of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah, to achieve a common political goal. There is no reason to be overly anxious that Indonesia will turn into an Islamic state anytime soon. But there is a legitimate concern that, given the success of the anti-Ahok rallies during the Jakarta election earlier this year, the political elites are more than ready to ride the populist Islam wave for short-term political gains ahead of the 2019 legislative and presidential elections. The problem is that some of preconditions for a populist Islam revival are already there. Soeharto’s developmentalism, mainly driven by foreign investments, has produced new middle-class people who are pious and well educated but apparently still deprived of access to resources controlled by the elites linked in one way or another to the New Order. It has also produced large numbers of urban poor in the nation’s major cities who have often channeled their frustrations through religious or ethnic-based organizations like the FPI or the Betawi Brotherhood Forum (FBR). It is a fact that Indonesia has an inequality problem and President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, despite his populist image, has yet to show satisfying results in addressing the issue after three years in office. His opponents will capitalize on this by latching the issue of inequality onto issues of race and religion. It should come as no surprise that Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan, a potential challenger of Jokowi, invoked the word pribumi (indigenous Indonesians) in his inauguration speech. His speech fits the narrative of an Islamic community or ummah that is downtrodden, the main rationale behind the rise of Islamic populism. The political elites opposed to Jokowi, who have the backing of the bourgeoisie, including a part of the Chinese business community, may thus complete the prerequisites of a populist Islam revival — no matter how superficial it is — by providing the resources needed to mobilize angry Muslim voters. Islamic populism in Indonesia may then be based on a fragile alliance of social groups and classes with conflicting ideologies and interests, but it still can wield a potent power to change the nation’s political trajectory. It could overcome the ideological divide that hindered the Islamists from winning elections in the past. Inequality framed as an identity issue could likely invoke non-ideological voters who have no interest in creating a sharia state to vote for pro-sharia groups simply because they listen to their grievances and promises to bring changes. Jokowi should note that the grievances of the Muslim middle class and grass roots are not unjustified; he must work hard to address these problems or risk losing their support to his rivals who do not hesitate to create divisions to gain votes. He has to do more than just portray himself as a “pluralist” and “moderate Muslim leader” and portray his enemies as “intolerants,” “radicals” and “against Pancasila” to win votes, as many Muslim voters today may no longer be interested in ideological pigeonholing. The fact that urban, well-off and educated Muslims shared the stage with the FPI during the anti-Ahok rallies showed that Muslims traditionally portrayed as moderates care little about labels, which they believe are politically charged. As long as the problems of poverty and inequality are not fully addressed, or Jokowi fails to show that he truly cares about the issues, identity politics will thrive and he will suffer from it.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/10/25/commentary-can-jokowi-stem-tide-islamic-populism.html,,2017
"Wed, November 1 2017",Continuity and change in Jakarta — or will Anies pull a Trump?,"Do you have a friend who always disagrees and contradicts everything you say? I’m sure we’ve all had the experience of knowing someone like that. But if this friend gets too annoying, you just unfriend them, right? On Facebook, it just takes one click. Poof, they’re gone! Unfortunately, if it’s the President of the United States who exhibits this kind of behavior, you can’t “poof” him away with the click of a mouse. Yup, Donald Trump’s presidency is notoriously characterized for being contrarian, like the man himself. Policywise, he seems hell bent on obliterating everything his predecessor, Barack Obama, did. His most aggressive act is to kill Obamacare, the nickname for the Affordable Care Act. The citizens of Jakarta are now experiencing a similar situation, with a new governor, Anies Baswedan, and vice governor, Sandiaga Uno, who were officially inaugurated by President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo on Oct. 16. How are they similar? I’ll explain. But first, a bit of background. I knew Anies when he was rector of Paramadina University (2007-2014). He came across as a bright, moderate young Muslim intellectual, who believed in inclusivity, pluralism and an Islam that is rahmatan lil alamin, meaning, a faith that brings blessings and wellbeing to the entire inhabitants of the universe. In short, the embodiment of the compatibility of Islam and democracy. But during the elections, social media and the press were full of expressions of deep disappointment at Anies’s metamorphosis. He became the personification of divisiveness, sectarianism, cynicism, criticizing and insinuating with body language and facial expressions that were close to devilish. It was horrifying to watch. Shockingly, he embraced the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), an extremist group that ultimately wants a caliphate. Before running for vice governor of Jakarta, Sandiaga “Sandi” Uno was mainly known as a successful businessman until 2010, when he joined the Gerindra Party founded by Prabowo Subianto, who lost the presidential election in 2014. Sandi was a protégé of William Soeryadjaya, founder of Astra Group, one of the biggest automotive companies in Indonesia. Ironically, Sandi was reported to the police for alleged fraud by Edward Soeryadjaya, William’s son. Sandi won the case at the Supreme Court (MA) in 2010, but it was brought up again recently around the time of the gubernatorial elections. There is speculation that it could be revenge for the decision of the Anies-Sandi duo to halt the Jakarta Bay land reclamation project and the closure of the Alexis hotel over alleged prostitution (see “Anies shuts Alexis for rumored prostitution,” The Jakarta Post , Oct. 31). Okay, whatever their past, however they ran their campaign, whether they won the gubernatorial elections by hook or by crook, Anies and Sandi are now officially the leaders of Jakarta. We have to accept that, however bad the taste you want to spit out of your mouth. As Trump became the president for all Americans (you could’ve fooled me!), Anies and Sandi are now the governor and vice governor. They are now obliged to to heal post election divisions and act in the interests of all Jakartans. But boy, do they have a hard act to follow after Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, who transformed Jakarta in such a short time as if he had a magic wand, one that was made up of vision, firm leadership, the ability to take tough, unpopular decisions, determination, hard work, good management and coordination and proper and timely implementation, and most of all, a sincere heart. Ahok and his deputy, Djarot Syaiful Hidayat, who took over as governor of Jakarta after Ahok was imprisoned for blasphemy, raised the bar so high for any successor (see “‘Islami’, Islamist, Islam: Ahok, FPI and the rest of us Muslims,” The Jakarta Post , June, 29). Not long after their inauguration, Anies and Sandi met up with Jokowi at the State Palace. There were six items on Jokowi’s “menu” for the new Jakarta leaders: getting Jakarta ready for the Asian Games in 2018, the continuation of the MRT, the continuation of the light rail transit, sidewalks and streets in Jakarta, flood prevention in Jakarta as well as managing and tidying up shanty towns in the capital. Jokowi didn’t mention the horrendous Jakarta traffic? Hello! Anies and Sandi had also made a list of campaign promises, e.g.: providing Rp 1 billion (US$73,730) in funds for each community unit (RW), no evictions, zero down payments on house purchases, and many others. We need to give Anies and Sandi time to fulfill their promises, but the one they have been firm on is to halt the land reclamation project (see “Pros and cons of Jakarta reclamation,” RRI World Service, April 18, 2016, and “Jakarta bay reclamation project has potential to widen social gap,” Antara News, May 12, 2016). Not surprisingly, because it’s the most contentious and politically charged. Tony Rosyid, writing in the daily Republika (Oct. 29) says it’s the fighting arena between the people versus conglomerates. In truth, in the development not just of Jakarta, but of Indonesia as a whole, capital usually wins. Ahok was hated by conservative Muslims for being Christian, but he was also hated by capitalists and developers because he was very firm on corruption and on sticking to rules that benefitted the people and the public space they are entitled to. So, I was surprised to see how adamant Ahok was in defending the reclamation project. In this case, I tend to agree with historian JJ Rizal, who is of the view that the project is bad in terms of the environment, human rights and cultural preservation. Are Anies and Sandi halting the reclamation project because they truly believe it’s in the best interest of the people, or because it’s identified with Ahok? It goes back to their motivation for running for the governor and vice governorship in the first place. Is it merely a quest for power? In addition for Anies, is it a kind of “revenge” for being thrown out of Jokowi’s Cabinet when he was Minister of Education and Culture (allegedly for his lackluster performance)? As for Sandiaga, like Trump, he feels he’s “proven” himself to be a successful businessman, now it’s time to move into the political realm, ultimately even to aim for the top dog position? The Jakarta governorship is now seen as a stepping stone to the presidency after all. Politics is the art of compromise. Time will tell if Anies and Sandi can balance continuity and change, their quest for power, the interests of capital, and their obligation to truly serve Jakartans. Let’s hope that at least Anies doesn’t pull a Trump and can maintain the incredible progress his predecessor made! _________________________ The writer is the author of Julia’s Jihad.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/11/01/continuity-and-change-jakarta-or-will-anies-pull-a-trump.html,,2017
"Sat, December 2 2017",Clerics question motivation behind 212 reunion rally,"Kartono, 37, drove his pick-up truck all the way from Cirebon, West Java, on Thursday night, carrying 10 passengers with him as they planned to attend the 212 reunion rally on Saturday in Jakarta. One difference he observed was the level of enthusiasm, as on the exact same date last year, he traveled to the capital with hundreds of demonstrators. “We traveled here with seven buses last year. However, many of us couldn’t attend tomorrow’s event because there is similar celebration to commemorate Prophet Muhammad’s birthday in our town,” he told The Jakarta Post on Thursday. Touted as the 212 reunion, a reference to the date that the rally took place, the event is to celebrate last year’s mass rally that demanded the resignation of then-governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, who was seeking reelection. A series of rallies carried out by conservative Muslim groups, led by the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), preceded Jakarta’s gubernatorial election that saw Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent, lose the divisive election. Ahok was subsequently jailed for blasphemy for a comment he made regarding how certain politicians had used a Quranic verse for political means. Newly elected Governor Anies Baswedan has reportedly permitted the event to take place. However, he remained tight-lipped when asked whether he would attend the gathering. Unlike last year’s rally, which saw over 400,000 protesters on the streets, the rally planned on Saturday appears to have less appeal, with only a small crowd of people reportedly spotted at the Istiqlal Mosque and National Monument (Monas), both in Central Jakarta, where the event will take place. “Maybe many more people from outside Jakarta will come later tonight. They could still be on their way,” said 20-year-old Aditya Muhammad Haikal at the Istiqlal Mosque. He traveled from Cibinong, Bogor in West Java with a friend using a commuter train. A stage has been erected at Monas along with several banners promoting the event. Hundreds of people were visiting Monas on Thursday, but most were visitors. Jakarta Police spokesperson Sr. Comr. Argo Yuwono said his force was preparing to deploy tens of thousands of personnel to safeguard the rally. The Jakarta Police traffic unit planned to divert traffic in anticipation of heavy congestion by rerouting vehicles traveling toward Jl. Merdeka Barat and Jl. Merdeka Utara. FPI spokesperson Slamet Ma’arif said he expected hundreds of thousands of sympathizers would join the event, which would begin at dusk at the Istiqlal Mosque, where they would hold a mass Shubuh (dusk) prayer and then continue to Monas to listen to speeches by religious and political figures. “Legislative Assembly chairman Zulkifli Hasan, House of Representative deputy speakers Fahri Hamzah and Fadli Zon are among notable figures scheduled to attend,” Slamet said, denying allegations that the rally was politically motivated. Fadli and Fahri were among critics of the government and Jakarta administration under Ahok’s leadership. A number of democracy activists and religious leaders have criticized the rally, saying that members of the public should instead focus on more crucial issues such as disasters that have recently plagued the country. “We can do better by channeling our energy to help those in need because there have been many disasters recently,” Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) executive Imam Aziz said. Similarly, Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) deputy chairman Zainut Tauhid said sending Ahok to jail was not a reason to celebrate. “Is it really a fight that needs to be annually celebrated that we even have to establish an alumni forum? Our motivation should be to improve the wellbeing of our Muslim brothers and sisters and improve their level of education,” he said. Hendri Satrio, a political expert from Paramadina University, said the rally was politically driven and aimed at sending a message to sympathizers that they still existed.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/12/02/clerics-question-motivation-behind-212-reunion-rally.html,,2017
"Fri, December 15 2017",LBH Jakarta gets surge of SARA-based reports in 2017,"The year of 2017 has seen an increasing use of political identity leading to rising reports of discrimination, hate speech and persecution of minority groups in the name of tribal affiliations, religion, race and societal groups (SARA) in Jakarta, a year-end evaluation report of the Jakarta Legal Aid Institute (LBH Jakarta) has revealed. Throughout 2017, LBH Jakarta received 149 reports regarding discrimination, persecution and hate speech experienced by minority groups, a large increase compared to the 25 cases reported in 2016. A total of 999 justice seekers asked for the LBH’s assistance in their fight for freedom of religion, speech and expression. Director of LBH Jakarta Alghiffari Aqsa said the trend of discrimination, persecution and hate speech toward minority groups in Jakarta was a result of the use of political identity, especially during the Jakarta gubernatorial election this year. Starting from the use of racial issues against former Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, who is a Chinese-Indonesian Christian, Ahok was sentenced to two years in prison over charges of blasphemy against Islam, a case which was heavily politicized. “In politics of identity, differences in race, ethnicity and religion can be used by a group to confront and attack other groups to achieve their political agenda and to win the political contestation. It worries us, since we have been assisting many people from minorities and vulnerable groups that are looking for justice,” Alghiffari said on Tuesday. LBH Jakarta pointed out mass movements, such as the 411 and 212 rallies in Jakarta in 2016 and the first anniversary of the 212 rally this year as proof of the rise of political identity. “We received many reports of discrimination and hate speech on social media,” said Yunita, head of LBH Jakarta’s advocation division. To name a few, LBH Jakarta was assisting a Chinese woman who received a rape threat from a young man, because she supported Ahok in the Jakarta gubernatorial election. LBH Jakarta also gave legal aid to a 15-year-old boy, identified as PMA, resident of Cipinang Muara subdistrict in East Jakarta, who had been harassed and intimidated by individuals allegedly members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) over a social media post last July that allegedly insulted FPI leader Rizieq Shihab, who is on the police’s wanted list for allegedly violating the Pornography Law. The harassment was captured on video, which went viral on social media. “We also received reports of persecution with accusations of blasphemy. Now the trend is that when people criticize certain figures or a particular group, they can be persecuted or criminalized on the grounds of the SARA sentiment,” added Yunita. In view of the increasing discrimination and persecution in the name of SARA, LBH Jakarta warned people of possible usage of the same sentiment in the 2019 general election. “In the upcoming political years ahead, we are worried that politics of identity will be used again by political actors to get power and win the elections. Issues regarding ethnicity and religious sentiments will continue to emerge,” said Alghiffari. Overall, LBH Jakarta revealed that they had received 1,224 complaints from 19,039 justice seekers this year, a slight decrease from last year’s 1,444 reports. LBH Jakarta also received many complaints about labor issues, such as salary disputes, with 223 reports filed and 4,565 justice seekers. Of that number, South Jakarta recorded 41 cases from 170 justice seekers, while East Jakarta booked 39 cases with 3,185 justice seekers. On city and urban society issues, which include forced eviction, LBH Jakarta received 154 reports, 20 cases more than last year, with a total of 6,807 justice seekers.

"Thu, December 21 2017",Commentary: Xmas is ‘just’ an ordinary birthday celebration,"It was Friday evening in Bethlehem in October several years ago. I took my wife to the rooftop at the home of a Palestinian Muslim family, who had invited us for dinner. We heard the azan (a call to prayer for Muslims) from a nearby mosque. She stood at her wheelchair and we sang Holy Night while looking at the Church of the Nativity where Jesus was believed to be born. I don’t know why, but I felt more peaceful and more religious in Bethlehem than in Jerusalem, a holy site for Judaism, Christianity and Islam. “We shall return,” we said in our prayer. Our Palestinian host said Muslims are obliged to highly respect Jesus, a prophet in Islam. I told him that celebrating Christmas is more peaceful in Bethlehem than in Jakarta. Terrorist attacks have haunted churchgoers on Christmas Eve for nearly two decades. “That is nothing compared to our suffering from the Jews here,” the old man said. During our pilgrimage to Israel, and also Palestinian territory, we could easily see the Israelis’ unbelievable oppression of the Palestinians. In Jerusalem it is easy to understand when people say World War III could start there. The Palestinians’ living situation is very inhumane. But they always smile at visitors despite the daily horrors they have to confront. But for me, Jakarta is more worrying during the festive days, especially because I worry about the safety of my wife, who was powerless when bombs exploded in our own church in East Jakarta in 2000 and again in July 2001. How about next Monday? I feel more secure now. But it is not because my faith is more mature or that I have completely surrendered my life to Jesus. The recent statement issued by an organization that is often feared by minorities like me, was a little bit heartening, no matter whether it is true or false. The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) said it would help safeguard Christmas celebrations at the National Monument (Monas). It was also very active in the recent demonstration to condemn United States President Donald Trump’s decision to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) has also recently softened its stance on expressing Christmas greetings. It had previously said it was not haram to say “Merry Christmas” to Christians. But now the ulemas apparently consider that the greeting is just a matter of courtesy. When I greet my Muslim friends during Idul Fitri, it does not mean that I become a Muslim too. The police have also not issued any warnings this year as they have done in previous years. But to be honest, it is hard to sense a merry atmosphere in Jakarta. Many shopping malls are refraining from openly presenting a Christmas atmosphere; some radio and TV stations are also not airing Christmas carols. Their position is very understandable, they do not want to create unnecessary problems for their business. Many, if not most, Indonesian Christian Protestants and Catholics laughed bitterly and were shocked when they heard last week that the FPI had stated it would support Christmas celebrations in the name of religious tolerance. Has a miracle happened or has Santa Claus come to town? For an ordinary Indonesian with little knowledge of theology or religion such as myself, every year the birthday of Jesus becomes a huge hullabaloo of security, political or social concerns, including terrorist threats, although it is actually just an ordinary birthday celebration. However the FPI’s endorsement of Christmas likely applies only once and in one place. Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan has allowed Christians to celebrate Christmas at Monas after he recently permitted Muslims to hold huge gatherings there. Some Christians may say it is simply exaggeration. The FPI is always hostile toward any Christmas-related events or moments. Just Google it. “Islam is rahmatan lil’alamin [a blessing for the universe] and is very supportive of pluralism, differences must be respected,” tirto.co news portal quoted FPI Jakarta branch secretary-general, Novel Chaidir Hasan Bamukmin, as saying. The two largest Muslim organizations in Indonesia, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah have regularly assured security during Christmas. But I have never heard such assurances from the FPI before. But who knows? Maybe we are totally wrong this time. The Indonesian Communion of Churches (PGI) has strongly rejected the offer to hold Christmas celebrations at Monas, while the Indonesian Bishops Conference (KWI) has taken the same position, albeit in a more subtle tone. Basically, they suspected the offer was made just for political purposes. Anies has dropped the plan and offered a more acceptable location. The PGI and the KWI have voiced the feeling of their followers. On social media, there are suspicions that Governor Anies and the FPI are suddenly being friendly toward them just to accommodate Christian relatives or friends of Gerindra Party leader Prabowo Subianto. But the reactions are sometimes too much and go against the teaching of Christianity itself. “I just want to slap the faces of those who want to go there [Monas],” posted one social media user, while on the same page condemning the intolerance from the Muslim side. For me, whatever the motivation of the governor and the FPI, their statement is certainly interesting. Technically, Christmas is just an ordinary birthday celebration. Why should we make a big fuss of it? That is probably the reason why the FPI softened its position. Churchgoers will hopefully experience a beautiful day on Monday.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/12/21/commentary-xmas-just-ordinary-birthday-celebration.html,,2017

There is no single definition of religion that can be accepted by all. Thus, let the adherents of indigenous faiths live according to what they believe. Ridwan AN Yogyakarta I think Home Minister Tjahjo Kumolo'Äôs idea to allow persons to leave the religion column blank on their ID cards is inspired by passports, where there isn'Äôt a religion column and which runs well internationally. But when this is applied to the Indonesian ID card, it creates serious problems. It becomes a very sensitive issue because it touches on race religion and ethnicity; it will create serious conflict in Indonesia. The way out is that the government should admit and officially endorse any indigenous faith embraced by Indonesians and call on local government officials to give equal treatment to the adherents of minority religions, including indigenous faiths, in any official administrative procedures.

"Sat, November 15, 2014",Editorial: Ahok the Bold,"Acting Jakarta governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama has proven himself to be a fearless figure when it comes to defending his principles. He recently filed a recommendation with the home and law and human rights ministers to disband the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) on the grounds that the group had acted in violation of the Constitution in its opposition to his appointment as governor because of his ethnicity and religion. Ahok is widely known for his guts. He broadcast on YouTube a video of his meeting with officials of the city'Äôs Public Works Agency in which he demanded budget efficiency. He openly criticized Gerindra and later quit the party in protest against its support for the law that ended direct elections for regional leaders. The FPI has relentlessly protested Ahok'Äôs promotion to the governorship; one rally last month ended in violence, leaving a number of police officers wounded. 'ÄúThey are an embarrassment to their own religion. The organization does not deserve to exist. I have written a letter recommending the FPI be banned, and will send it to the [minister] tomorrow, because the group'Äôs actions violate the Constitution,'Äù Ahok said on Monday. Ahok is right. No one can stop the process of his inauguration as governor; under the existing law, he is the only figure who holds the right to fill the post left vacant by Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo, who is now President. That'Äôs why the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), unlike the FPI, has called on Jakartans to accept Ahok as their legitimate leader. It is regrettable that the FPI receives backing from local elites, namely city councilors from the Red-and-White Coalition 'Äî Gerindra, the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), the United Development Party (PPP), the Democratic Party and the National Mandate Party (PAN). The councilors opted to boycott the City Council'Äôs plenary session on Friday held to approve Ahok'Äôs governorship. Despite their opposition, however, Ahok'Äôs inauguration looks imminent. After the approval by the City Council, President Jokowi, who will return from his trip overseas on Monday, is set to swear in Ahok as the governor soon, although the Home Ministry has not set a date for Ahok'Äôs induction. When Ahok assumes power, uncertainty over the city'Äôs leadership will end and the municipal administration will be able to immediately focus on the tasks at hand. As acting governor, Ahok has no authority to approve government projects or allocate the budget for 2015. The prolonged political squabbling will only jeopardize efforts to address lingering problems facing the capital, including annual flooding, which may strike soon now that the rainy season has come. Certainly, Jakarta'Äôs people will fall victims to the political brouhaha. The elites have become embroiled in a power play, which has nothing to do with their voters'Äô interests. It is the right of any Jakarta citizen to disagree with Ahok'Äôs inauguration as governor. But they cannot ignore, and have to accept, like it or not, the law which justifies his ascent to Jakarta'Äôs top executive post.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/11/15/editorial-ahok-bold.html,,2014

Makamba Tecumseh The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) is a confusing group. They say they are the defenders of Islam. Is that true? When Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama was nominated vice governor, did they protest? If the answer is no, it means that they accepted Ahok as the vice governor. If they accepted Ahok as the vice governor, they should have known that if the governor passed away or resigned, the vice governor would automatically replace the non-active governor. But now suddenly they seem to have regretted choosing Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo and Ahok. Why? Are they really defending Islam? I can'Äôt see the point. If FPI cannot accept a non-Muslim governor, they must also stage protests for the existence of other non-Muslim governors, ministers, etc. One characteristic of true Muslims is that wherever they are, they always bring peace. Does the FPI always bring peace? Indonesia is not a Muslim country, so why does the FPI behave as if this country was an Islamic country? Needless to say, the followers are the representation of the leader. Who is the leader? Habib Rizieq. What'Äôs wrong with Habib Rizieq? He is known for his inconsistency. He hates Wahabi, but at the same time he has made the FPI like Wahabi. Ali Mukhtar We do need people like Ahok who are not scared of terror and death. I hope he'Äôll be the first of many leaders who show integrity and who are not afraid to challenge the bad people, even though he'Äôs pretty much alone. I'Äôve been monitoring the Indonesian media for the last three years and, as a foreigner, let me say that I can see an inevitable change is happening; it'Äôs going slowly, but I can already see that people are now much more informed, politically educated and I can even see more Muslims accepting and showing support for Ahok openly, something that was quite impossible even 10 years ago [...] A Christian of Chinese-descent is governing the capital city. It is a great era for Indonesia. I'Äôm optimistic. If only the Indonesian law is strong enough and brave enough to take down the rich corrupt baddies, the revolution will happen even more quickly. Let me tell you that many foreigners take an interest in Indonesia, more so since the Jokowi era, we can already see that Indonesia soon will be able to beat Singapore and Malaysia economically and politically.

I'Äôm an American-born Indonesian living in Jakarta at the moment. I moved to Indonesia to learn my roots. I wanted to also put my college degree into use and help with what I can to improve the welfare of the people here. I am a moderate Muslim but am far from being a Muslim-in-name-only. My opinions on Islam were shaped by my environment and largely by my grandfather who was a kyai (Ulema) and professor of Islamic philosophy. I don'Äôt claim my opinions to be correct, but they are what I myself believe to be true. So far I'Äôve lived here in Jakarta for seven months and it is my first time living anywhere outside of the US. I'Äôve followed the news since I got here to understand the political socio-economic climate of Jakarta. Though Ahok'Äôs tactics may be no more hardline than the FPI'Äôs, this is the type of leader Jakarta needs to shake up the city. Religion and ethnic affiliation are not important. What is important is his undying passion and commitment to improving Jakarta'Äôs situation. Other than President Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo, who has made an honest effort? His background is not important so as long it doesn'Äôt affect his duties. My question is what has Ahok done wrong that is a threat to Islam in Jakarta? Did he burn our holy book? Did he create unfair laws for Muslims to practice our religion? Did he wrongfully imprison a group of Muslims for the crime of practicing Islam? I do disagree with Ahok on whether the FPI should be disbanded. Although, I don'Äôt agree with their cause, I still believe freedom of speech should be upheld. In the US, the ACLU (a non-profit organization that advocates for civil liberties) supported a neo-Nazi group holding a rally in a city in the US despite disagreeing with their message. I believe that every group has that liberty so as long there aren'Äôt any threats being made. You all may disagree with me but I want to share my opinion and my experience. I know what it'Äôs like to be marginalized being a Muslim in the US. But that doesn'Äôt mean I need to seek revenge upon others that have done wrong to me. So if the FPI is looking to avenge a vendetta in the name of Allah I am disappointed in them. After all, Islam did not teach us to commit violent acts and seek retribution especially not in Allah'Äôs name. Though the Prophet Muhammad SAW did go into war to take back Mecca that is a concession Allah made for him.

I will back you up in becoming governor and silencing those extremists and their false words. Only the people have the power to make a change now. In Sanctus I think we should consider the political reasons why the FPI hasn'Äôt been disbanded when clearly it is breaking the law and terrorizing people. Abu Dagu Banning organizations is not always an effective way of controlling them. The real issue here is the law. If members of an organization break the law, then the full force of the law should be used against them. It may, however, be possible that the law itself, or the enforcement of the law, is weak. There has to be in the first place the political will, full control over policing by the government and finally severe penalties for individuals who break laws aimed at social harmony. There always has to be a balance between democracy and social harmony. Democracy means free speech to advocate for laws and even changes to the constitution. Social harmony means prevention of harm to all groups in a society. Jagera I have long hoped that the FPI be disbanded, so I strongly support Ahok'Äôs wish. The FPI has proven itself very destructive, far from representing the values of Islam. Furthermore this organization has been in the background of some anarchist activities. There should be no place in Indonesia for such a group as this nation highly values religious tolerance. Hatanto Reksodipoetro Jakarta At last somebody has come to his senses wanting to have the FPI banned. Do we stupidly have to wait until a counter Catholic Defenders Front is created?

"Thu, November 20, 2014",Your letters: Banning FPI may not be a good idea,"The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) has been in the headlines frequently of late and for all the wrong reasons. The headlines always feature the same few words: protest, radical, extreme, violent and, of course, Islam. So it was to no one'Äôs surprise when the ever-controversial acting Jakarta governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama proposed disbanding the FPI. Not unprecedented. The move is not only appreciated by the majority of the citizens sick and tired of the FPI'Äôs antics; the National Police also seems keen to respond to the acting governor'Äôs challenge. However, the ultimate question would be: will disbanding or banning the organization mean the end of the FPI? Or will it mean the end of democracy? More importantly, will it be a solution, or will it ignite new problems? A view popular among the people is that that the banning of the FPI will mean an end to the violence that the FPI has been conducting over the years. This opinion is heard often on social media, the argument being that not only the FPI but also other organizations may then be reluctant to use force to express their opinion. The National Police would also favor this move, as it would be a chance to show 'Äúwho'Äôs the man'Äù. On the other hand, organizations, and the FPI especially, are driven by a belief, by an idea, by a principle. Disbanding the organization does not mean that every member will then willingly or unwillingly shake off their ideology. It would mean that they would perform secretly. It would mean that they would believe they had no obligation to obey the law, as they would not exist according to the law itself. Let alone difficult to track, FPI members would be difficult to find. They would be hidden, yet we would all know of their existence. An underground organization that came into prominence for its violence is by no means a sign of good things to come. Not to mention that the act of banning would not be viewed positively by the members and the supporters of the FPI and could lead to further protests and chaos. The ideal solution may be to impose punishments and restrictions. Imprisoning violent and provocative members is a tempting step, but not the most effective. A better approach may be to strip members of the FPI of some of their rights. A simple example would be restricting or limiting their orations, especially after their anarchic protests. The FPI also needs to be monitored tightly and be given some kind of probation. I do want to take sides in this matter, but I would like to offer readers a different perspective, rather than reaching for the easiest solution and overlooking what may happen in the aftermath of a ban.

"Fri, November 21, 2014",Chinese-Indonesians: Time to end the fear and blaming,"As a starry-eyed student in the early 2000s, I looked forward to a post-racial, post-religious Indonesia formed by the reformasi. Any 'Äúrealist'Äù would laugh, but would anyone have believed back then that in 2014 Indonesia would have a non-tycoon businessman as president, a self-made woman as a minister and, stranger than fiction, a Chinese Christian as Jakarta governor? Back in 2002, the Jakarta Catholic Youth published several scenarios on Indonesia for 2012, from the most optimistic to the worst outlook. In 2012, we were still worried about the dangers of religious radicalism and military authoritarianism. Now, it seems both monsters have been kept at bay and at least one has lost its momentum. The most ideal scenario described how a young Chinese couple helped improve a fishing village outside Jakarta. A Chinese couple was depicted because most Indonesian Christians have a Chinese background, like in Malaysia and Singapore, and because of the traumatic May 1998 riots, which happened four years before the release of the paper. The riots had led many Chinese-Indonesians to flee the country. An outcome of reformasi was the formal improvement of religious and social rights for Chinese-Indonesians. Chinese-Indonesians are still widely thought of as wealthy. Studies in the US show that Asian-Americans on average earn higher household incomes than other races, including white Americans. Meanwhile, the top of Forbes'Äô list of the richest Indonesians is dominated by ethnic Chinese industrialists. Individually, the truth is varied. As a group, it is perhaps above average. Yet Asian-Americans believe there is still discrimination against them in corporations, government, arts and the media. Many Americans still view them as outsiders, even as the history of Chinese-Americans is longer than the histories of, for instance, Italian- or Polish-Americans. It'Äôs the same story in Indonesia. The total number of Chinese-Indonesians is estimated to be around seven to 10 million. That makes them the world'Äôs largest overseas Chinese group and one of the largest ethnic groups in Indonesia. Yet they seem invisible in the media, even as one encounters them every day in any city. The year 2014 has been a roller coaster one for Chinese-Indonesians, especially in Jakarta. There was big excitement over the election of then governor and later President Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo and deputy governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama. But rumors of impending riots never died in the community 'Äî ahead of the April legislative election and the July presidential election, ahead of the August verdict of the Constitutional Court regarding the results of the presidential elections and, most recently, on the eve of Ahok'Äôs inauguration as Jakarta governor. Chinese worldwide love order and stability and therefore dislike mass protests and fear riots. After all, more than half of the 10 deadliest conflicts in history took place in China. That is what makes the Hong Kong student movement surprising and controversial among overseas Chinese, including in Indonesia. That is what makes some Chinese-Indonesians still secretly blame the students for rising up against Soeharto 16 years ago. And so the weird pattern of blaming the bully'Äôs fighter, rather than the bully, emerges. It is easy for a Chinese-Indonesian to show support for President Jokowi, but he or she can be more reserved regarding Governor Ahok. Even more strangely, some feel uncomfortable with Ahok'Äôs larger-than-life personality and sharp tongue. These people believe that Ahok will only invite trouble for other Chinese-Indonesians 'Äî no matter how big their contempt for hardline Islamist groups. What is ironic is the enthusiasm of other Indonesians, including so many Muslims, for the prospect of Ahok taking care of Jakarta. The reality is that the non-Chinese are fine with him, are happy with him, while some Chinese Jakartans are biting their lips and, again, are worried about a possible backlash. Complaining about imperfection is a favorite Chinese sport, including complaining about how terrible Indonesia is. But now is not the time for that. Indonesia is lucky to have the best available men and women running the government and cities. At a time when the quality of national and local governments is deteriorating in Asia, we choose to move forward. When other Islamic democracies are flirting with conservatism, we'Äôve decided to improve our democracy. Fighting-man Ahok is a good role model for Chinese-Indonesians and that is not because he is outspoken or because he joined politics. It is because he is determined to repair and clean the capital'Äôs horrific clogs and messes. He is not afraid of crossing the bad guys 'Äî those people whose deeds drench us in acid rain, waste our time with traffic jams and torture us with terrible television programs. It is simply a miracle that Ahok is where he is now. He had made brave and very risky calls, from standing up against his former party to declaring war on the detested Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Indonesians have given him so much credit, so it is only right for Chinese-Indonesians to count Ahok as a brother. If politics and activism are too scary (and they are), then there are so many other possibilities. Many bloggers have offered tips on starting a personal 'Äúmental revolution'Äù. Put trash into bins. Follow the rules. Treat everyone with respect. Reject corruption. Be on time. Be patient. Many Chinese-Indonesians compare Indonesia unfavorably to Singapore and yet like other Indonesians, many of them break the rules. Why complain about how dirty Jakarta is if you don'Äôt carry your trash with you? Why complain about how corrupt Indonesians are if you are also addicted to the quick-and-easy fix? Fellow Chinese-Indonesians, you may be nationalistic or you might be cynical about Indonesia. I do not care as long you keep buildings clean and you treat store staff with respect. Ahok may not make Jakarta as clean and safe as Singapore any time soon, but it is much better to help him do his job than to fret about the FPI or complain about floods. He is working and so should you. The year 2014 has been a roller coaster one for Chinese-Indonesians, especially in Jakarta. ______________ The writer teaches English and Australian cultural studies at Uni-Bridge, St. Aloysius High School, Bandung.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/11/21/chinese-indonesians-time-end-fear-and-blaming.html,,2014
"Wed, December 3, 2014",Issue of the day: Yudhoyono gets religious on Twitter,"Nov. 29, p4 Former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono delivered a statement through the popular microblogging site Twitter on Friday warning his successor President Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo against becoming a 'Äútyrant'Äù. Yudhoyono said that Jokowi and other state leaders in the world should be careful about only wanting their orders to be implemented and their statements to be agreed with. 'ÄúA leader who always want his actions and words to be followed could unwittingly become a dictator or tyrant,'Äù Yudhoyono said in one of his Twitter feeds from his handle @SBYudhoyono. He also called on leaders to not abuse their authority, since ultimate power belonged to the almighty. 'ÄúHe could take away the power from anybody, anytime,'Äù Yudhoyono asserted. While he was the country'Äôs president, Yudhoyono'Äôs Twitter feed sat in third place with 5.06 million followers, after US President Barack Obama (@BarackObama) with 43.7 million and Pope Francis (@Pontifex) with 14.1 million. Currently, @SBYudhoyono is followed by 6.3 million subscribers. Your comments: I agree with Yudhoyono. Although he no longer serves as president, he has 10 years experience in leading this country, so he knows how to govern this country. He knows how to utilize his leadership and not to tyrannize, because all of the decisions have to be discussed with all the competent authorities. Mr. Jokowi should consider what Mr. SBY said. Poppy Sarii Had I been the subject of these comments, I would most certainly perceive and dismiss them as an attempt to patronize me and push the speaker back into the spotlight. Not least because they come from a man whose career has been notable for its mediocrity, with the (possible) exception of maintaining democracy (kind of), manipulating statistics (e.g. in regard to poverty reduction or religious tolerance) and making grand speeches and empty promises. Yudhoyono, let the numbers speak for themselves: The year of 2004 was your election as a first-time president, but having already served as minister for a while and with the support of the military (as the 'Äúthinking general'Äù) you received initially 39,838,184 votes (runoff 69,266,350 votes). Jokowi received (without a runoff) 70,997,859 votes to become President. The year of 2009 was your second turn as president and you received 73,874,562 votes (fewer than three million votes more than Jokowi in his first term as President). However, and this needs to be especially noted as it was just a short while ago 'Äî people did not look too kindly on your second term as president, since your party 'Äî of which you were the figurehead 'Äî received only 12,728,913 votes (in other words - 10.19 percent of all votes).

But those brave enough to speak, to try relentlessly to control outcomes, will always have the respect of the people.

"Fri, December 5, 2014",Issue of the day: FPI inaugurates own 'Äògovernor'Äô,"Dec. 1, Online Members of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) 'Äúinaugurated'Äù their choice for Jakarta governor, Fahrurozzi Ishaq, during their latest protest outside the Jakarta City Council (DPRD) building against the governorship of Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama. Fahrurozzi was 'Äúsworn in'Äù by the head of the Betawi Brotherhood Forum (FBR) and member of the Jakarta Saviors Presidium, Luthfi Hakim, who stated that Fahrurozzi, coordinator of the Jakarta Community Movement (GMJ), would begin his duties as Jakarta governor effective immediately. 'ÄúWith this, the entire presidium has decided that the governor of Jakarta is Fahrurrozi Ishaq,'Äù Luthfi announced during the 'Äúceremony'Äù in front of the council building on Monday as quoted by tempo.co. Your comments: These demonstrators are the Indonesian version of the Republican Party in America, who voted to repeal Obamacare 48 times just because they don'Äôt want the first black president to leave a legacy. Lasem Benny I'Äôm sorry that Pak Ahok does not agree with your narrow-minded religious bigotry. HB Mccoy I'Äôm pleased he doesn'Äôt agree with their narrow-minded religious bigotry. Peka Dede Is anyone taking these people seriously? It looks like they are just members of gangs, doing their best to prop up increasingly unpopular sections of the old elite. Deedee S What is the difference between this and Papua claiming to be its own state? They are basically forming their own government by doing this. How is this not treason? Jbl. Nor What? Isn'Äôt it the other way around, Ahok declares FPI illegal? Oh man, I can'Äôt stop laughing reading all these articles about the FPI and their self-proclaimed governor. What a way to start my day. Chotto Matter Alright Jakarta residents, you have to pay double local taxes now: one to Ahok'Äôs administration, the other to the FPI administration. They should read the law properly first before declaring Ahok illegal. The law says that the governor is inaugurated only by the president and in his/her absence, the vice president. I don'Äôt see either of those two inaugurating this Fahrurozzi. They should first inaugurate an FPI president of Indonesia, then he will inaugurate the governor. Good luck to your endeavors, FPI. Ponders I actually thought this was quite funny. Maybe they could build a cardboard 'Äúgovernor'Äôs office'Äù outside of City Hall 'Äî kind of like the Aboriginal embassy in Canberra, Australia. It could become a tourist attraction. You could bring your own nasi bungkus (packaged rice meal) and have your picture taken feeding them. Loro Blonyo Does this not ultimately constitute an attack on Indonesia and its government? Sorry but last time I checked, the FPI and their radical friends constituted a miniscule but extremely loud and violent part of Jakarta and Indonesia. They have openly opposed Indonesian laws and are traitors to Indonesia 'Äî correct me if I am wrong. Deddy K This is clearly blatant discrimination. Any group that promotes disharmony and disorder among SARA (tribal affiliations, religion, race and societal groups) must be considered 'Äúterrorists'Äù and banned. Democracy tolerates political dissent and ideological differences but not lawlessness. James Waworoendeng We'Äôve all had enough of these people. When will the police ship them out to Nusakambangan? Sudarshana Chakra The first thing people here need to do is to learn how to be tolerant of others and get a better work ethic, albeit  most wouldn'Äôt know what work was, even less any ethics that may be attached to it. Bay V Pak Jokowi, when will you say 'Äúenough is enough'Äù? Robby Kaware If it wasn'Äôt so prejudiced, infantile and absurd I may possibly have had a laugh at this latest piece of lunacy but, as it is, I am hardly able to raise the effort to roll my eyes anymore. I think that the first act of 'Äúour new governor'Äù should be ascertaining the collective IQ of the entire FPI membership. Nevertheless I do however really look forward to the elucidation of our new 'Äúgovernor'Äôs'Äù programs later today and I remain optimistically enthusiastic that these proposed programs may totally surprise us all by being eminently feasible, realistic, attainable, workable, budget practicable, cost effective and of general overall benefit to all sectors and sections of Jakarta society.

"Wed, February 6 2008",Pilots protest over arrest of Garuda pilot,"Members of the Federation of Indonesian Pilots (FPI) protest over the arrest of Garuda pilot Marwoto Komar during a rally at the House of Representatives in Jakarta on Tuesday. They also demanded that the police delay the detention of Marwoto in connection with the Garuda plane crash in Yogyakarta in March last year, in which 21 people were killed. Yogyakarta Police officially detained Marwoto on Monday night after interrogating him for more than 10 hours. He was accused of negligence causing death. FPI president Manotar Napitupulu told members of the House Commission V in charge of transportation that this was ""a criminalization of a pilot"" that could eventually affect flight safety. ""Such treatment could make pilots depressed about doing their jobs. Even operating a plane under normal circumstances has become a burden for pilots,"" he said. On a separate occasion Tuesday, the Association of National Airlines (Inaca) also urged the police not to detain Marwoto because it could have a serious psychological impact on other pilots. Inaca secretary general Tengku Burhanudin said that it was all right for the police to question him because the legal process must go on but they should not detain him. He said a pilot who had a psychological problem could affect flight safety in the short term, but in the long run it could affect the availability of pilots. ""Many pilots would quit for fear of prosecution in case of an accident."" Meanwhile, the president of the Association of Garuda Indonesia Pilots, Stephanus, said the opposition to the criminalization of pilots would get the backing of 100 countries grouped under the International Federation of Airline Pilot Associations.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/02/06/pilots-protest-over-arrest-garuda-pilot.html,,2008
"Wed, April 2 2008",Muslims told to show maturity,"Indonesians are being urged to show ""mature but critical"" responses to Fitna , as Muslims here continued to hold protest rallies Tuesday against the anti-Islamic film made by Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders. ""Avoid excessive reaction. It is not a film, but a tool of propaganda,"" noted film director Garin Nugroho said as quoted by Antara news agency. He said Muslims should instead emulate the actions of the Prophet Muhammad who was ""clever in telling stories and always taught only the good things"". ""Nowadays there are many such films as Fitna . So people should be cautious, more critical and mature in their reactions."" Muhammadiyah chairman Din Syamsuddin said the film could potentially strengthen ""tension or hatred between civilizations, specifically Islam and the West"". He said Wilders should be taken to International Court as a ""criminal against civilization"". ""It is normal for Muslims to protest but there is no need to be emotional because the dignity of Islam will never be diminished with an insult by any side,"" Din said in a text message to The Jakarta Post . Dozens of Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) supporters staged a rally Tuesday outside the Dutch Embassy in Jakarta to protest the release of Fitna . They carried posters calling for the punishment of Wilders. One showed an image of him bearing fangs and with a gun at either side of his head. Alongside the slogan was written ""Death to the insulter of Islam"". The Dutch government and other European countries have not banned blasphemy against Islam under the pretext of freedom of speech. ""This demonstrates they are applying a double standard policy,"" HTI spokesman Muhammad Ismail Yusanto said during the protest. He said certain European countries punished doubters and critics of the holocaust but let be those who insulted Islam. A similar protest was also held by hundreds of members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) at the same place on Monday. The hard-lined FPI condemned the Dutch government for allowing the release of the film to the public and asked the Indonesian government to recall its ambassador to the Netherlands in protest against the film. Late Monday, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono urged Indonesians to avoid violence in venting their anger about the film. He also barred Wilders from entering Indonesia and said screenings of the 17-minute Fitna would be banned in the former Dutch colony. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has called the film ""offensively anti-Islamic"". The film, released on the Internet last Thursday, features imagery of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and the 2004 Madrid bombings combined with quotes from the Koran. It intersperses speeches from Islamic extremists calling for attacks on non-Muslims. The film ends with an appeal for Muslims to rip out sections of the Koran it says promote violence.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/04/01/muslims-told-show-maturity.html,,2008
"Mon, June 2 2008",Hard-liners ambush Monas rally,"HARD-LINING: A man from the Islamic organization Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia welcomes members of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) during a rally at the National Monument (Monas) in Central Jakarta on Sunday. ( JP/P.J. Leo ) Members of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) attacked activists at the National Monument (Monas) in Central Jakarta on Sunday afternoon, leaving 34 injured. National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) activists had entered the Monas area to commemorate the 63rd year of Pancasila state ideology, when they were confronted and beaten by FPI members, Adj. Sr. Comr. Suharna of the Jakarta Police told The Jakarta Post. ""We had warned the alliance about a possible clash with Islamic groups who would be staging a protest against the fuel price increases at the same time, but they insisted on going anyway,"" he said. The AKKBB earlier announced the event to the public through newspapers, saying they endorsed pluralism and urged everybody not to be intimidated by people who threatened practitioners of different beliefs, as in the case of the Ahmadiyah Islamic sect. Thousands of Ahmadiyah followers in the country have lived under threat after the sect was declared blasphemous by several hard-line groups. ""We were warned by the police that the Hizbut Tahrir Islamic group would also be holding a protest here but we did not know that FPI members would be among them,"" AKKBB event coordinator Nong Darol said. She said that after being warned, the alliance decided to hold the event for only an hour at Monas and then march on to the Hotel Indonesian traffic circle. ""We were shocked when FPI members chased and beat us with bamboo sticks, mostly those who were already inside Monas. We ran away but they had already hurt many people,"" she said. When contacted, Nong was accompanying Mohammad Guntur Romli to surgery at Army Central Hospital in Central Jakarta. Guntur's cheek bone was fractured by blows from FPI members wielding sticks. FPI spokesman Munarman told radio reporters the incident was in reaction to the alliance's offensive statement in several newspapers last Tuesday. Abdurrohman Djailani of the FPI said the group would be available for a press conference at its headquarters in Petamburan, West Jakarta, on Monday. No one was arrested in the incident. Jakarta Police chief Sr. Comr. Budi Winarko told reporters he would arrest perpetrators beginning Monday. ""Arresting them at the scene would have worsened the situation as it could have triggered bigger riots. We have already gotten video tape evidence from reporters and will arrest them in the following days,"" he said. He said 1,200 police officers were at the scene when the clash occurred. The attack was quickly condemned by human rights activists, politicians and Muslim organizations Muhammadiyah and Nahdatul Ulama (NU). ""The NU opposes any violence for any reason. There is no religious justification that tolerates violent actions. I urge the government to immediately take proper measures against the perpetrators. If the state ignores this case, its authority will be destroyed and more anarchy will emerge,"" Masdar Farid Masudi of the NU said. Din Syamsudin, chairman of the country's second-largest Muslim organization Muhammadiyah, voiced similar concerns. ""This action is not in line with Islamic teachings and will tarnish Islam's image. It is a crime that must be prosecuted. I hope everyone can control him or herself and avoid violence and anarchism,"" he said. The Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence (Kontras) also condemned the attack, saying it urged President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to turn his attention to the incident and asking the police to arrest FPI members involved in the violence.

( JP/Nana Rukmana ) National Police detective chief Comr. Gen. Bambang Hendarso Dahuri briefs reporters in Jakarta on Monday on the investigation on the attacks of FPI members against supporters of the National Alliance for Religious and Faith Freedom (AKKBB). ( JP/P.J. Leo ) Police are pursuing five men wanted for their roles in Sunday's attack of National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) activists at the National Monument (Monas) in Central Jakarta. ""We are in the process of arresting the five suspects,"" Sr. Comr. Ketut Untung Yoga Ana said here Monday. He said the police, who had yet to arrest anyone as of Monday night, were also gathering evidence to determine who committed violent acts during the clash. Earlier on Monday, Islamic Troop Command (KLI) spokesman Munarman told reporters he was the leader of the attack and blamed the alliance for triggering the clash. ""They wanted it to happen because they spread their wrongful accusations against us in the newspapers,"" he told a press conference at the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) headquarters in Petamburan, West Jakarta. ""We are defending Islam and the government should ban Ahmadiyah. The clash in Monas is just an initial warning to whoever supports Ahmadiyah. I have prepared my people for a possible long-term war,"" said the former chairman of the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute Foundation (YLBHI). Munarman said the KLI consisted of multiple Islamic fronts in Indonesia, but declined to name which ones. At least 34 people were injured during the clash at Monas on Sunday, when the AKKBB intended to stage a rally in support of Ahmadiyah followers and also commemorate the 63rd anniversary of Pancasila state ideology. One of the victims, Mohammad Guntur Romli, had to undergo surgery for a fractured cheek bone and broken nose after he was beaten with bamboo sticks while trying to protect a woman next to him. ""The government should ban the FPI for their violence,"" the writer of Jurnal Perempuan said. The 30-year-old, who is undergoing medical treatment at the Gatot Sobroto Army Central Hospital in Jakarta, could barely see out of a swollen right eye. Another victim, Dedi C. Achmad, 57, was also treated at the same hospital. ""My case is similar to Guntur's. I could not stand seeing a woman being beaten by the FPI. When I tried to beg them not to hurt her, they beat me with bamboo sticks instead,"" said the Ahmadiyah follower. The police, who deployed 1,200 officers at the scene, did not make any arrests in order to avoid greater chaos, Central Jakarta Police chief Sr. Comr. Heru Winarko said, adding that he was cooperating with the Jakarta Police headquarters to arrest perpetrators of the clash. ""We definitely won't let them wander around without being responsible for their crime,"" he said.

"Tue, June 3 2008",Govt mulls freezing FPI over brutality,"The government is considering suspending the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) for its attack on activists Sunday at the National Monument (Monas). Coordinating Minister for Politics, Law and Security Widodo Adi Sucipto said Monday the government was looking at a 1985 law that allows for the suspension of a mass organization. The decision was made in a meeting led by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Monday evening to discuss proper measures against the hard-liners following the attack. ""We should not only see this problem as a violent action, but as something that may tarnish our country's civilization,"" Widodo told a news conference after the meeting at his office in Central Jakarta. ""We are now conducting strict legal processes in this case,"" he added. Widodo said the President had ordered an investigation of the organization that ambushed activists from the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) at Monas, who were rallying to commemorate the 63rd year of Pancasila state ideology and also to support members of the Jamaah Ahmadiyah Islamic sect. ""I think the Home Ministry will study it further,"" he said when asked about the possibility of the government disbanding the FPI. ""We should put this problem within the context that every mass organization must be in line with the 1985 law."" Under the 1985 law, the government can freeze the central board of a mass organization if it commits an act harmful to order and security, receives foreign assistance without government consent or support foreign parties that could act counter to national interests. Should an organization continue conducting unlawful activities, the law further gives the government power to disband it. However, Attorney General Hendarman Supandji said there should be several steps taken by the government before suspending an organization. ""First, we issue them reprimands, then we go to the Supreme Court,"" he said. Earlier Monday at the presidential office, Yudhoyono condemned the attack and ordered actions to be taken against the perpetrators. ""I am deeply concerned with what happened yesterday afternoon. I strongly condemn the attackers that caused injuries to our people,"" he said. ""Our nation is bound by the law and Constitution and is not a country that supports violent acts. In regard to this incident, the law must be upheld. ""Indonesia is a lawful state, not an anarchic state. We should not be defeated by violent actions."" The President also called on people to maintain order when staging demonstrations and ordered the police to be tough in the face of violence. ""The police should continue implementing preventive measures to avoid similar incidents. Be strict, but do not carry out excessive actions that may instigate new problems,"" he said. Vice President Jusuf Kalla and House of Representatives Speaker Agung Laksono also denounced the attack and asked the authorities to arrest all those behind it. ""The incident has led our nation to sink deeper amid many economic problems including the fuel prices increases,"" Agung said. At a press conference Monday, FPI leader Habib Rizieq Shihab declared war on members and supporters of Ahmadiyah. ""We will never allow for the arrest of a single member of our force before the government dissolves Ahmadiyah. We will fight to our last drop of blood,"" he said. The government remained undecided on when it would issue a decree on Ahmadiyah. ""The joint ministerial decree is still being processed by the Religious Affairs Ministry, the Attorney General's Office and the Home Ministry, and we will announce it later,"" Widodo said. ""In time, the government will issue its decision on this matter.""",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/02/govt-mulls-freezing-fpi-over-brutality.html,,2008
"Tue, June 3 2008",Calls mount for govt to dissolve FPI,"The government has strong legal justifications for disbanding the radical Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and arresting followers who assaulted people rallying for religious tolerance, experts, activists and Muslim scholars said Monday. The call came as condemnation mounted against Sunday's attack by the FPI on activists from the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) to mark the 63rd year of Pancasila state ideology. ""The justice and human rights minister can take legal action by asking the court to disband the hard-line group,"" senior lawyer and presidential advisor Adnan Buyung Nasution said. ""The minister should take the initiative to disband all groups that commit violence in this country."" According to the AKKBB, 70 activists were injured by FPI members, who kicked them and beat them with bamboo sticks. Setara Institute director Hendardi, a legal expert, said the FPI should be dealt with firmly because the group had frequently launched attacks on other groups. He said all groups, including the FPI, that justified violence to achieve their goals should be dissolved. Justice and Human Rights Minister Andi Mattalata said any organization that became a legal entity could be disbanded. He could not say if the FPI was a legal entity registered with his office. ""Don't you see this is the freedom that we have always demanded? You don't like it? This means that freedom is also needed to maintain public order. So don't be angry when we try to curb anarchism,"" Andi said. Buyung also criticized police for failing to intervene in the attack on Sunday. ""It was so surprising that the police just stood there and let the violence happen. They should have immediately arrested the attackers and their leaders,"" he said. Constitutional Court chief Jimly Assiddiqie confirmed the government could take legal action to disband any organization. ""It is the court that has the authority to dissolve an organization,"" he said, adding he would discuss the issue with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. The AKKBB reported the attack to the National Police through its lawyer Asfinawati. It claimed another hard-line group, Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), was also involved in the violence. HTI spokesman Ismail Yusanto expressed concern over the incident, saying it would not have occurred if the government had taken a firm stance against Jamaah Ahmadiyah, an Islamic sect that an official panel declared ""heretical"". Wahid Institute director Yenny Zannuba Wahid said the violence was ""definitely thuggery"". ""The government must be assertive in combating any form of thuggery,"" she said. ""The police should immediately detain all suspects and punish them, especially their leaders. We shouldn't give such people any room to carry out their harmful actions in this country. ""Disbanding a group such as this one will be less effective because they can reappear under other names and identities. The most important thing is punishing its leaders,"" Yenny said. Condemnation against the attack was also voiced by influential clerics in Cirebon, West Java, including Syarief Utsman Yahya, Wawan Arwani, Husein Muhammad, Luthful Hakim, Badrudin and Habib Husein Yahya. They demanded the government take strong action against the FPI attackers and bring them to justice. (trw/alf)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/03/calls-mount-govt-dissolve-fpi.html,,2008
"Tue, June 3 2008",Forum: FPI's attacks against protesters,"That members of the FPI attacked activists of the National Alliance for Religious Freedom at the National Monument on Sunday injuring 34 is alarming and disturbing news. These hard-liners not only tarnish Indonesia's image abroad but are also causing destabilization by violating Pancasila, which is a crime against the nation. Authorities should take immediate action, they should have done this a long time ago. Pluralism in this country is a fact and cannot be eradicated. We do hope that Jakarta Police chief Sr. Commander Budi Winarko keeps his promise by arresting those responsible. These hard-liners are a bunch of criminals and should be treated as such. The police should also arrest those who are the brains behind these attacks. Upholding national stability is the job of the police force, after all. LYNNA VAN DER ZEE-OEHMKE Bogor, West Java We have seen the brutality shown by the group calling themselves the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) upon the National Alliance for Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBP) on Sunday afternoon. Such actions seem to always happen, carried out by the gang of hoodlums bearing the symbol of Islam. Their action is intolerable, and of course, badly tarnishes the image of Islam overall. The government is supposed to disband this group since for a long time their actions have not reflected the teachings of Islam, yet the authorities seem to be reluctant in handling this case. We don't know what made the authorities become so toothless, as we can see the police just deal with minor case and merely against group members in the field instead their leaders, who remain untouchable. So where do this country go, where democracy seems to hardly flourish? ICAL Tangerang, Banten Fatalities on the road -- May 31, p. 7 I can't help but agree with this. Having lived in Bali for quite some years now, I'm still not able to deal with the driving skills, or lack thereof on display. The roads are still mayhem, the drivers have few survival skills and the police seem totally oblivious or disinterested in road safety. Many on the roads simply have no idea how to correctly drive a vehicle and it's little wonder so many needlessly die every week. This is coupled with the poor maintenance of both the roads and the traffic signals (which are largely ignored by the driving public and not enforced by the police). It would be so easy to improve this but there seems to be little desire to on the part of the authorities.

"Wed, June 4 2008","Commentary: FPI acts are a blessing in disguise for SBY, police","If I were President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, I would be very thankful to the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) members for their brutal actions Sunday against activists of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB). If I were the President, I would promote Central Jakarta Police chief Sr. Comr. Budi Winarko for quickly blaming the AKKBB for the violence, and especially for doing little to prevent and stop the attacks. They would be my saviors at this very difficult time. If I were President Yudhoyono, I would try to buy time by delaying the arrest of the people responsible for the violence. To be honest, who would not be afraid of people who appear on TV with no fear because they know the government is powerless against them? Like the President, I also would not have the guts or the interest to condemn and arrest them immediately. If Yudhoyono is afraid of them, it is understandable. The incident is also a good lesson for human rights activists and for Indonesian citizens who naively demand equal rights for all. Constitutional equality is only on paper. Not all people agree with the violence, but also not all people are against the acts of terror. Both parties deserve respect, but the more powerful the party, the more respect -- actually, to be precise, fear -- they can expect. And more importantly, if I were the President, I would be grateful that at least for a while, the FPI violence has diverted the people's anger and attention away from my decision to raise fuel prices and my inability to shed the title ""Mr. Doubtful"". I could not be blamed for Sunday's terror, because I never asked the FPI to attack, and more importantly the group members claim to represent the majority of the population in Indonesia. Don't talk about morals or human rights here. I'm not a scientist. All citizens have their constitutional right to express their views in their own way. In public, I would certainly condemn such brutality and scold my ministers and National Police chief Gen. Sutanto for their sluggish action to uphold the law. The police's harsh tactics to silence student protesters are laudable, as is their lack of action to stop the beatings of AKKBB activists. Don't ask my personal view about the destructiveness. As a civilized person, I still have a conscience. But also do not forget that nothing is personal in politics. Based on political calculations, it is more efficient to let violent groups terrorize the public rather than let the police prosecute the violators. Unfortunately, I am only an ordinary Indonesian citizen. By any standard, I belong to a minority group, whose views and faith are always declared wrong by those who believe God has trusted them to represent the majority of the population. I don't want to be hospitalized just because I express my honest opinion about those who believe that God obliges them to silence those who have a different faith and convictions from them. To be honest, I am a coward in facing people who believe they are free to break my nose and injure my head with their fists, only because I do not belong to their group. It is wrong to conclude that Indonesia's image abroad has been damaged just because CNN reported on the bloody incident. The international community fully accepts the government's explanation that Indonesia is a very peaceful, tolerant, moderate and democratic nation. We are a smiling nation. Indonesia is a great nation, and the world should learn from Indonesia's way of life. And even if it is true that our country is becoming more horrifying, there are many people in this world who like to experience horrors. Indonesia can be a perfect place to satisfy their psychological needs. It is true that we have been told by our religious leaders that we should fight against liberalism, pluralism and secularism. Like our election system, which is based on popular votes, the minority must follow the majority. They must forget their own identity and political aspirations and follow the majority of those who unilaterally claim themselves to be the true representative of the majority. Many Indonesians are outraged by the acts of terror against those who wanted to express their belief in the constitutional rights of freedom of religion and expression. But they do not dare to reveal it in public, because they do no want to be harassed like the AKKBB activists. For those who read this column and disagree with my views, please do not be outraged and beat me up. If you raid my house, please do not torture my wife. She is in a wheelchair, please show her a little mercy. And more importantly, I write this as part of my obligation as an employee of this newspaper company. Nothing personal, please.

"Wed, June 4 2008","FPI members roam freely despite long record of attacks, brutality","Members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) roam freely despite a history of frequently taking the law into their own hands and attacking and burning buildings of other groups. The latest attack blamed on this radical group took place Sunday. At least 70 people were injured in the assault on activists of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB), who were gathered to rally peacefully at the National Monument (Monas) in Central Jakarta. However, no arrests were made by police after the much-condemned attack. ""The police have either so far been defeated by the FPI, or some police officers are working together with the organization for their own benefit,"" activist Rafendi Jamin of the Human Rights Working Group said. He said that only with protection from the police had the FPI managed to survive despite the organization's record of violence. Lawmaker Nadra Izahari of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle concurred, accusing the police of letting the FPI operate outside the law. He cited the attack on the AKKBB activists, saying the police failed to make serious efforts to counter the PFI's violent acts. ""We have reasons to believe the police and the FPI have mutually beneficial relations as the hard-line group has repeatedly committed violence without serious resistance from the police,"" Nadra told a group of activists calling for the FPI's disbanding at the House of Representatives. Many observers have accused the authorities of backing hard-line groups, including the FPI, to counter the movements by pro-democracy and rights organizations or to shift public attention from crucial issues for political reasons. ""We should push for FPI members to receive punishment, but we should not let the problems shift our attention from key issues, such as the recent fuel prices increase and poverty,"" Hendardi of the Setara Institute said. Since its establishment, the FPI has launched dozens of attacks on people or institutions it regarded as insulting or antagonistic to Islam. In June 2000, some 300 FPI members attacked the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) headquarters in Jakarta in a protest against the commission's report on the 1984 Tanjung Priok massacre. Several people were injured in the attack. The FPI was also blamed on late night attacks of nightspots and billiard centers in October 2002, hurting dozens of people. The police reportedly did nothing to stop the attacks. FPI leader Habib Rizieq Shihab was tried in 2002 and put in jail for seven months because of the incident. In December 2006, two policemen were injured when about 100 FPI demonstrators attacked the Playboy Indonesia office in South Jakarta. In April last year, 17 members of the United National Liberation Party (Papernas) were injured in an attack by the FPI during a rally against the newly passed investment law.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/04/fpi-members-roam-freely-despite-long-record-attacks-brutality.html,,2008
"Wed, June 4 2008",Mounting pressure to 'freeze' FPI,"ANTI VIOLANCE: Demonstrators from several of youth, political and social groups in Malang, East Java, rallied Tuesday at the municipal council to demand the government disband the Islam Defenders Front for committing violent acts in the name of religion.( JP/Wahyoe B. ) The government is facing mounting pressure in cities across the country to dissolve the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) for its repeated in violent acts. In Yogyakarta, an unidentified group stormed the FPI office in Sleman at around 11 p.m. on Monday apparently in response to the attack by an FPI-related group on inter-faith activists at the National Monument (Monas) in Jakarta on June 1. One person was injured in the office attack and police held five more. The attack reportedly involved about 100 people with motorbikes and wearing black jackets. The group did not attack FPI members but destroyed the office signboard. They left to avoid a clash with FPI members, who came out with sharp weapons. The attackers were unarmed. However, FPI members stopped five men, beating them with sticks, iron rods and swords. ""We were holding prayers when the thugs attacked us and damaged the signboard. We likened this to waking up a sleeping tiger. We will be harsher and avenge this,"" Yogyakarta FPI commander Bambang Tedi said. The Sleman Police are still identifying the attackers. On the following day scores of people staged a rally in Yogyakarta demanding the government disband the FPI. ""We condemn the (Monas) attack and demand the organization which has damaged democracy and shown disrespect for the spirit of unity in diversity be dissolved,"" said rally coordinator Maulana. In Banyumas, Central Java, a group of 50 people, calling themselves Banyumas Independent Council (Libas) Tuesday stormed the FPI office on Jl. Pungkuran. During the raid no FPI members were present. ""We condemn any form of violence. The country upholds religious tolerance, so we must fight any form of violence and coercion,"" Libas leader Sumbadi said. In Malang, East Java, hundreds grouped in the Greater Malang Anti-Violence People's Alliance on Tuesday held a rally at the local legislature demanding the government forcefully disband the FPI. They also threatened to take the law into their own hands if the government and police failed to immediately take stern action against the group led by Habib Rizieq. They burned an effigy representing Rizieq and forced councilors to address the crowd in support of their action. ""What is happening now reaches the limits of our patience on violent acts committed by them in the name of Islam. There should never be such violence in Indonesia. It puts the nation in jeopardy,"" said rally coordinator Muhammad Syafiq. In the Central Java provincial capital of Semarang, some 30 students took to the streets Tuesday demanding that government disband the FPI. They likened the recent violence committed by the FPI to acts of thuggery. In front of the provincial legislative building, they unfurled banners saying ""Outlaw thugs in robes"", and ""Islam denounces violence"", and repeatedly chanted ""Disband the FPI"". In Jakarta, dozens of FPI members came to the city police headquarters on Tuesday to report the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) as being responsible for the Monas incident. Achmad Michdan, a member of the Muslim Legal Team who is defending Islamic organizations involved in the Monas incident, said he reported 289 activists whose names were in the AKKBB's newspaper advertisements as the masterminds behind the clash. ""They openly had invited a massive number of people in the newspapers and did not get permission from the police to hold the event,"" he said. The FPI also reported Tempo daily newspaper for libel after the newspaper published a photo of the commander of the Islam Troop Command Munarman, choking a man with hundreds of people dressed in white in the background. ""It's a slander. Munarman did not choke a member of AKKBB. The man on the photo is a member of his troop and he did it to prevent the man from taking unauthorized action in the Monas incident,"" Habib Rizieq said. The FPI members brought along with them a man named Nasrullah or Ucok, whom they claimed was the man choked by Murnaman in the photo.

"Wed, June 4 2008",Government slammed for inaction against FPI,"NO TO THUGGERY: Peace activists stage a demonstration at the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle in Central Jakarta on Tuesday. ( JP/R. Berto Wedhatama ) The government came under fire Tuesday for the failure to arrest leaders and members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) over an attack on activists at the National Monument (Monas). Lawmakers, legal experts and activists also demanded the government quickly disband the FPI, arguing that under the law, the group's actions at Monas could be classified as disturbing the peace and causing insecurity in the community. House of Representatives Speaker Agung Laksono slammed the government's stance against the FPI, saying police should have promptly detained the perpetrators. ""It (the attack) is not the first time. If the government had taken strong action against them, then violence like this would not have been repeated,"" he said. Legal expert Frans H. Winarta said all FPI members involved in Sunday's assault should be arrested for breaching the Criminal Code. ""It was a collective attack for which police must arrest all those involved, including their leaders,"" he said. Under the law, people convicted of assaulting others face between two and five years' imprisonment. At least 70 people were injured when FPI members used bamboo sticks to attack members of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion, who were rallying in support of Jamaah Ahmadiyah, an Islamic sect deemed ""heretical"" by a government panel. The peaceful rally was also to commemorate the 63rd anniversary of Pancasila state ideology. Police had made no arrests by Tuesday night, even though President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono had condemned the violence and ordered police to take strong action against the relevant members of the FPI. Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Adang Firman said Tuesday his office had named 10 suspects in the incident and gave them until Wednesday morning to turn themselves in or be arrested. Late Monday night, several police officers visited the FPI headquarters in Petamburan, Central Jakarta. The officers left after an hour-long discussion with FPI leader Habib Rizieq Shihab. They did not make any arrests. Several lawmakers were quick to accuse the police of siding with the radical group over the attack and of being afraid to take action against it. ""We will summon National Police chief Gen. Sutanto to explain why the police allowed the attack to take place, and why they were very slow to take action,"" said Soeripto, a lawmaker with the House's Commission III on legal affairs. Soeripto had been receiving representatives from various organizations, including from Nahdlatul Ulama and the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), who had asked for support for the dissolution of the FPI. Lawmaker Djoko Susilo of the National Mandate Party (PAN) urged the police to arrest Rizieq and other FPI leaders, alleging the attack had occurred under their orders. ""What kind of country do we live in if the police work together with a violent organization? We should uphold the rule of law at any cost to avoid an incident becoming a precedent to legitimize violence,"" he said. Frans said the government could dissolve or freeze the FPI for violating Law No. 8/1985 and government decree No. 18/1986 on mass organizations. Under the law, an organization will be frozen if it disrupts public order and causes public insecurity. ""FPI members have clearly violated the law by attacking others, causing public fear and disturbing the peace,"" Frans said. Home Minister Mardiyanto, Justice and Human Rights Minister Andi Mattalata and Attorney General Hendarman Supandji said they would prefer to concentrate on dealing with individual perpetrators rather than with the organization.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/04/government-slammed-inaction-against-fpi.html,,2008

"Thu, June 5 2008","Get well soon, FPI and other parties","June 1, 2008, will be remembered as a black day in the history of Indonesian democracy. A group of people from different walks of life -- Balinese Hindus, Javanese Catholics, Sumatran Protestants, Buddhists and Confucianists from Celebes and Muslims from all over Indonesia were beaten up by radicals. What was their mistake? They were not Ahmadis, as suggested by Munarman, published on Kompas online service. Indeed, one of them was a Muslim girl belonging to a family aligned with the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI). She was hysterical, she threw away her veil screaming, ""I am ashamed to be a Muslim."" I wonder, if Munarman in the Kompas online article was the same Munarman of Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia. To my knowledge, and from what I have been reading about this organization -- they claim to be non-violent. I hope he is not the same Munarman. For, if he is the same Munarman, that would put him on the spot, for defending the radicals who beat up our Indonesian brothers and sisters when they were demonstrating peacefully, defending and upholding Pancasila as our state ideology. If this is so then he may have to change the image of Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia, which he has so far portrayed as a peace-loving and non-violent organization. The rally at Monas organized by the National Alliance for the Freedom of Religion and Belief was supported by dozens of organizations and many, many prominent citizens of the country. And, it was not to defend Ahmadiyah, or any other sect -- but to defend our state ideology. My dear members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI); my dear Munarman, the defender of FPI and what they did; my dear members of Indonesian Ulema Council -- do please take time to talk to the victims of what happened last Sunday. I did, and my finding was astonishing. They represent our country in its entirety. They belong to different religions. They have different professions. Yet, they stood united to defend our country, its ideology and its Constitution. What happened last Sunday is an insult to Islamic values, as I understand them, as also understood by all my Muslim friends, without a single exception. The language used by Munarman, as published by Kompas in its online edition, does not at all reflect the law of the land. This is why I wonder if it is the same Munarman quoted, or misquoted. For, Munarman of Hizbut Tahrir, to my knowledge, is a man well versed in law. He is a man of law. Les us hope, it was not the same Munarman. Violence is a sickness. We all inherit it from our long evolution from amoeba. As humans, we must polish ourselves and overcome this inherent violence. All religions, all religious teachers and teachings are but tools and medication to that end. FPI, and all the radicals, their supporters and their advocates -- are today in dire need of this tool to polish their souls. They need this medication to heal their beings. So, my dears, please get well soon! His Excellency, our President, has been saying that violence is not the answer. To that I add, ""Love is the only solution."" Try love, my dear friends at FPI, MUI, HTI and other groups which are directly or indirectly, explicitly or implicitly defending or supporting violence and violent acts. Friends, if you feel you have not been doing that, have not been defending or supporting violence, then good for you. You are healed! The police have been sluggish in their move against the FPI mob, quoting religious sensitivities, while religion was used as the justification of the FPI, while beating us, our people, the Indonesians... Reason: It could trigger more riots. Not understandable, not acceptable. If it was your wife, your child, your sibling or your parent being beaten up, what would you, my brother policeman, do? Wouldn't you arrest them on the spot? One of my friends was beaten by an elderly person, in his fifties. One of the youngsters smashed a child against a wall. Several pictures, even videos have been given to the authorities, and now are on YouTube for everone to see and evaluate. The political opponents of the present government see this incident as a ""set up"". The people who attacked the alliance members were prepared with nailed bamboo poles and stones. How could the police let them carry these weapons of violence? ""FPI is supported by some ..."", if the allegations are true then those supporters better begin to count their days before they are exposed. Soon, very soon. The arrogance, with which these radicals, their supporters, defenders and sympathizers have been making statements, prove that they indeed enjoy support of certain people ""up"" there. Many like to believe that all these incidents are set to divert our attention from the core issues faced by the country, such as the oil price increases, et cetera, and et cetera. If the blood of our masses are shed for that purpose -- then shame on all of us. Know the truth, and it shall set you free -- the truth is, our country, our nation, our state, is presently very, very weak. We are unable to hospitalize these radical elements in our society suffering from the contagious sickness of violence. The truth is that if they are not immediately hospitalized, then this entire nation can suffer from the same sickness. There are bound to be reactions, as we have already seen happening in Cirebon.

"Thu, June 5 2008",FPI leader named suspect,"SWEET SURRENDER: Police round up 59 members of the FPI at the group's headquarters in Petamburan, Central Jakarta, on Wednesday. The detained put up no resistance after saying on Monday they would ""fight to the last drop of blood"". (JP/R. Berto Wedhatama) Police on Wednesday questioned Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Habib Rizieq Shihab, declaring him a suspect in Sunday's attack on a peaceful rally for religious tolerance. Rizieq was among 59 members of the radical group who were rounded up by an 800-strong police force at its headquarters in Petamburan, Central Jakarta, earlier in the day. The police said they released four of the 59 people later in the day because they were not involved in the incident. However, Rizieq was still questioned at the Jakarta Police office at around 10:30 p.m, according his lawyer Ahmad Michdan. ""We have named Habib Rizieq Shihab a suspect in protecting and hiding the attackers,"" National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Abubakar Nataprawira said. He said Rizieq would not be detained because he was only threatened with a prison term of nine months. ""We would detain a suspect whose potential punishment term is five years or more,"" he said. The FPI was blamed for a violent attack on activists of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB), who were rallying Sunday at the Monument National (Monas) to mark the 63rd year of Pancasila state ideology. The peaceful rally was also in support of Jamaah Ahmadiyah, a minority Islamic sect dubbed ""heretical"" by a government panel that also recommended a ban on it. The police had earlier said they had identified 20 suspects for playing significant roles in the incident, including Rizieq and Islam Troop Command leader Munarman. National Police chief Gen. Sutanto said Munarman, a former human rights activist, was a ""fugitive"" and currently the target of a police manhunt. ""We ask him to immediately surrender himself to the police, the sooner the better,"" he told the press at the State Palace. ""He publicly said he was responsible for the attack. The police are currently processing this case, so we urge him to give up,"" Sutanto added. Michdan said he had been contacting Munarman's family members since Tuesday evening but still could not find him. Wahid Institute executive director Ahmad Suaedy, who was among some 70 activists injured in the Sunday attack, voiced disappointment with the police for their decision not to detain Rizieq. ""The police should not only charge him with protecting and hiding the perpetrators. They should also hold him as a suspect who must take the responsibility for the incident,"" he told The Jakarta Post on Wednesday. ""He is the top leader of a group that often commits violence in the country. It doesn't make any sense that the police would release such a person."" Legal Aid Center for the Press expert Hendrayana said Article 221 of the Criminal Code allows police not to detain a suspect threatened with less than five years' imprisonment. ""But they have the authority to detain the suspect if deemed necessary. It depends on the case. If the suspect is believed to protect criminals, police could detain him or her,"" he added. Police raided the FPI headquarters early in the morning and detained 59 alleged extremists without significant resistance. Only three days ago, Rizieq said his followers would resist arrest ""to our last drop of blood"" but as police moved in Wednesday he called for calm. ""Please, there should be no one obstructing the duties of the police,"" he told supporters at the scene. On Monday night, several police officers had met Rizieq in his house and left after a one-hour talk without making any arrests. The police said they would announce the number of official suspects in the incident on Thursday. Abubakar said three of the four released detainees, aged under 17 years, admitted they were FPI members, while one did not belong to the hard-line group.

"Thu, June 5 2008",Government indecisive on FPI issue: Anshor,"The local chapter of Nahdlatul Ulama's (NU) Anshor youth wing lodged a report at the Yogyakarta Police headquarters on Wednesday over the assault against its members by Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) members on June 2. ""We have officially filed a report on the attack to the provincial police today,"" Anshor Legal Aid Institute director Akriman Hadi said in Yogyakarta on Wednesday. He said the incident occurred when five Anshor members stopped by the FPI office in Sleman on Monday night after seeing a crowd gathered in front of the office. As they stopped on their motorbikes they were attacked by FPI members, with three of the men sustaining bruises and gashes, according to medical reports. The other two men escaped unhurt. Akriman said the FPI members had also stolen the identity cards of the five men and damaged their motorbikes. On the night of the incident, nearly 100 members from the Anshor and Banser (also affiliated to NU) groups had assembled to discuss a request to secure an event from the Yogyakarta sultanate on June 7, he said. Deputy head of the Anshor regional leadership Arief Fauzi said his party also condemned a separate attack at a peaceful rally at the National Monument (Monas) square in Jakarta on June 1. ""We denounce the violence. The attack and abuse was a criminal act and caused public unrest,"" Arief said. Arief said his group would not resort to violence, as was occurring in other provinces. ""Freedom of association is the right of every citizen and must be respected,"" he said. Anshor will now respond to the violence through legal means and demand police thoroughly investigate all violent acts, Arief said. ""We will never resort to anarchy. We urge the relevant institutions to ban mass organizations that promote violence and leave it to justice to decide,"" he said. In Cirebon, a respected elder at the Buntet Islamic boarding school and member of the advisory council of NU's leadership body, KH Adib Rofi'uddin Izza, said Wednesday that the arrest of FPI leaders and members would be evidence the government was serious about addressing radicalism and violent acts in the name of religion. He urged the government to immediately disband FPI before other people, disgusted with the group's antics, took the law into their own hands. ""The government can only proclaim it is serious about handling violence if it immediately dissolves FPI and other organizations of that ilk, and prosecutes those behind the violence,"" Adib said in Cirebon on Wednesday. The Buntet Islamic boarding school is very influential in NU's circle on both the regional and national level. ""The government should act quickly and be decisive in erasing the perception that it is acting heavy-handedly,"" Adib said. Adib said retributive attacks by NU members in other provinces were due to the government's lack of action in dealing with the problem. ""If the government is hesitant, I'm afraid people will become emotional and take the law into their own hands, such as the case in Cirebon and a number of areas in East and Central Java. If the government is committed, such acts would be impossible. We're concerned the issue could blow out of proportion,"" he said. Antara quoted the leader of the country's largest Islamic organization Nahdlatul Ulama (PBNU), Hasyim Muzadi, as saying on Tuesday that NU rejected efforts by certain organizations to connect it with the attack against activists from the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) at Monas square on Sunday. ""The PBNU regrets the use of NU's name and attempts to involve it in the controversy over the Monas incident,"" Muzadi said. He said following the Monas incident many parties -- both within and outside NU -- were trying to drag NU into the case as a show of strength. The parties had even tried to involve NU in physical clashes with the FPI. ""This should not happen and must be prevented. Physical clashes will harm both sides. We want to settle the Monas incident, not to cause it to escalate,"" he said. He reminded parties who wanted to drag NU into the case, such as Anshor, Pagar Nusa Martial Arts Community and other autonomous bodies within NU, to stop their provocations. ""They have no right to do that and I warn them to stop their provocations. NU will impose sanctions on those who provoke,"" Muzadi said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/05/government-indecisive-fpi-issue-anshor.html,,2008

Or if the police allowed them, police officers have to stand in the middle of them. The police said they thought that AKKBB was in Gambir while the FPI was in front of the presidential office.

FATHULLOH HASAN Bekasi, West Java It has been for several times that the FPI has made headlines with their violent acts. What else are you waiting for? Ban the violent organization. ANDRE Bandung The government is scared of looking un-Islamic, but the FPI is not Islamic -- just a bunch of petty criminal thugs. The whole world sees this and the government should be ashamed. It is seen to be too weak to stop criminals. TARQUIN Jakarta The FPI showed us an attitude of barbarians from an uncivilized world. If we want to live peacefully, the authorities must disband such groups of thugs, but I think they do not dare to punish the group. JASON Jakarta When UNAS students demonstrated and damaged some gates, police were quick to invade their campus and beat them up, but when thugs dressed in white and green beat up peaceful defenseless women, police stood by and did nothing, even blaming the victims for not having a permit! Shame on this cowardly government! HADI Surabaya Mental terror requires terror spectators. The government and the police turn out to be huge fans of this sort of spectacle.

"Fri, June 6 2008",Government seeking no compromise with attackers,"The government says no person or party, including the alleged perpetrators of Sunday's attack against peaceful demonstrators, can hold it hostage or seek compromise when it comes to law enforcement. Presidential spokesman Andi Mallarangeng told reporters Thursday that enforcing the law was the government's main duty as Indonesia had pledged to maintain the rule of law. ""It's just beyond the tolerable limit if someone threatens the state. The government cannot be held hostage by anyone,"" he said. Mallarangeng was responding to a written statement and video recording reportedly sent by fugitive Islam Troop Command leader Munarman to a number of media agencies. Munarman, a former human rights activist, said in the statement he would voluntary surrender if the government banned Ahmadiyah, an Islamic sect declared deviant by the Indonesian Ulema Council and conservative Muslims. The government has delayed issuance of a joint decree on Ahmadiyah almost two months after a government body recommended a ban against the Islamic sect. ""Do not link the issue of violence with the Ahmadiyah decree. There should not be any justification for such brutal action,"" he said. He added that the raid on religious freedom activists at the National Monument (Monas) had nothing to do with the postponed issuance of the decree. ""The President has ordered appropriate legal proceedings against those who committed the attack. And that's what the state should do: enforce the law and protect the people,"" he said. The tough action against attackers of the peaceful rally on Sunday has won credit from many parties, including government critic Abdurrahman ""Gus Dur"" Wahid. The former president, who is known as a champion of religious freedom, however, said the arrest of Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leaders and members was not enough, and that the organization needed to be disbanded given its violent history. The business sector also greeted police actions as much needed measures to maintain peace and order. ""The firm action of the government has relieved us. But it should not be a temporary measure, in order to restore the investors' confidence,"" Bambang Soesatyo of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce was quoted as saying by Antara news agency. He said FPI members had sparked anxiety among industry players as they often raided restaurants and cafes at will. The government, Bambang said, had failed to restore the favorable investment climate in the last decade, mostly because it was unable to create security and public order.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/05/government-seeking-no-compromise-with-attackers.html,,2008
"Fri, June 6 2008","FPI leader officially detained, KLI fugitive still on the run","The Jakarta Police on Thursday arrested Islam Troop Command (KLI) leader Munarman, a main suspect in Sunday’s attack on peaceful demonstrators, after he was on the run for two days. Earlier in the day, the police detained Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab after charging him with violating five articles of the Criminal Code. Munarman’s arrest came after hours of negotiation with criminal-cum-cleric Anton Medan, who facilitated the fugitive’s surrender in a house in Sentul, near Bogor, West Java, kompas.com reported. Former rights activist Munarman was last seen Tuesday when he held a press conference at FPI headquarters in Petamburan, Central Jakarta, to explain an incorrect photo caption published in some newspapers. Munarman, who disappeared Wednesday, sent an email to some media agencies and a video tape to private television station ANtv in Jakarta stating his willingness to surrender to the police once the government banned the Jamaah Ahmadiyah sect. The police on Thursday also released 48 FPI members who had been arrested Wednesday, leaving a total of seven suspects detained for their roles in the attack at the National Monument (Monas). ""The seven suspects are being officially detained at the city police headquarters,"" Insp. Gen. Abubakar Nataprawira told the press here Thursday. He said Rizieq was charged with violating Article 221 of the Criminal Code for sheltering criminals, Article 351 for oppressive acts, Article 156 for spreading hatred, Article 160 for provocation and Article 170 for ambush. Abubakar said the other six FPI members admitted to attacking activists of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) on Sunday afternoon at Monas, Central Jakarta, and signed judicial investigation procedures. Rizieq alone refused to do so. Ari Yusuf Amir, a lawyer of the Muslim Lawyer Team, said he regretted the police decision to name Rizieq a suspect since he voluntarily came to the police headquarters as a witness. ""He refuses to sign it (the judicial investigation procedure) because he has nothing to do with the attack. What is the use of detaining him? The perpetrator was the Islam Troop Command (KLI), not the FPI,"" he said, adding that he would file a pre-trial request. Rizieq said he would trust the legal dealings of the arrested FPI members and himself, as well as the effort to disband Ahmadiyah sect, to the Anti-Ahmadiyah Advocacy group. ""I swear to God that I would prefer being jailed or murdered rather than closing down the FPI. I also demand the police investigate the 289 activists of the AKKBB whom we reported,"" he said. Abubakar said the police put Rizieq in the drugs prison and the other six suspects in the general prison, both at the city police headquarters. ""We separated them to prevent them from influencing each other,"" he said. Abubakar said the six detainees were among 20 identified suspects, while the other 14, including KLI leader Munarman, were named fugitives. Munarman was last seen Tuesday when he held a press conference at the FPI headquarters in Petamburan, Central Jakarta, to explain an incorrect photo caption published in some newspapers. The former human rights activist, who disappeared Wednesday, sent an email to some media outlets and a video tape to private television station ANtv in Jakarta stating his willingness to surrender to the police once the government banned the Ahmadiyah Islamic sect. The FPI was blamed for the Monas attack, which injured at least 70 AKKBB activists who had gathered to commemorate the 63rd year of Pancasila state ideology and to support Ahmadiyah.

"Fri, June 6 2008",Ahmadiyah followers live as usual after Monas attack,"No drastic change has occurred in the predominantly Jamaah Ahmadiyah village of Manis Lor in Jatalaksana, Kuningan regency, following the attack at the National Monument (Monas) on Sunday. Manis Lor Ahmadiyah leader Abdul Syukur said here Wednesday that residents were not affected by the attack or subsequent arrests. ""Daily activities have gone on as usual. We go to work in fear. We perform our prayers in our own homes,"" Syukur said. He said almost all villagers focus their activities inside the village and have been living in fear following the banning by the local administration of Ahmadiyah activities in the regency and the attack on other Ahmadiyah followers in Sukabumi, Bogor, and Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara. Ahmadiyah followers nationwide have been anxious as the central government has yet to issue a decree on the banning of the sect which was labelled heretical by a government body. A number of FPI leaders and members have been arrested amid increasing demands for the dissolution of the hard-line organization. The arrests were made following the Monas attack in which FPI members attacked people gathered to commemorate the 63rd anniversary of Pancasila and to support religious freedom. FPI and other Muslim organizations have for some time demanded the government disband Amadiyah which they say deviates from true Islam. Manis Lor sect elder Kulman Tisnaprawira said Ahmadiyah followers in the village stayed calm in response to the attack. ""We are not easily provoked,"" said Kulman. Both Syukur and Kulman thanked the police for the security in Manis Lor, saying that they had been guarding the village tightly around the clock. They also gave credit to the coordination between the local community and village Ahmadiyah leaders in dealing with any problems related to religious tolerance. ""This makes us resistant to provocation,"" Syukur said. Kuningan police have been on high alert following the Monas attack. At least three groups of police comprising 30 personnel each have been deployed to Manis Lor. ""Another group is ready on call. They are all prepared for the worst scenario,"" Readiness Command chief Adj. Comr. Guntur said, adding that the number of police currently deployed was three times bigger than before the Monas attack. ""We are especially anticipating any possible violence against Ahmadiyah followers as well as attacks on their properties and assets including places of worships and houses,"" Guntur said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/06/ahmadiyah-followers-live-usual-after-monas-attack.html,,2008
"Fri, June 6 2008",Demands for FPI's disbandment continue,"Pressures were mounting for the government to immediately outlaw the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) held responsible for the attack at the National Monument (Monas) on Sunday. Some 30 students from various universities went to the streets in Makassar on Thursday, demanding the banning of the hard-line Muslim organization. ""The violent acts committed by FPI have tarnished religious harmony in the country and clearly violated the 1945 Constitution and basic human rights,"" said rally coordinator Murad. The students also urged the police to arrest and prosecute FPI members who perpetrated the attack and assaulted members from the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) during a rally in Jakarta on June 1. Councilors who received the protesters at the legislative building supported the students' demand, saying no groups were allowed to use violence against others. In Bandung, hundreds of members of the Alliance for Religious Tolerance (AKUR) stormed the FPI's local chapter office on Jl Pasteur on Thursday, demanding the head of FPI's advisory board sign an undertaking to stop using violence in the city. AKUR coordinator Yaman Didu said they had taken this step in order to maintain stability in the West Java provincial capital. ""We don't want people saying they have the right to resort to violence in the name of religion, because every religion teaches peace,"" said Yaman. Bandung FPI's head of the advisory board Ayub Solihin expressed his disapproval of disbandment on the grounds that they were not involved in the Monas attack. ""We have been carrying out peaceful actions in Bandung so far, like other groups. They have no right to disband us,"" said Ayub. He also said none of the FPI members from Bandung were involved in the attack in Jakarta. ""Only the government can dissolve us, not the police, especially not other mass organizations,"" Ayub said. In Cirebon, West Java, thousands of people from various groups and Islamic boarding schools, mostly affiliated with Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), took to the streets Thursday to demand disbandment of the FPI. The demonstrators held rallies at the Cirebon regency police office and the local legislature, arriving in dozens of trucks and with hundreds of motorcycles. Nurjaman, caretaker of the Kempek Islamic boarding school and coordinator of the rally, said the attack carried out by the FPI against one of the NU's clerics and an AKKBB activist, KH Maman Imanulhaq Faqieh, was a dishonor to the NU as an institution. ""The FPI had the audacity to attack a cleric who is an influential figure in the NU. Laskar FPI had also attacked AKKBB activists who were commemorating Pancasila Sanctity Day on June 1, meaning they have dishonored Pancasila and the NU at the same time. We condemn their behavior and insist the government disband the FPI immediately,"" said Nurjaman. Protesters also urged local legislators to immediately enact an ordinance banning the FPI and organizations that disrespected Pancasila and often resorted to violence in the name of religion.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/06/demands-fpi039s-disbandment-continue.html,,2008
"Sat, June 7 2008",Govt warned against reviving authoritarianism,"Human rights advocates have warned that disbanding organizations in Indonesia without fair and proper trial could lead the nation back to authoritarianism. The National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) and poet Goenawan Mohamad, who is also a former chief editor of Tempo magazine, warned the government on Friday, amid mounting calls from rival groups to dissolve the Jamaah Islamiyah Islamic sect and the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Komnas HAM chairman Ifdhal Kasim said disbanding any organization without a comprehensive trial should be avoided. ""Once we give full power to the government to dissolve any organization, the FPI for example, we would turn back to authoritarianism,"" he said. The radical FPI has widely been blamed for a violent attack on a peaceful rally on Sunday for religious tolerance at the Monument National (Monas) square. The attack left 70 activists injured from the National Alliance of the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) opposed to a government plan to ban Ahmadiyah. The FPI is among hard-line groups fighting for the dissolution of the minority Islamic sect. ""It will be proper to bring the case to trial to uphold democracy. Let the court decide whether the FPI is guilty or not. And if it is, then it will be possible to disband FPI,"" Ifdhal said. He said the country recognized freedom of association. ""But it doesn't mean that any organization or association can do whatever they like. We still have to deal with those organizations in a proper way."" Goenawan, a member of AKKBB, also said the government should avoid disbanding organizations, including FPI and Ahmadiyah. However, he demanded the FPI attackers be punished severely according the law. Goenawan, who witnessed the Sunday attack, thanked police for detaining FPI leader Rizieq Shihab and a number of his followers over the assault. However, he said he understood the outrage by supporters of former president Abdurrahman ""Gus Dur"" Wahid against the FPI and Rizieq who publicly bad-mouthed him after the attack. ""About the issue of disbanding the FPI, I personally suggest that we should continue taking into account the right to expression and organization,"" he said. ""It's very dangerous if the government takes the position of easily banning an organization as we experienced in the past during the guided democracy and New Order period,"" Goenawan said in a press statement. He said the nation needed to focus on uniting its citizens. ""The people should be freed from anxiety due to unemployment and poverty as well as from terror and thuggery."" Meanwhile, the Muslim Lawyers Team (TPM) criticized the government for ""discriminatory treatment"" against the FPI in dealing with the Monas attack. At a press conference Friday, TPM lawyer Mahendradatta said AKKBB activists were also to blame because they had provoked the FPI to attack them. He alleged that there had been ""gunfire"" from inside the AKKBB crowd, which incited the attack. The alliance, which has been campaigning for peace and religious tolerance, has strongly dismissed the FPI's allegations as a ""fabrication"". Mahendradatta also criticized police for charging Rizieq with Article 156 of the Criminal Code on hostility act in relation to the attack. ""It's not fair,"" he said. The lawyer said the police should have also charged Ahmadiyah with the same article for religious blasphemy,"" he said. ""Our demand for this has never been responded to.""

"Sat, June 7 2008","The death of reason, the destruction of nation","The condemnation coming from across Indonesia, and the world, for the bamboo-stick ambush by the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) on a peaceful rally by the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion at the National Monument (Monas) is not enough. The following real steps must be taken immediately: ban the FPI officially; arrest all of those involved in the attack, including those who were responsible for planning the action and those who executed it; and more importantly clean Indonesia from any mode of radical thinking. As long as the government of Indonesia has the good will to do so, these two steps are easy, as anyone who loves reasoning would be happy to see it happen. However, the last task needs commitment and patience, and is a long-term task consisting of educating Indonesian society. The actions of radical perpetrators can be seen clearly, whereas radical thinking often remains ignored by Indonesian society. Yet the actions result from thinking. Thus, banning the FPI is only cutting off one of numerous branches, while the tree still stands firmly in its roots and grows. Radical thinking is like a deadly virus. Once it spreads in a body, what a doctor needs is to amputate any parts in which the virus resides. Indeed, it is too late to treat these parts leniently. We are at the curative stage now, not preventive. Yet prevention is still necessary to guard the rest of the body from the spreading virus. The mode of radical thinking is contagious. It is like a plague. Indonesian society must be well prepared to strengthen its immune system. The symptoms of radical thinking can be seen clearly in many of those who have demanded the prohibition of people with different faiths and beliefs, such as Ahmadiyah, to have their basic right as human beings, namely to live peacefully in Indonesia. Ironically, many of those who hold important positions in the government also suffer from this kind of disease. Another common symptom can be detected in those who reject any kind of reasoning. A clear message can be drawn from the ambush in Monas, that only these radical groups have the right to speak, whereas others must be silent. To the radicals, truth and religion run in their blood and breathe, so much so that they feel innocent whenever they use violent means. Moreover, they regard others who use reason to protect themselves as wrongdoers. It is not a good solution, nonetheless, to blame either Indonesian Muslim communities or Islam for providing these seeds of radicalism. It is true, however, that religious jargon often serves as a media to express their radical thinking: in the name of God, scripture and prophets. Radicalism has to do with society as a whole and its leadership. Whenever the leadership in society is weak, radical groups try to steal it. Particularly, in the aftermath of the increase of fuel prices, the hope to live decently is also sinking. The current government is often seen to have failed with the economy. If the stomach is empty due to the soaring price of basic needs, people are easy to get mad. Against this backdrop, the seeds of radical thinking and action find fertile soil to grow. Moreover, radicalism in Indonesia has grown rapidly due to the remaining failure of Indonesian society and the government to build a true democratic and prosperous society. In turn, all Indonesians, regardless of their faith, ethnicity or cultural background, should shoulder the burden of this mistake for allowing radicalism to grow. It should also be borne in mind that the victims whom radical groups have attacked are people with various religious backgrounds -- be they Muslim or non-Muslim. Radicalism, thus, should become a concern for all of us. It is therefore difficult to accept the statement made by the minister of religious affairs, Maftuh Basyuni, whose idea is to prevent non-Muslims from intervening in the case of Ahmadiyah. It is clear that the idea of banning Ahmadiyah has little to do with theological discussion. Instead, it has more to do with the basic rights of being Indonesian: the right to live, to believe and to practice whatever faith they believe. Moreover, this has become a concern of all people around the world, a concern to which the United Nations has already paid attention. Given this fact, the government has no choice between banning Ahmadiyah or the FPI and the likes. Who the government should ban is clear: the FPI, which has often violated basic human rights and has put Indonesia in danger. Indonesia was founded by intellectual leaders who demonstrated fine reasoning in many debates against the Dutch colonial rulers, not by those who used mythical bamboo sticks in battle. Many victims of the Monas ambush are young intellectuals, the nation's best resources, who sought to inherit that reasoning in guarding this nation by commemorating the birth of state ideology Pancasila (the Five Principles), a ceremony that was designed to be full of reasoning and love in guarding the diversity of Indonesia. The FPI, on the other hand, who answered this with the bamboo stick, would bring this nation to nowhere but destruction.

"Sat, June 7 2008",Manhunt for fugitive Munarman intensifies,"Rights champion-turned-Muslim hard-liner Munarman has borrowed a page from Noordin M. Top, the fugitive No. 1 terror suspect, in using the media to argue his case while in hiding. Police said they have been hunting down Munarman, the Islam Troop Command (KLI) leader who claimed responsibility for the attack on participants of a pro-tolerance rally on Sunday, as far as the West Java border. Cirebon Police chief Sr. Comr. Susno Duadji said Friday no less than 1,000 officers were involved in the manhunt in his jurisdiction alone. ""The National Police chief has ordered us to comb the West Java and Central Java border to locate Munarman,"" he said. Police denied The Jakarta Post 's report yesterday that Munarman had surrendered in Sentul, near Bogor, West Java, on Thursday night. A friend of Munarman had stated the latter would like to give himself up to the police rather than being arrested. ""Munarman has not surrendered or been arrested. Our personnel are still chasing him,"" Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Adang Firman told reporters Friday. ""It will not be difficult to arrest him, but it takes time."" Police had reportedly searched for Munarman at his home in Pondok Cabe, Tangerang, and have tried to monitor his movements in Jakarta and Banten since he disappeared and refused to heed the police's call for voluntary surrender on Wednesday. Emulating bomb maker Noordin and al-Qaeda terror group leader Osama bin Laden, Munarman sent a video recording to a private TV channel and emails to the media from his hideout. In his statement, he demands the President outlaw the minority Ahmadiyah Islamic sect in exchange for his surrender. To help police capture Munarman, the directorate general of immigration slapped a travel ban on the suspect. ""The ban comes into effect as of today for 20 days. We have received an official request from the criminal division of the National Police,"" Syaiful Rahman, head of the investigation and action division at the immigration office, said Friday. The travel ban can be extended up to one year upon the request of the Attorney General's Office. The police have so far detained eight suspects of Sunday's National Monument attack, including leader of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) Rizieq Shihab. The latest detainee, arrested in Karawang, West Java, on Friday, was an FPI member named Mohammad Subahan. One of Rizieq's lawyers, Ari Yusuf Amir, said he would challenge the city police by filing a pre-trial lawsuit on Monday. ""The arrest was illegal because the police neither showed an arrest warrant nor explained the reason for arresting Habib Rizieq,"" he said. On Friday afternoon more than 100 people swarmed police headquarters to show their support for the FPI leader. Among the visitors were chairman of the Indonesian Ulema Council Kholil Ridwan and Ali Mocthar Ngabalin, head of the Central Board Council of the Indonesian Mosque Youth Assembly and a legislator who met with the detainee shortly after visiting hours were over. Ali said he was ready to gather signatures from fellow House of Representatives members to bail Rizieq from detention.

"Sun, June 8 2008",By The Way: FPI too busy talking to God,"Christians are so close to God that they call Him ""father"" in prayer, while Muslims are so far away from Allah that they need loudspeakers to talk to Him. This is an old joke, but I couldn't tell you earlier because I was afraid. If Rizieq Shihab had found out, he might have beaten me black and blue or, worse, burned down my house. Thank God, he is now in police custody. If you happen to have watched the news (not the saucy gossip shows or soap operas) or read the paper recently, you would know of Rizieq, the leader of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). A radical group, FPI, attacked members of the National Alliance for Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB), who were rallying last Sunday at the National Monument (Monas) park to mark the 63rd anniversary of Pancasila state ideology. The FPI made their attack because the alliance supports Jamaah Ahmadiyah, a minority Islamic sect dubbed ""heretical"" by a government panel which also recommended it be banned. The hardliners had earlier attacked Ahmadiyah sect members, their houses and mosques, and called Ahmadiyah a deviant sect. The sect leader was once accused of blasphemy, but other than that I have never heard of the sect's members committing theft, robbery, murder or any other crimes listed in the Criminal Code. If they have their own interpretations of some verses in the Koran, it is only God who could decide whether it is right or wrong. In 2006, FPI members vandalized the Play Boy magazine offices in South Jakarta, when the magazine first published its Indonesian version. They said the publication could damage people's morality, but perhaps the real reason was that they were disappointed to find the Indonesian version didn't have the same 'hot' pictures as its American parent. They had also repeatedly attacked cafes, bars and nightspots during the Ramadhan fasting month because they believed the establishments violated existing regulations and would tarnish the Holy month. And they committed all these violent acts in the name of God. Frequently FPI members shouted ""Allahuakbar"" (God is Great) while conducting their anarchic deeds. They also prayed a lot. Praying five times a day is one of the five pillars of Islam followed by, not only FPI members, but all Muslims around the world. The Muslim call to prayer, and prayer itself, can be heard in every corner of the city. It would seem it is a case of the louder, the better, so that everyone in the neighborhood can hear it. It doesn't matter if it is still dawn or if it's during school hours and the mosque is right next to a school. If one mosque is next to another, they may even compete to be loudest. On Friday, mosques are crowded with congregations who enthusiastically come to pray and listen to preachers. Non-Muslims also perform their religious rituals devoutly. Churches are always full on Sundays, when Christians and the Catholics pray and praise the Lord. Indonesia is indeed one of the most religious nations in the world, a fact confirmed by last year's religion monitoring study conducted in 21 countries by the German-based Bertelsmann Foundation. Ironically, Indonesia is also notorious for being among the world's most corrupt countries. Being religious, corruptors must pray first before stealing state money, or perhaps they set aside a little of the corrupted money to build mosques or churches. Another indicator of the strength of religion in Indonesia was in the huge number of people who enjoyed the recent movie Ayat-Ayat Cinta (Verses of Love), which is heavily loaded with religious messages. President Soesilo Bambang Yudhoyono who watched the blockbuster along with several cabinet ministers reportedly shed tears because he was so touched by the story. But many joked, saying he had cried because he shared the pain of not being allowed to have more than one wife like the leading role. Anyway, following the Monas attack, many people (mostly Muslims) demanded the ban of the FPI and some even called its members preman berjubah (thugs in Muslim robes) as they wore long white robes and headscarves during the violence. Not only FPI members, but it seems many other Muslims, Christians and other deeply religious people are often too busy talking to God in one-way conversations, praising and worshiping God, reading the Koran, the Bible and other holy books, while turning their backs on fellow human beings. Of course, talking to God is important, but if they think praying five times a day or going to Church every Sunday, or even everyday, is enough to allow them climb the stairway to heaven, maybe they should think again. By the way, if you find the opening of this piece offensive, please accept my apology. I don't mean to upset anyone, let alone God, who must be sad enough seeing the violence and frequent religious conflicts within this so-called religious nation. -- T.Sima Gunawan",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/08/by-the-way-fpi-too-busy-talking-god.html,,2008

Are they afraid to loose the vote of such a large Islamic group? Or perhaps they are not capable enough to take action? ISKANDAR Tangerang, Banten The government is too lenient to the leaders and members of the FPI. It should have been the government's job to do something in this case. Dissolve the organization so that this can become a deterrence or shock therapy for other organizations not to do such an action that irks public security. CATHERINE Medan, North Sumatra The government doesn't have the courage to take action against the Islam Defenders Front. FPI will continuously take the law in its own hands. FUJI MULIAWATI Bandung The modern democratic state is just like football. In football if you kick or hit another player badly you will be given a red card and sent off the field.

The leaders of the FPI have their own political agenda. Ban them. GIBSON Jakarta Given the violent track record of the FPI and the 1200 police just watching the attacks on a peaceful demonstration, there are only two explanations. First, Islamic parties in SBY's government are preparing for a Republic Islam Indonesia. Second, Indonesia is becoming a failed state unable to protect its citizens and the Constitution.

"Mon, June 9 2008","Letter: Securing pluralism, securing Indonesia","This nation is built on different tribes and cultures that have come together to share the same values and destiny. This is our unique character, all along while nations like Yugoslavia tumbled due to ethnic and religious strife. If we want to survive as a great nation for another century, then we must make sure that we are mindful and respectful toward one another's beliefs, while at the same time forging a united identity under state ideology Pancasila. If we don't believe in what we are today, we will fall one day. Radicalism has truly become the greatest threat to our survival as a nation. It is time to put everything back in order. Anyone or any organization that tries to put themselves above the state and force its beliefs on the people must be considered an enemy of the state. Such acts must be considered high treason against the nation. The FPI has long tried to set itself as a state within a state. Its members go around destroying the tolerance and peace among our diverse people. By such acts, it has put Pancasila in jeopardy. It fights for its own brand of religion first and foremost, never for the country. Indonesia must remain secular for the sake of its survival. Our nationalism should never be based on a particular religion. The government must fast make a move against the FPI and a clear message must be sent to the people that religious-based intolerance and arbitrary acts of violence will never go unnoticed and will be dealt with according to the law. And it is time also for us to realize one thing - one can never govern morality by laws. Forget about imposing sharia-based laws on the people, it will only create hypocrisy and social division. If anything, all morality starts at home. What we need is education for parents and a culture of thoughtfulness for others. It's time to think rationally, not crazily.

"Mon, June 9 2008",FPI foes ready to take up arms,"Dissatisfied with the government's reaction to violence by the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), an alliance of religious organizations in Jember regency, East Java, is preparing a special force to launch a strike at the hard-line group. The alliance is affiliated with Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), Indonesia's largest Muslim organization, and the National Awakening Party (PKB). The force will be divided into 300-member groups to undergo special training in self-defense and the use of knives, machetes and other traditional cutting tools in a training field in Sucopengetok village, 25 kilometers from Jember. A large number of self-defense instructors were coming down from mountainous areas in the regency to train the combatants recruited from Garda Bangsa, Batuan Serbaguna, Anshor and a number of Islamic pesantren (boarding schools) in the regency, Ayub Junaidi, coordinator of the force and secretary of the Jember branch of the PKB told The Jakarta Post here Saturday. ""If the FPI is not disbanded, the special force will leave for Jakarta to do it,"" Ayub said. Ayub said the training would be conducted in groups and would be completed within several months. ""All participants will be trained physically and mentally so they will be able to endure the worst situations."" He said the special militia was not being reestablished to create public unrest but to put an end to that created by the FPI and its affiliated organizations. The special force was originally founded in 2000 and was deployed to the State Palace to support President Abdurrahman ""Gus Dur"" Wahid, who was facing increasing pressure to resign. Ayub said all Muslim organizations in East Java were opposed to the FPI, which used violence in the name of Islam, a religion, he added, that actually sought to create peace on the planet. He said the government must disband the FPI, which had acted against the law, endangered national unity, discredited the 1945 Constitution and risked authoritarianism. He also said Muslim people and organizations in East Java were disappointed with the police's failure to take strong actions against the FPI, despite the group's history of violence. Another militia group has been prepared at Soko Tunggal Islamic Boarding School in Semarang, led by cleric Nuril Arifin Husein. The group was ready to take on the FPI, Nuril said Saturday. ""The FPI is only a small group of Muslims, but behaves as if it were the biggest one. Its members like to force their will on others and take the law into their own hands,"" Nuril said. Nuril said he did not agree with FPI leader Rizieq Shihab. ""From where in the world does the FPI's brand of Islam, which tends to ridicule clerics, come from? What kind of teaching is Rizieq spreading?"" Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono said the FPI was the result of social conditions. ""Beyond the merits of banning or not banning the FPI, as long as there are 9.8 million unemployed and 36 million living below the poverty line, there will always be angry young men and women attracted to various streams of radicalism, Islamic or otherwise,"" the minister said in Jakarta on Sunday. ""They (the FPI) skillfully position themselves as defenders of the humiliated, young and marginalized urban poor fighting the evils of bars, nightclubs and other symbols of decadent foreign secularism."" Juwono reminded people that 10 years ago, the then Jakarta Police chief was a patron of the FPI. ""The important thing is that sympathy for the FPI has effectively been eradicated from the hearts and minds of most mainstream Muslims in Indonesia,"" he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/09/fpi-foes-ready-take-arms.html,,2008

"Tue, June 10 2008",SMS: FPI attacks,"The government is too cowardly to take any strong action because they are trying to keep everyone happy. As a democratic government, it is their job to satisfy the desires of every citizen but they know that no matter what decision they make, there is always someone who will complain. They have enough trouble already on the food and fuel problems that they decided to fix one problem at a time by neglecting the FPI issue first. In addition, the Islamic vote for next year's election is too critical to risk a showdown with the FPI. CASSANDRA Tangerang, Banten I do not think the reason for this incident is corruption in the government, but that the government has focused more on building Indonesia's infrastructure and less on keeping its people safe and sound. Therefore, the first and most important thing for the government to do is enforce the law by stopping riots and pursuing criminals for the sake of the development of the country and its people. That is the purpose of the government in Indonesia. MICKEY K. S. Jakarta First of all, I am shocked by the government's reaction. A number of people have been attacked by the FPI, yet the government was unable to stop them. This incident seems odd somehow. Why has an organization as violent as the FPI never been hindered? There might be a connection between the two. Corruption might be one of the reasons. SUNG Tangerang, Banten The authorities have turned a blind eye on peaceful men, women and children celebrating Pancasila state ideology and religious tolerance. Who knows if they'll fail to protect the rest of us. I do not know for sure if our leaders are directly affiliated with the FPI but I know that ""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men (and women) to do nothing"". GIOVANNI TANZIL Jakarta The government of Indonesia is as frail as a feather in the wind. It is pressured by the issues that will not help Indonesia strive for social justice. Corruption may just be the reason as to why there hasn't been a motion to stop the violence that was inflicted. I know that money has its benefits, but it has brought a sense of humiliation for the Indonesian people who are willing to earn a quick buck in exchange for leniency towards violent acts. Well, if corruption isn't the case, it might just be the fact that favors from such Islamic groups is of great importance to the current government. For the time being, I simply cannot understand why there hasn't been a motion to secure the safety of the innocent from such violence, but what I do know is that ""evil prevails when good people do nothing"". ERIC KURNIAWAN Tangerang, Banten Because they simply don't have the guts to take a stand on any issue that confronts the Muslim majority. GARY Jakarta The government should have been very much able to stop such an attack. They have failed to do so simply because they have chosen to ignore what has happened. However their lack of action will only ignite the members of FPI to think they can do whatever they want without any real consequences. I find it absurd that the government chose to turn a blind eye to the attacks, in a day where our nation celebrates the anniversary of Pancasila, no less. How are we to trust our own government when it has failed to stand up to those who have so visibly scarred our nation's motto, Bhinneka Tunggal Ika (unity in diversity)? BRIGITTA Jakarta President SBY, what are you doing? You have to take strong action against them because our country is plural and democratic. LEON Sampit, Central Kalimantan I refer to the article, ""Our state of lawlessness"". The Islam Defenders Front attacking a group of men, women, and children promoting the freedom of religion; does that sound ironic? Besides the fact that we are a major Muslim nation, does it not sound ironic that the ""defenders of Islam"" are clubbing innocent people who are promoting the freedom of religion? I was surprised to see the FPI justified their actions against another Muslim sect, Ahmadiyah. Not to say that Ahmadiyah is innocent, but beating up peaceful, Pancasila-promoting protectors is simply uncalled for. I praise our President for so quickly condemning and responding to the incident. However, whether or not social justice will be carried out is another question. ANDREW Tangerang, Banten I have a different point of view. I think there are some people who direct all this like a director behind the scenes, and play intelligent as the actor on the field. Kudos to them for their success in fighting Islam as the lamb until the Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) misunderstanding, urging the FPI to be dispersed, not Ahmadiyah. REZA Bandung The reason the government acted this way was because it is afraid of what the FPI might do to it if it defies them. There is even a bigger chance that the government is illegally supporting the FPI. It is clearly seen that the police could have easily taken down the FPI but they decided to let them go after ransacking nightclubs and such. It could be true that both the FPI and government are on the same side, believing that Ahmadiyah is an illegal sect and needs to disappear. But the outcome and verdict of this problem? We'll find out soon enough. JASON UTOMO Jakarta No one dies at the hands of the FPI; don't exaggerate. And please disband Ahmadiyah first.

"Tue, June 10 2008",Is the FPI radical?,"The recent Monas violence, in which members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) physically attacked members of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Religion and Faith, has highlighted the former's violent tendencies. Its previous mass rallies and its sweeping actions against nightlife centers, particularly during the fasting month of Ramadhan, have often ended violently. This appears to show they are resolute in their purpose, i.e. to put into practice religious (read: Islamic) virtues and to fight against evil. The FPI is then widely perceived as a radical fundamentalist Islamic organization. However, a study by Muslim scholar Al-Zastrouw Ngatawi shows this common perception is misleading. In his research, Zastrouw scrutinizes the FPI's organizational structure, the social origins of its leaders and followers, the historical context of its emergence, its relations with other Muslim organizations and its networks with military elites. He observes their everyday religious practices, their interaction with surrounding communities, the religious events they organize and so on. He then comes to the conclusion that the is not as radical and fundamentalist as it's made out to be. Unlike other Islamic organizations emerging in the last 10 years such as Hizbut Tahrir, Majlis Mujahidin, Laskar Hizbullah etc., the FPI's concern is practical (in political and economic terms) rather than theological or ideological. They focus on religious symbols rather than on religious doctrines. Islam, or what appears to be Islamic concerns, are exploited to provide religious legitimacy in defense of political and economic interests. Islam is thus positioned as the veil rather than as the core of what they strive for. Islam is ""hijacked"" for nonreligious interests. Therefore, one should perceive FPI not as a radical fundamentalist Muslim organization, but rather as a political organization fronting as radical Islam. In this way Zastrouw suggests the FPI looks radical, in the sense of leaving hardly any space for compromise with its perceived opponents. Yet, its ""radicalism"" is closely related to its practical interests rather than to religious doctrines. What they struggle for is not really establishing an Islamic state or advocating Islamic sharia law, but rather on improving access to political and economic resources with which they can gain social mobility. This is inseparable from the social origins of its founders and its historical context. Founded in August 1998 by a number of habib (religious clerics) who claim to be the descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, the FPI has become a vehicle for hire, sustaining social and economic privileges for its founders, whose businesses failed during the monetary crisis of 1997. In the name of struggling for social order based on Islamic tenets, the FPI attracts Muslims from all walks of life, especially those who feel marginalized. Due to its rapidly increasing numbers of ""members"" and sympathizers, the FPI has become an Islamic mass organization with some bargaining power. Instead of offering a transformative agenda for Muslim communities, the FPI offers an instrument ready to be used by political elites needing religious legitimacy, in exchange for economic and material gains. Given the nature of the movement, coping with the FPI, for example by dissolving it, since it has quite often acted illegally, should not be such a hard job. So long as its patron-client links with military elites are severed, it would not be as strong as it might appear. Turning religious symbols into economic commodities for sale without enough material support would no longer be attractive to its followers, as it is doubtful that they really have strong religious convictions. The disbanding of this organization then helps restore the moderate image of Indonesian Muslims. Otherwise, it is not only the image of Indonesian Muslims, but also the existence of the nation itself which is at risk, as the aggressiveness of the FPI has caused some serious conflicts within society and politics. There is no reason for the state not to ban an organization which has clearly threatened the existence of the nation. Isn't it legitimate for the state to safeguard the existence of the nation?

"Tue, June 10 2008",Monas rally attack fugitive surrenders,"The leader of the Islamic Troop Command (KLI) turned himself in to the Jakarta Police on Monday night for questioning over his role in the June 1 violence at the National Monument. MUNARMAN: ( JP/R. Berto Wedhatama ) Munarman presented himself at Jakarta Police Headquarters at about 8 p.m. after more than a week in hiding. He said he decided to surrender after learning the government had issued a joint ministerial decree banning Jamaah Ahmadiyah -- a minority Islamic sect -- from carrying out any activities. ""I have fulfilled my promise and proved that I am not a coward. I said in a videotape last week that I would surrender after the government disbanded Ahmadiyah,"" he said. The government announced on Monday a ministerial joint decree that ""forbids Ahmadiyah followers from doing activities and spreading interpretations that deviate from Islamic teachings"". These activities include preaching that there is another prophet after Muhammad. Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Ketut Untung Yoga Ana confirmed Munarman's surrender. ""We are currently questioning Munarman. He was accompanied by his lawyer upon his arrival at city police headquarters,"" he said. Last week, Munarman publicly claimed responsibility for the June 1 attacks on peaceful marchers at the National Monument (Monas). The violence left at least 70 members of the National Alliance for Freedom of Faith and Religion injured. The alliance members were marching to commemorate the 63rd anniversary of Pancasila state ideology and to show support for Ahmadiyah. Munarman, the former chairman of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation, said he did not try to evade arrest by fleeing after police named him a suspect on June 4. ""I did not run away from my responsibility. I was in hiding, waiting for the government's firm decision on Ahmadiyah,"" he said. He said he regularly contacted his lawyer, Lukman Nur Hakim, but he did not tell anybody where he was hiding. ""I was the one who called him. Nobody could contact me,"" he said. He did appear in public last Tuesday, when he held a press conference at the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) headquarters in Petamburan, West Jakarta, the same day Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Adang Firman issued an ultimatum to FPI members involved in the Monas attack to surrender. On Wednesday at 6 a.m., around 800 police officers were deployed to the FPI headquarters to arrest 59 members, including the group's leader, Rizieq Shihab. The police later released 52 of those taken into custody. Rizieq has been charged with violating Article 221 of the Criminal Code for sheltering criminals, Article 351 for oppressive acts, Article 156 for spreading hatred, Article 160 for provocation and Article 170 for assault.

"Tue, June 10 2008",Editorial: To ban or not to ban,"Have sympathy for President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who must be having one of those sleepless nights again as he has to make two potentially contentious rulings in the next few days. Pressures have mounted on the former general, not known for making swift decisions, to rule on whether to ban Ahmadiyah, a religious sect declared by conservative Islam as heretical, and also to ban the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), which was responsible for the attack on a peaceful interfaith rally at the National Monument (Monas) in Jakarta early this month. It does not help his case that the two issues are related. The FPI has been at the forefront in demanding the President implement a recommendation from a government panel to ban Ahmadiyah, to the point of making physical attacks on the group's property in many places around Indonesia. FPI leaders have justified their violent behavior at Monas on June 1, saying the rally participants who were demanding government guarantees to defend freedom of religion were essentially supporting Ahmadiyah. Should Yudhoyono ban only one of them? Which one? Or should he ban both? Although each is its own case, how he decides has consequences on his political image and reputation. Ignoring these two competing demands is not an option, coming as they are from influential groups and public figures. Leading the camp in calling for Ahmadiyah's ban is the conservative Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), which earlier came out with a fatwa (Islamic edict) declaring Ahmadiyah not only un-Islamic, but also a threat to Islam. This demand finds widespread support among conservative Muslims as well as radical groups like the FPI which did not hesitate to ""enforce"" the fatwa in the absence of government action. Leading the other camp calling for a ban on the FPI is former president Abdurrahman ""Gus Dur"" Wahid and many prominent national figures who have grown tired of the way the group always finds its way to impunity after each physical attack. The Monas violence must have come as the last straw for Gus Dur; he dispatched Banser and Ansor, militias and youth organization under the Nahdlatul Ulama Muslim organization which he once chaired, to confront the FPI in many towns in Java. In some places, this led to the local FPI branches to dissolve themselves. It was also after a lot of public pressure that the police eventually arrested some of the FPI members involved in the Monas attack, and after more public criticism, to detain FPI leader Rizieq Shihab and declare him a suspect on multiple charges connected with the violence. The bad news for the President is that these issues aren't likely to go away with time. The longer he delays his decisions, the louder the demands are getting. The Monas clash reminds us that the two sides might collide again as they press on with their demands. It is unlikely that they would stop their action if the President decided not to bow to pressures and ruled against banning either organization. What about banning both of them outright? This seems to be the obvious choice. After all, the President has the recommendation of a panel made up of representatives from the National Police, the Attorney General's Office, the ministry of religious affairs and the ministry of home affairs, as well as the MUI fatwa to ban Ahmadiyah. And police must by now have sufficient evidence of the FPI's alleged criminal acts to have the organization banned. Not so fast, Jose. Banning any of these groups will have political consequences. With Yudhoyono facing an election a year away, outlawing Ahmadiyah or the FPI, or both, could cost him politically. Outlawing Ahmadiyah would raise the issue of freedom of religion, which is guaranteed by the Constitution. It would also set a precedent for the government to tamper with the substance of religion, raising questions of where do you draw the line? It was bad enough that the government failed to protect Ahmadiyah from FPI attacks. A government ban on Ahmadiyah would send a signal that the state officially sanctions persecution of people on the basis of their faith. The President is committing an impeachable offense if he goes ahead and implements the recommendation. Banning the FPI is also going to set a precedent, unless the police go through the lengthy and time consuming process. There will also be strong reactions from the conservative Islam groups, none of which seemed to be disturbed by the violence perpetrated by the FPI against a peaceful demonstration, which included children and women. Would the President dare upset conservative Islam ahead of an election year? Time will tell. In both the Ahmadiyah and FPI cases, President Yudhoyono faces a catch-22 situation. Whether he bans them or not, it could affect his political standing. He probably needs to sleep on it a few more nights to reach a decision -- that is, if he can sleep at all.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/10/editorial-to-ban-or-not-ban.html,,2008
"Tue, June 10 2008",Govt calls it a day for Ahmadiyah,"POLAR APPOSITES: Members of hard-line Islamic groups raise flags during a rally in front of the Presidential Palace in Jakarta on Monday to demand the government disband Islamic sect Ahmadiyah. The rally attracted about 5,000 people. ( JP/J. Adiguna ) The government, bowing to intense pressure from extremist groups, has ordered Jamaah Ahmadiyah to stop all religious activities or face legal prosecution. A joint ministerial decree banning the activities of the minority Islamic sect was issued Monday, the same day thousands of hard-liners gathered in front of the Presidential Palace to demand the government move against the group. The government said the regulation was effective from Monday, but set no deadline for Ahmadiyah to halt its activities or face prosecution. The decree, signed by Religious Affairs Minister Maftuh Basyuni, Home Minister Mardiyanto and Attorney General Hendarman Supandji, also stopped short of explicitly banning or dissolving the sect. ""There is no disbandment,"" Hendarman said after the issuance of the joint decree. The document orders Ahmadiyah followers to turn to the beliefs of the ""mainstream Islam"". It prohibits the sect from ""spreading interpretations and activities that deviate from the principal teachings of Islam"". Such activities include ""the spreading of the belief that there is another prophet with his own teachings after the Prophet Muhammad"". Ahmadiyah believes its founder, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, not Muhammad, is the last prophet of Islam, defying one of the basic doctrines of the religion. It is not clear if the decree means that Ahmadiyah followers, numbering around 200,000 in the country, are still allowed to worship in private. FINAL JUDGEMENT: Religious Affairs Minister Maftuh Basyuni leaves a press conference after announcing a joint ministerial decree on Islamic sect Ahmadiyah at his office in Jakarta on Monday. ( JP/R. Berto Wedhatama ) ""As long as they claim themselves to be Muslims, they must stop believing that there is another prophet after Muhammad. And as Muslims, they have to follow the mainstream teachings of Islam,"" Basyuni said. ""If we find them continuing with their misinterpretation of Islamic teachings, they will face legal action,"" the religious affairs minister said. The decree also warns of legal prosecution for those attacking Ahmadiyah followers. The attorney general said anyone attacking sect members could be charged under the law on hate crimes. In a news conference late Monday at the Wahid Institute in Jakarta, the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) slammed the decree as unconstitutional. The alliance plans to file a lawsuit against the government over the decree in the next two to three days, saying the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. ""It proves that the government can be pressured by hard-line groups,"" said Wahid Institute executive director Ahmad Suaedy, also an AKKBB member. The ministerial decree came as thousands of hard-liners threatened to launch jihad, or holy war against Ahmadiyah during an angry protest in downtown Jakarta. The protest, which started at 9:30 a.m. outside the presidential office, caused heavy traffic congestion, forcing police to reroute traffic, including Transjakarta buses, from several main thoroughfares. The protesters, from several hard-line groups including the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia, then marched to Jakarta Police Headquarters on Jl. Sudirman, where FPI leader Rizieq Shihab is being detained. They demanded police release Rizieq, who is accused of leading a violent attack on pro-pluralism activists from the AKKBB on June 1 at the National Monument (Monas). Police on Monday seized a knife from one protester, identified as Burhani, 28, and arrested him. ""I use it to peel apples ...,"" Burhani told reporters. Rizieq was brought from his detention cell to meet with his supporters for around five minutes. In a short speech, he demanded the dissolution of Ahmadiyah.

Our country will fall apart because of them and the government is only catching 59 members! As I've heard they only have about 25,000 members, how many police forces, to start a coup d'etat! I was disgusted when I heard the FPI would ""fight to the last drop of blood"" if police dared to raid them. These are the police we have? How many army personnel are in Indonesia? Or should we ask help from another country? FARMAN S. A. Jakarta The government won't uphold justice unless pressure groups could force the government economically. We must overview the FPI's history. Isn't it true the FPI was founded by the military? NATALIA Jakarta On numerous occasions, the FPI has made brutal attacks on people and property while the police just looked on without making arrests. Also no action by the government. Both are afraid of the FPI. The police will attack AND chase students but not the FPI. Action is taken only after wide protests including from the United States and prominent Muslim figures. Government uphold justice? Not likely. No guts! EDDY T. Depok, West Java. I hope the government is not half-hearted in upholding justice in this country. If they were, then I would say: Way to go. If not, then I would say nothing. RUDY D. SALIM Jakarta I doubt the government and police would dare taking strong actions against the FPI. The FPI funding seems very strong. And their leaders are very smart looking at how they react against accusations. The FPI movement is really effective to disintegrate the nation and to create chaos. MELA Jakarta I think the government will uphold justice in this case. They have arrested members and leaders of the FPI who helped Munarwan to run away. I hope they will be punished for what they did. I hope it and other anarchic organizations will be banned. DULI MUHLIS MUNAWAR Depok The government has no courage when it comes to radical Islamic groups. They will take the easy way out. Perhaps more time to study the situation. MICHAEL Surabaya We all know there is mutual cooperation between the hoodlum gangsters and the authority. That's why the case will remain unresolved. They have been showing us a silly soap opera such as on TV. Play your role best and cheat us. JASON Jakarta I fully support the arrest of FPI members and hope it is the start for the government to be more firm in upholding law and order. HELMY Jakarta The government will not uphold justice, because there is no ""Government Defenders Front"". Who would defend them anyway? The people? I would not volunteer. EKO PUTRO Legian, Bali It is only one of many proofs of the government's failure as the protector of its people. The government stood by shaking their heads at the atrocity and yet the knee-deep corruption perseveres and the promises lie flat. What is the fate of Indonesia? Being handed from colonist to colonist even in the supposed age of democracy, maybe we should be begging to be under America's control because, war or no war, at least the Americans do not tolerate fanatical terrorists slaughtering peaceful demonstrators on a day commemorating freedom. STELLA Jakarta Indonesians, I have lived here nine years. I know you are a moderate, kind and extremely friendly people and feel sad to see such a small minority as the FPI creating a totally false impression of this wonderful country. CLIFF Jakarta The Indonesian government definitely has the power to contain and suppress violence, but there is simply no real commitment and action toward these cases. Moreover, the government promised us a lot of brilliant ideas in improving peace in this country, however, no real significant actions have been made to fulfill them until this present moment. ELIUS PRIBADI Jakarta Will the government uphold the justice? That would be the greatest gift to Indonesia and evidence the country is going the right direction.

Private matters of faith and belief are just that ... private! No matter whether right or wrong. Should we outlaw or punish those who believe the earth is flat? Or convince them otherwise through sound reason and logic? The state's only duty is to provide a safe and just environment in which to carry out this debate free from any coercion.

"Thu, June 12 2008",Genesis of non-state violence: FPI and a threatened democracy,"The assault against a peaceful rally on June 1 raises the question about the ease with which a group of protesters attacked another group, even when both protests were lawfully held near the centers of state authority at the National Monument (Monas), Jakarta. So, where was the state before it took action two days later? Had it been unwilling or unable to prevent the violence? Whether committed by a religious militia, a mafia or neo-feudal local leaders, non-state violence reflects the prevailing realities of state and society. Years ago, I discussed the phenomenon of mafia violence in early 20th century Sicily, Italy, with a good friend, the late historian Dr. Onghokham. The acts of violence committed by individual Mafioso were systemic despite the fact that they were dispersed and seemingly disconnected. Insightful as he was, Onghokham replied that this was very similar to early 19th century Java where the Dutch were neither capable of understanding nor controlling non-state violence. The Sicilian violence came to an end when the Italian fascists came to control the state. Similarly, Javanese rural violence receded as the Dutch imposed forced cultivation in the mid-19th century. Both indicate the significance of non-state violence and of networks of protection that were developed and sustained until they declined when state power expanded. Once the state started to collect taxes and attempted to guarantee security, the ""Mafiosi"" were threatened until the fascists terminated the endemic violence. In Java, Onghokham argued, since labor was scarce and land in abundance, poor peasants were tied to competing lords (Bupati) creating tensions and conflicts until the Dutch destroyed the system. This ended the networks of protection and competition, which had been responsible for much of the violence. In other words, the rise of the modern state with the legitimate monopoly of the use of force was decisive in suppressing non-state violence. One critical issue is the fact that nation-state democracies may still offer some partial protection for those involved in political violence -- a kind of ambiguous, real, expected or assumed protection based on mutual interests. Much as the absence of the state encouraged the ""Mafiosi"" to commit violence as they wished, so modern democracy can sometimes provide forms of state protection that mutatis mutandis may have similar effects. It's the raison d'etre of any modern state to guarantee the security of its citizens. However, it sometimes fails to carry out its mission. The controversy on the Ahmadiyah sect is a case in point. The sect has been allowed to live freely and actively for decades until signs of state intervention appeared on the horizon when the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) issued two fatwas (edicts) on Ahmadiyah in June 1980 and in July 2005. The anti-Ahmadiyah fatwas have since provided an on-going rationale which is providing a legitimizing platform for some religious leaders and some real and moral protection and cover for those who want to implement the fatwas in the name of religion. This has formalized the role of the MUI (founded in the late-1970s) as a state institution and made its fatwas appear more authoritative for all believers. This has opened up the exercise of state functions to the dominant religion: a flagrant violation of the principle of a secular state. Out of fear of alienating the angry masses, local authorities tend to remain passive when extremists take action. The peaceful rally on June 1 could only rely on self-help when they were attacked by a violent mob, since the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) claimed their actions were divinely justified and assumed that they were somehow protected by some authorities. The police were of little help since they were, to say the least, accustomed to not intervening too hastily when religious groups appeared on the scene. It's a public secret that the FPI was founded on Aug. 17, 1998 with the blessing and funds of some army and police generals, which brought about a real hope and expectation on the part of the militias involved that they were in any case obtaining protection. It's hard to explain otherwise. Asked why he chose to use violence instead of peaceful protest that might attract public sympathy, the FPI militia commander Munarman said on June 2: ""It's the Jews who attracted sympathy, but at the same time killing the Palestinians. This is our ijtihad (mission) and this (June 1 action) is the beginning of a long-term struggle."" But he was careful to use state legitimizing mantras, the rhetoric of FPI's patrons, when he accused the rally of threatening the state philosophy of Pancasila and the unitary state of Indonesia (NKRI). The Indonesian state has gone through phases of state violence (1965-66, East Timor, Aceh) and has also faced various horizontal conflicts, but the two have overlapped whenever short-term interests of powerful actors merged, as was probably the case in the May 1998 riots in Jakarta and during the unrest in Ambon (Maluku) and Poso (Central Sulawesi). Significantly, the FPI was founded precisely at this critical time in 1998-1999 when democratic reform opened new chances for the dominant religious groups while still convergent with the interests of the old elite. Its political genesis, therefore, included actions -- i.e. supporting the emergency law as proposed by the military, and the protest against retrospective investigation of Gen. Wiranto's role in East Timor in 1999 -- both of which clearly constituted collusion. Violence never occurs in a vacuum is the lesson one could learn from the sickening past of the Mafia and our own history. But networks of protection remain important and may turn into strategic linkages that could threaten our new democracy. Hence, the government's move against the FPI should include both political and legal steps to deal with its past violent crimes.

"Thu, June 12 2008",Indonesia remains 'tolerant country' despite FPI attack,"A prominent Catholic priest said Wednesday that the June 1 attack by Muslim hard-liners on a peaceful rally in Jakarta could lead to global misperceptions about Islam in Indonesia. ""The whole world gets the impression that this is Indonesian Islam. But this is nonsense,"" Franz Magnis-Suseno said during a discussion in Jakarta. He described these misperceptions as ""deep trouble"" for the Indonesian government. On June 1, members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), armed with bamboo sticks, beat and kicked activists of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion. Some 70 people were injured in the attack. Alliance members had earlier taken out ads in newspapers saying they endorsed pluralism, and urging people not to be intimidated by those who opposed religious freedom. ""We are fine. There is no problem in Indonesia. Even changing religion from Islam to another religion is possible. It is a very substantial thing,"" Franz told the discussion, hosted by the Center for Islam and State Studies at Paramadina University. He pointed out that 10 percent of the population was Christian. ""There are some difficulties, certainly, but they can be sorted out,"" said Franz, who is rector of the Driyarkara School of Philosophy. ""There is no general hatred against the minority. There are Indonesian people out in the open using the political opening after the fall of Soeharto, and ordinary people's suspicion of others has been growing,"" he said. He did acknowledge the June 1 attack indicated that danger was lurking. ""The government is paralyzed by a fear of being perceived as anti-Islam or pro-Islam,"" he said. He disagreed with the commonly held view that Indonesia is at a crossroad. He said Indonesia still adhered to plurality, tolerance and the state ideology Pancasila. Franz urged people actively to work toward making Indonesia's young democracy a success. ""I am optimistic but it is necessary to acknowledge the danger of passivism. You have to do something about it,"" he said. Ninuk Mardiana Pambudy, a journalist with Kompas daily, told the discussion the attack showed that Indonesia was a society unable to handle its own conflicts. The discussion was held to mark the centennial commemoration of Indonesia's national awakening, the 1,000th day anniversary of the death of respected Muslim scholar Nurcholish ""Cak Nur"" Madjid and the 10th anniversary of the political reform era. Nadya Madjid, the daughter of Cak Nur, used the discussion to announce the establishment of the Nurcholish Madjid Society. She recalled how her father once told her that Islam in Indonesia was very young compared to Islam in India. ""Islam in Indonesia is still undergoing puberty. It's still a teenager who is searching for its identity, not as a lifestyle as yet, but as fashion, music, literature and film, the way we do during puberty, but this is not an excuse for the attack,"" she said. Nadya said that in the early days of Indonesia, Islam was used as a weapon against the Dutch colonial government. ""Maybe these people in the FPI are still holding on to their Islamic identity, not Indonesian identity. They are first Muslims then Indonesian, which is dangerous for the sovereignty of the country,"" she said. ""Indonesian Muslims have to learn about Islamic life in other countries by going out of Indonesia,"" said Nadya, who lives in the United States.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/12/indonesia-remains-039tolerant-country039-despite-fpi-attack.html,,2008
"Fri, June 13 2008",Violence in the name of Islam is desecration and blasphemy,"Should the government ban the FPI (Islam Defenders Front) for its repeated violence against other citizens of this country? Or would a ban send hard-liners underground and make it difficult to monitor the development of militant fundamentalism? If the FPI were to be banned would the group not just transform itself and reemerge under another banner? There is a strong argument against banning the FPI but individuals who commit violence should be brought to account. The logic behind the idea that it would be better to arrest only those who instigate and carry out acts of violence is sound and valid. Arresting the instigators would mean that the leaders of the FPI, who have often been recorded by the press slandering and demonizing other groups and other leaders -- even to the point of calling for mass murder -- will be charged. They are the most responsible for the violence committed by their followers in the recent and more distant past. They should not only be charged for instigating murder and violent attacks against people and property, but also an additional charge of blasphemy against the noble religion of Islam through actions of brutality should be seriously pursued. Why is it important to charge the ""thugs in robes"" for insulting Islam? Usually the hard-liner and militant groups who abuse the name of Islam for their political interests are the same people who throw around accusations that others have blasphemed against Islam. Often these groups intimidate, threaten and attack those they perceive to have insulted Islam or the Prophet. Sometimes they commit acts of terror, such as that seen in the latest attack on the Danish embassy in Pakistan. It is time to turn the tables. Prosecuting bigots for blasphemy and insulting Islam will create an atmosphere where for once people in Indonesia, particularly those who tend to agree with hard-liners' militant politics, can pause for thought. It will enlighten the world that not all Muslims and not all interpretations of Islam promote or condone brutality. Prosecuting the leaders of the FPI for desecration will make the point that if, for example, a non-Muslim cartoonist's cartoon of the Prophet, influenced by the image of violence that global militant Islam has created, is considered insulting enough to be avenged by indiscriminate death, surely the act of murdering innocent people in the name of the religion he brought is a much greater insult to the name and legacy of the most noble of the Prophets. The beautiful, peaceful, forgiving, kind, gentle, loving, just and eloquent Muhammad lives in the minds and hearts of millions of peace-loving Muslims who try to follow his examples in their daily lives. These pious people are those who are hopefully the silent majority of Muslims. Characteristically they stay away from debates and disagreements, and because of their reluctance to be involved in political discourse their aspirations are now drowned by the vocal and violent minority. Unfortunately the violent minority have during the past decades systematically developed an image of Islam as a fascistic religion incompatible with modern values. The current political will of our government to act against groups that promote violence and lawlessness presents an opportunity to give a voice to the silent Muslim majority who condemn violence in the silence of their prayers and fasts. The recent ""Monas incident"" prompted many Islamic scholars to voice their opposition to the expression of Islam displayed by the FPI. In several cities in Java, members of the traditionalist Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) pressured the local FPI chapters in their cities to disband. Ironically, the leadership of the FPI, on the other hand, lodged a complaint with the police, accusing nearly 300 people, including several leaders of NU and also Muhammadiyah, of provoking the violence they committed. The two groups, considered Islamic scholars and spiritual leaders by their followers, have now openly confronted each other. This means that the battle for the soul of Islam that has been simmering beneath the surface for several years here has now been brought to the fore by events initiated by militant groups, particularly the FPI. Perhaps this means that it is now time to resolve this conflict by bringing argument and counterargument into a court of law where a judge can make a ruling on what are acceptable expressions of Islam, and what expressions, though in the name of Islam, are actually abusing, desecrating, and blaspheming the sanctity of the religion. The general public can decide for themselves whose actions, words and deeds are more worthy of being considered to be emulating the words and deeds of Seal of the Prophets ( pbuh ). Should the expression of the truth of Islam be dominated by militant groups who cannot and will not allow others the freedom of interpretation and expression? Or should the image of Islam be given back to the members of the gentle and pious majority who weep silent tears of sorrow as they watch their religion, their holy texts and their beloved Prophet repeatedly tarnished by violent actions claimed to be righteous? When the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States shocked the world, some commentators opined that the teachings of Islam had been hijacked. Bringing those who commit crimes in the name of Islam to a civilized debate in a court of law, against the Islamic leaders whom they have slandered and accused of terrible crimes, would open the door of opportunity for the true spiritual leaders of Islam to subdue those who have hijacked their religion. People such as Abdurrahman ""Gus Dur"" Wahid, Syafii Ma'arif and Amien Rais, who have been accused by the FPI leadership of instigating the recent violence in Monas on the commemoration of the birth of Pancasila, are no strangers to Islamic thought. They should be given a public forum from which they can expose the intellectual poverty and the spiritual depravity of violent Islam. Twisting the teachings of a noble and peaceful religion to promote violence should be seen for what it essentially is: desecration and blasphemy. The writer is an artist and former journalist.

"Sat, June 14 2008",Clash between fundamentalism and modernism,""" Awas, ada orang Islam! "" (Watch out, Muslims are coming!) is now a joke among activists after the brutal attack by members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) on participants of a peaceful rally organized by the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB). Some probably view the joke as blasphemy against the religion of the Prophet Muhammad but others might see a lesson behind it. Traditional ulemas would quickly deny that Islam teaches violence, but progressive scholars directly condemn the attack and would admit the brutality has its roots in the religion's teachings. It's probably not exaggerating to say that Sunday's rallies around the National Monument (Monas) in Central Jakarta were representative of a continuing battle between fundamentalists and supporters of civil society. The FPI claimed their attack was provoked by newspaper advertisements by the AKKBB which, among other things, supported Ahmadiyah, a sect considered heretical by the Indonesian Ulema Council. A national conservative newspaper (thank God, it's only one) even wrote, ""Ahmadiyah is the problem"", and blamed the government for not banning the religious sect. The FPI, who joined another rally organizing a sharia-supporting group and protesting the fuel prices hike in front of the Presidential Palace, decided that beating infidels who commemorate the secular state ideology of Pancasila was more important. In a soccer game, the FPI is probably similar to Zinedine Zidane, the French player who headbutted Italian defender Marco Materazzi for verbally offending him in the 2006 World Cup. Religious violence is actually not new in Indonesia despite the claim that Islam arrived here in peace, brought by Indian Gujarat traders and propagated by preachers known as Wali Songo. A newly reprinted book with the subtitle, Teror Agama Islam Mazhab Hambali Di Tanah Batak (Islam's Hambali School of Terror in Batak Land), by Mangaradja Onggang Parlindungan, described how puritans forced their beliefs and killed the locals in the 1800s. Fundamentalism here has its roots in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, says Muslim scholar Azyumardi Azra in his book, The Origins of Islamic Reformism in Southeast Asia . The current radical organizations are also led by ulemas (they called themselves habib ) who have relations -- cultural and probably financial -- to the Middle East. It's true the FPI is small -- and maybe frightful -- but some may view the fundamentalist group is part of a larger group, including political parties which are still hiding their eternal dream to change the country into an Islamic state. Supporters of the AKKBB, many of them Muslims, view these groups as a threat to a pluralistic Indonesia, the idea of which has begun to dim in the hearts of its citizens, including its leaders. Similar reasons could be used to understand why the police are also afraid to take actions against radicals who recently destroyed mosques and properties of Ahmadiyah members. But certain officials might still think radical groups can be used to lessen their burden to maintain security. We still remember the civilian militia groups ( pamswakarsa ) that were actually established to fight pro-reform activists in 1998. A military commander and a police chief reportedly helped establish the groups. Like Soeharto who tried to attract Muslims due to the weakening support from the military near the end of his power, certain elements in the government might seek support from the FPI and other fundamentalist groups to maintain their power even while sacrificing the country's unity. These power-greedy opportunists do not care about any ideology as long as they can be elected in the general elections next year. They visited and showed sympathy to a radical leader, whose followers tortured AKKBB activists at the rally. But with the support of diverse elements of civil society, including mass media, the incident could be used to strengthen our commitment to democracy, a political system which does not tolerate violence. Let's make the Monas tragedy a stepping stone toward a more democratic country that protects diversity in term of cultures, and faiths, including differences within a religion. If we fail to learn from the tragedy, we will witness more violence which could lead to the breakup of the country. We would see uniformity, instead of diversity. If we ignored the incident, we will watch more and more goateed people in Pakistani attire carry sticks and beat others who considered heretical. And the joke, Awas, ada orang Islam , is no longer a joke. The joke teller would probably be considered defaming his religion. The writer is a journalist at The Jakarta Post .

"Sat, June 14 2008",Victims fear FPI attack might be eclipsed by Ahmadiyah issue,"STOP SIGN: Members of the South Sulawesi Muslim Community Alliance rally outside the Jamaah Ahmadiyah office in Makassar on Friday. The protesters demanded the Ahmadiyah followers stop their activities and pull down their signboard. ( JP/Andi Hajramurni ) Victims of the June 1 National Monument (Monas) attack have said demands for the Ahmadiyah sect to be banned are part of a systematic attempt to deflect public attention away from the violence that took place. Nino Graciano, a rights activist who was assaulted by members of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) during the ambush, said the move against Ahmadiyah would only serve to conceal the real issue. ""People will forget the brutal violence and accept the motives behind the attack,"" Nino said. He was among five members of the National Integration Movement (NIM) and students of several universities in Denpasar who were beaten by FPI members while participating in a peaceful rally to support freedom of religion. Another victim, Nyoman Aisanya Wibhuti, or Oming, said the attackers targeted not only Ahmadiyah followers taking part in the rally, but also other demonstrators. ""I told them (the attackers) I am a Hindu, but they kept beating me,"" Oming recalled. She sustained a head injury, which she said might cause permanent brain damage. Nino said he was afraid the mounting calls for Ahmadiyah to be banned could lead to the facts about the attack being buried and provide reasons to free the attackers. ""The government should be firm in dealing with the attack by saying what happened was a sudden assault on people who were holding a peaceful rally. Therefore, transparent investigation is needed and maximum punishments must be given to the attackers,"" he said. The police have arrested nine people in connection to the Monas violence. NIM president Maya Safira Muchtar said the NGO activists had received threats in the forms of phone calls and text messages before and after the attack, but she said the group would not bow to the intimidation. ""We do not intend to spread hatred against the FPI or other hard-line groups, but our message is that we need real actions to preserve national unity,"" she said. Since the joint decree restricting the activities of Ahmadiyah followers was issued, many have demanded the Islamic sect, which the government deems to be ""deviant"", be banned.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/14/victims-fear-fpi-attack-might-be-eclipsed-ahmadiyah-issue.html,,2008

Matsuni, 40, was visiting his cousin, Mahyudi, at the Pondok Griya housing complex in Cirebon, West Java, on Friday morning when police arrived at the site and arrested him. ""He was at the scene when the attack happened. We are still questioning him,"" said Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Ketut Untung Yoga Ana on Friday. Cirebon Police have intensified security on the borders of West Java and Central Java. ""We have intensified our search for the suspects,"" Cirebon Police chief Sr. Comr. Nasser Amir said. ""I have instructed all police officers under my supervision to keep searching around the clock."" Ketut said Matsuni was one of 20 suspects identified by police involved in attacks on dozens of activists from the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB). They went to Monas to commemorate the state ideology of Pancasila and show their support to the Ahmadiyah sect, whose beliefs have sparked recent controversy. The attack left at least 70 people injured. Eight other suspects, including the leader of the Islam Troop Command, Munarman, are officially under police custody, leaving the remaining 11 at large. The police also detained FPI leader Rizieq Shihab two days after the attack, accusing him of provocation and protecting criminals. Over 100 members of the Peace Alliance Against Blasphemy of Islam, including members of the United Development Party, swarmed city police headquarters Friday, demanding the police suspend Rizieq's arrest. ""Rizeq is not a criminal. We guarantee he will not run away and the police can detain us if he does,"" leader of the alliance Noer Muhammad Iskandar told Ketut. Ketut said the police would take their comments merely as support because arrest suspensions could only be requested by the detainee, his family or lawyer. Alliance members read their request to the police, concerning police treatment of AKKBB activists and FPI members, as well as the alliance's hope to disband Ahmadiyah. Noer threatened to commit further attacks if the government did not disband Amadiyah in the next month, saying the ministerial joint decree was not enough. After the meeting, the police allowed the representatives to visit Rizieq, even though it was outside visiting hours.

The long-forgotten souls forcefully displaced for the construction of the Kedung Ombo dam toward and electrical installations the end of the 1980s are now being joined by the hundreds of Sidoarjo families driven from their homes by the flood of mud triggered by faulty oil and gas drilling procedures. And, most recently, the news of the deaths of 21 small children in Indonesia's eastern regions, while Indonesia's infant and maternal mortality rate remain higher than those of its Southeast Asian neighbors, echoes the situation faced by Indonesia's poor in the years immediately following independence and through to the late 1970s. While the current House of Representatives remains full of bickering politicians more concerned about jockeying for party advancement and cushy commission seats than about what is happening along the narrow alleys of the country's urban centers or the muddy paths of its most distant islands, and radical groups like FPI and JI continue to find enough leeway to suppress and terrorize those who do not follow their prescription for running the country. Not too much unlike the political situation existing from the 1950s through to the early 1960s, and leading up to the bloody disaster of the September 1965 coup. Only the faces and names have changed; the behavior reflects things long hidden from view; secrets long kept; stories long untold. In this context, the Semsar Siahaan exhibition at Cemara 6 Gallery, which ends today, and the exhibition of a group of rarely heard from artists scheduled to open at the National Gallery on Thursday, June 19, seem to take on a greater significance than any other art displays held in recent months. The holding and the content of both exhibitions speak clearly of not only of Indonesia's art history, but of its political polarization, social turmoil and struggle to find a solid footing in an ever-shifting global landscape. The ""Liberation Art"" of Semsar Siahaan, who worked intensely as both artist and human rights activists for two-and-a half decades before his death in 2005, has it roots in the social realism of artists like Djoko Pekik and Amrus Natalsya, whose works will be shown along with those of a number of artists who focus on social and political themes that are particularly relevant in the face of current events in the country. Perhaps the most interesting element of the coming Sanggar Bambu 2 exhibition, outside of the messages about the rights of human beings to enough to eat, to shelter, to access to education and a way to earn a living, as well as to freedom of speech, is the fact that the artists showing have lived through huge chunks of Indonesian art history, with some even being both players and pawns in the chess game of Indonesian politics and social upheaval. Amrus Natalsya, who primarily sculpts and carves reliefs from wood, and Djoko Pekik, who paints, in particular, have ample reason to relish the current atmosphere achieved through the long struggle for freedom of expression and human rights carried on by fellow artists for three decades and culminating in the Reformation Movement, which, since 1998, has set into place the democratic system and institutions that allow them the opportunity to show their works freely without censure or constraints. Djoko Pekik and Amrus Natalsya are among the many artists of the 1960s, who, because of their political affiliations (some worked under the auspices of the Indonesian Communist Party's cultural arm known as LEKRA) and stances on social issues, were harassed, imprisoned, exiled or even killed. From the mid 1960s through to 1998, when the exit from power of Soeharto (Indonesia's second president) neither Djoko nor Amrus could find a gallery or art space willing to display their works. Not that nobody cared, they simple did not dare show any sign of ""fraternizing with the enemy"" in the wake of the mass killings of leftists and others of ""suspects"" political leanings of late 1965 and through 1966, and the continuing detention and disappearances of the following three decades. Now, 10 years since the Reform Movement began the difficult task of trying to set right so many wrongs, Amrus Natalsya, Djoko Pekik and other artists, whose struggle to express themselves creatively has been exceedingly long and difficult, will be showing their works publicly in an exhibition sanctioned and facilitated by a state institution. So, just as one might be getting the feeling that history has gotten stuck in another cyclical mode, perhaps the very fact that two such powerful and important exhibitions are being held one after the other in both a private and a public venue, might serve to remind us of how much really has changed, and how vital it is for reformation to continue.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/15/exhibits-take-human-rights-struggle.html,,2008
"Mon, June 16 2008",Letter: On 'FPI too busy talking about God',"This letter is to respond to a 'By The Way' column titled ""FPI too busy talking about God"" by T. Sima Gunawan published on page one of The Sunday Jakarta Post on June 8. She starts her article with a joke: ""Christians are so close to God that they call him ""father"" in prayer, while Muslims are so far away from Allah that they need loudspeakers to talk to him"". It was stated that she couldn't tell it earlier because she was afraid. Moreover, if Rizieq Shihab had found out, she said he might have beaten her black and blue or, worse, burned down her house. Knowing he is now in a custody, it seemed like she felt free to tell the joke. She wrote her apology at the end of her article, saying that she didn't mean to upset anyone by it. If she didn't mean it, what she mean by joking like that? Is it a wise joke to tell, contrasting religious practices in public -- where the reader could be a Muslim, a Christian, or something else? It doesn't help things become better. In another part of her article, she wrote about the FPI attack of Playboy in 2006, commenting: ""But perhaps the real reason was that they were disappointed to find the Indonesian version didn't have the same ""hot"" pictures as its American parent"". Again, is it a wise thing to say? I, as a Muslim -- even though I am not a member of FPI -- feel insulted by these words. There were also many things she explained were irrelevant to the main problem, such as Muslims call to prayer, Friday prayer, FPI's activities at Ramadhan, and the joke about SBY at ""Ayat-Ayat Cinta"" (Verses of Love). She said FPI was too busy talking to God. I am not going to defend FPI, but I will try to put this problem in its context. I agree that talking to God is important but it isn't enough. We must balance our interaction, both with God and human beings. Judging others without knowing the real situation doesn't make the situation better. What we need now is an understanding of each other as Indonesians with all our diversity.

"Mon, June 16 2008",Ahmadiyah ruling a test for civil society,"The government's decision to issue a joint ministerial decree ordering the Ahmadiyah sect to cease all activities will not stop the public from discussing the controversy. The nation is indeed experiencing a difficult period of how to maintain its unity. The June 1 attack on members of the National Alliance for Freedom of Faith and Religion has drawn mixed reactions from the public. The incident is actually a test for the blossoming civil society 10 years after the reform movement began in Indonesia. This phenomenon is quite disappointing. On one side, we are disappointed with the emergence of a social group using violence, rather than dialogue, in the name of a certain religion and gaining no timely response from law enforcers. Even worse, the police reportedly have used them for moonlighting. On the other side, we are very disappointed with an overreaction from certain parties and figures whom we have paid respect to as reform agents and part of the development of a true democracy in the country. They urged disbanding, not using the courts. The disappointment with the latter group is that civil society in the country is still far from mature. This group is no less emotional and explosive than the previous. The idea of disbanding a civilian organization emerges from an immature attitude and goes against the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution. Facing such a case, the government has been blamed. It has for years showed its weaknesses and failure in running the administration and managing the state. What happened at the National Monument (Monas) three weeks ago was actually a time bomb that began ticking when President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Vice President Jusuf Kalla took office in November 2004. The absence of an appropriate policy and decision is found not only in the social field but also in political, economic, environmental and natural resource exploration matters. In the cultural field, the government fails to perceive the meaning of a complicated transition. The long transitionary path to a true democracy is looking idle, reaching its peak in the people's desperation. As a nation, Indonesia is losing a direction and falling into desperation. And it is quite astonishing and tragic that scuffles and sectarian conflicts among religions, ethnic groups and interest groups are still a common phenomenon eight years into the millennium age. If we are determined and make a determination that the democratic culture is impossible without dialogue and fair law enforcement, the democracy undoubtedly will go on effectively to gradually bring us toward a strong civil society. But in reality the government blends the meaning of ""to be democratic"" with ""to be ineffective"". We really do not understand how a presidential spokesman, when asked about scuffles between the students and the police, has repeatedly and proudly said that, to the President, ""it is all ' bunga-bunga democracy' (minor incidents beautifying the democracy)."" So, to the government, the chaotic situation and the ineffective law enforcement are really an acceptable side effect. This kind of thinking is very naive. From the beginning, the government should have born in mind that the long transitionary period needed a dialogue and undiscriminatory law enforcement. A dialogue among all social elements should be facilitated along the drastic shifting from the authoritarian regime to an era of liberty. All social elements should know each other in honesty and frankness. So far, conflicts have frequently emerged because of the absence of good communication; and during the dictatorship, the prejudice among religions, ethnicities, social classes and between East and West and Java and non-Java were maintained to preserve the status quo. This condition should be repaired by facilitating a productive diametric dialogue among all parties. The government should have formulated, in the very beginning, a fundamental policy to support and implement their political jargon, bersama kita (together we are able), that functions as a preventive action and settlement mechanism to establishing unity amid a chaotic situation. A dialogue is just a beginning of social communications which have been negated by the development trilogy, which stipulates security is everything. A social dialogue to maintain security has also been prohibited and all social elements were fragmented and formed their own in-groups and perceived others as out-groups and enemy, despite the fact that all elements are brothers. When the state fails to deliver, the people cast their hope on the civilian strength to manage the state and develop a true democracy. But when they were entrusted as public officials to manage the state, one part remained corrupt and another part was proud of themselves despite no performance. The civilian elite group was found unprepared to be statesmen, unable to put the public interests above their personal and group interests. To salvage the reform movement, a ""cell group"" is needed to work wisely, maturely, intelligently and communicatively to remind all elements that the transition requires honesty and a peaceful path. All the use of intimidation, terror and violence must be halted and prosecuted according to law. And groups should not use the state to disband the FPI. A disbandment of a social organization is a bad precedent of killing civilian liberty. And the law must be enforced to determine whether the social organization has gone beyond the Constitution and the law. The FPI should be disbanded only after the government has adequate evidence that its executives has an open or hidden agenda endangering the peace and the common future. Disbanding the FPI will make the problem more complicated and encourage its supporters to take vengeance and raise prejudice among the people. We as members of a big family known as Indonesia should discuss all the problems and seek a peaceful solution. If the FPI goes against the Constitution it is our common obligation to remind it of its violations. Allowing the state to interfere in the religions' internal affairs is a start of a disaster. Instead of issuing a joint decree to disband the Ahmadiyah sect, the government should have facilitated a social dialogue among Muslims to seek a solution to the issue. A honest and open dialogue among Muslim leaders would certainly be able to settle any disputes and prevent the use of violence no matter how serious the problem is.

"Tue, June 17 2008",Forum: Indonesian Boxing,"Recently, I stayed up late to watch a live boxing match on TV. The match was between an Indonesian and a Filipino. While it was a non-title bout, it lasted the whole 10 rounds and one does not need to be a boxing expert to know the match was so close it could have gone either way. No clear-cut winner! In fact, I was expecting the worst, because the Filipino boxer was so classy and lively he made the Indonesian boxer look like a joke. To my surprise, when the scores were read, it was a unanimous decision in favor of the Indonesian boxer. Wow! How did that happen? This exemplifies the state of Indonesian boxing as a whole. How can we compete at more prestigious boxing levels and events when even on a late night boxing circus, we cheat our way to victory? BADRI W.

"Tue, June 17 2008","Police hunt man with gun, 11 others over AKKBB attack","Police are still trying to track down an unidentified man seen holding a gun at a religious rally earlier this month, along with 11 other persons wanted in relation to violence at the rally. The originally peaceful rally, held by the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) at the National Monument park in Central Jakarta, turned violent when AKKBB members were ambushed by members of other groups. ""We are still hunting a man seen holding a gun during the rally on June 1, whose image was captured by television cameras, and 11 wanted persons,"" National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Abubakar Nataprawira said Monday. The police have so far charged 10 suspects, including Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab and Islam Troop Command leader Munarman, along with eight Islam Troop Command members who are on the list of the 20 wanted persons. Abubakar refuted the suggestion the armed man was a member of the secret police. ""The police did not deploy any secret agents or armed personnel to join the rally. So it will be the duty of the Jakarta Police to determine the identity of that person."" Abubakar said the police had called AKKBB members to testify on the chronology of the incident. ""Today (Monday), the Jakarta Police summoned three members of the AKKBB, who were in charge during the rally,"" he said. Uli Parulian Sihombing, a lawyer for the AKKBB, said Ahmad Suaedy had answered the police summons to testify as a victim. ""Ahmad Suaedy was one of the AKKBB activists who was injured during the rally. He was wounded in his chin by a sharpened bamboo stick wielded by an FPI member. He came to the police headquarters to give his statement on the tragedy and identify the perpetrator,"" he said. Munarman's lawyer, Syamsul Bahri Radjam, said the police should name the armed man as a suspect and forbid him from traveling overseas. ""The police have to treat him the same as they treated Munarman,"" he told reporters during the questioning of the Islam Troop Command leader. ""The holder of the gun could be charged with violating the State Emergency Law."" AKKBB lawyer Uli Parulian Sihombing told The Jakarta Post the person was unlikely to be a member of the AKKBB. ""It was a peaceful event. So we had set clear rules before the event that no kind of violence was allowed. We believe the person with the gun was not a participant in the rally,"" he said. Rizieq has submitted a pretrial request challenging the Jakarta Police case against him, as reported by kompas.com . He is arguing the police did not follow correct procedures during his arrest. The pretrial request was filed with the Central Jakarta District Court. (nkn/ind)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/17/police-hunt-man-with-gun-11-others-over-akkbb-attack.html,,2008
"Wed, June 18 2008",Forum: Restricting foreign ads,"Just a quick comment on the above story: It would a serious mistake to ban foreign ads from Indonesian television and radio. This would distance yourself from foreign investment, tourists and all other forms of revenue outside of Indonesia. To companies from outside Indonesia, it is an uneducated stance that would plunge your economy and cause higher inflationary pressure than current levels. Maybe, if the ban could be on certain programs such as news and current affairs, this may dampen the effect it has on foreign investments. ROD Sydney Busway not so safe and comfortable -- June 9, p. 5 Safety is the most important issue for the whole country. Introducing a 'safety watch dog' is a must, as this will avoid compo money, not just in Indonesia but around the world. Australia has established the 'Work Safety' body (which is working well) to control and prevent accidents, which are caused by many manufacturers and service providers including public transport. If there are shortcuts in construction, than someone needs to answer to this. In China, there was recently a tragedy where building collapsed after quake because builders were using low grade materials. Such responsible people should be shot. The world doesn't need accident victims arriving from builders and their negligence or corrupted officials. B. B. LEO Jakarta Anti-Ahmadiyah decree -- June 16, p. 0 I agree with the opinion of the chairman of the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM), that the decree has curbed freedom of religion in Indonesian society. I have two reasons. First, Indonesia admits and respects several religions and other beliefs under the five principles of Pancasila, so that the government should give people freedom of religion and belief. Second, freedom in Islam is one of the most sacred rights, which means Islam places freedom of opinion, belief and expression compatible with Islam's sharia law. It means that Islam is tolerant to non-Muslims as God's creatures and gives freedom for learning and choosing their beliefs. But on the contrary, I do not agree with his opinion that the Indonesian government should not follow the example of Pakistan. Why? First, Although Indonesia is not an Islamic country, the majority of Indonesians are Muslim, who have great influence on the country's laws. Therefore, I agree that Indonesia take the example of Pakistan in declaring Ahmadiyah not an Islamic organization. Second, the government should declare that Ahmadiyah is not an Islamic organization because we all know that they are not Muslims and there is no guarantee that they will not propagate their religious teachings. KETTI Jakarta Ahmadiyah ruling a test for civil society -- June 16, p. 6 Reading this article, it is not hard to conclude: Let the FPI exist and don't disband it, because it contradicts the idea of civil society and democracy.

"Wed, June 18 2008",View Point: In the land of the dead kangaroo,"I had a shock on my early morning walk a few days ago. As I rounded a corner, I saw a huge kangaroo lying dead in the road ahead of me. My God, I thought, how could there be a dead kangaroo in a suburban Jakarta housing complex? Quite apart from the fact that kangaroos are not native to Indonesia (so what was it doing here anyway?), the massive animal would soon start to rot, flies and maggots would come, pestilence and disease would spread, And the stench! Ugh! It would be unimaginably horrible and disgusting! With heart pounding, I approached the carcass to examine it, and, low and behold, the ""dead kangaroo"" turned out to be, ahem, a big stone, a sack of dirt, an old tire and bamboo sticks (the spindly legs of the ""kangaroo""!) that someone had put in the street to cover a big hole. From a distance, the contours of this arrangement of objects somehow resembled a dead kangaroo. Silly me. My eyes and my overactive writer's imagination were playing tricks on me. And then I thought, perhaps the minds of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and other Muslim hard-liners work in much the same way. No, they don't see dead marsupials lurking in our streets (so far as I know!), but they do imagine other harmless things to be equally repulsive and threatening -- like the tiny Islamic sect, Jamaah Ahmadiyah, which they denounce as deviant. The difference is that the FPI's delusions are way more dangerous than my optical illusions. They are calling for Indonesian Ahmadis to be killed and have led violent attacks on the sect and those who call for it to be tolerated, thus polarizing Indonesian Islam. There are now three broad trends in Muslim attitudes toward the Ahmadis. The first trend includes the extreme right, who demand a violent purging of what they consider to be the source of a horrible ""disease"" -- their ""dead kangaroo"". If the state won't act, then they will launch a private, armed jihad. As we all should know, settling differences with hatred and violence is simply not on; it's wrong, according to both democracy and Islam (which says clearly that you should respect differences ""as a sign of the bounty of God""). The second trend covers conservatives who agree with the hard-liners that Ahmadiyah must be purged. This group also wants the state to ban the sect, but it condemns physical violence. The danger is that although this group eschews violence, it ends up implicitly condoning and supporting the hard-liners. The third trend covers mainstream ""secular Muslims"". They also see Ahmadiyah as theologically mistaken in believing that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1839-1908), and not Muhammad, was the last prophet of Islam, but are basically tolerant, believing that ""deviants"" -- even atheists -- are entitled to their (non-) beliefs. They also believe that the state should not interfere in matters of faith, let alone ban groups with different religious interpretations. Like most Indonesian Muslims, the National Alliance for Cultural and Religious Diversity (AKKBB), of which I'm a member, the group that was attacked by hard-liners at the National Monument (Monas), on June 1, would probably fall into this third trend. Historically, there have always been tensions between religious and secular groups in Indonesia, especially since the obligation to follow Islamic law included in the first draft of the 1945 Constitution (the so-called ""Jakarta Charter"") was deleted that same year. During Soeharto's New Order regime, the military (and the state) dominated and repressed political Islam. In the current reformasi era, however, Muslim hard-liners are allowed political space to be their authoritarian selves -- ironic, given that Indonesia is trying to democratize. Well, that's the risk of being a rights-based pluralistic democracy: you guarantee that the enemies of rights and pluralism have the right to be heard. Unfortunately, they forget that the same rights are also guaranteed to others. More unfortunate still, the government seems to have forgotten that it is the one that does the guaranteeing! It should step in decisively and stress that we are now a plural society, but Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's administration is paralyzed in the face of FPI and the ""dark side"" of civil society. Ahmadiyah is the scapegoat targeted by the hard-liners today, but if the government fails to be firm now, other minorities will be next. And if the government thinks that containing the current tensions is difficult, wait until it has to contain a civil war, which could happen if Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) decides to release its Ansor youth against the FPI. When mass organizations in Indonesia mobilize their paramilitary youth wings, long-established historical patterns tell us real trouble is on the way! If the government keeps turning a blind eye to hard-line violence, then it might not be a government for long. Politicians may fear having the Islam card played against them, but they forget that there's also a democracy card now. Hard-liners only ever represent a minority of voters and their explicit aim is to end secular government, so why is Yudhoyono pandering to them by issuing the joint ministerial decree curtailing Ahmadiyah activities? ""Something is rotten in the state of Denmark,"" as Marcellus says in Hamlet , and there is something rotten in Indonesia too. And it's not my illusory ""dead kangaroo"", not the nutty but harmless Ahmadis, but instead -- surprise, surprise -- FPI and their ilk, bashing, abusing and calling for murder with seeming impunity. It's time we all stopped calling them ""Islamic"". It's time our government came out and denounced them for what they are: murderous, intolerant thugs. I am not a devout Muslim, but the reprehensible way the FPI behaves offends me as a Muslim, and I am sure it offends many other ""secular Muslims"". And we are the majority, which should count for a lot in a democracy that has elections next year. The writer is the author of Sex, Power and Nation .

"Wed, June 18 2008",Respecting prophets and holy men,"In the prayer house close to home that I usually visit, the prayer leader almost never forgets to offer a special prayer for Syaikh Abdul Qadir Al Jailani, a noted ulema from Baghdad. Offering a joint prayer, a practice common among members of the Nahdlatul Ulama, is a form of respect to him as he had a high level of piety. Generally, the congregation will do this after they complete their ritual prayer and also after first offering a prayer for Prophet Muhammad. In several places, Muslims honor the book Manakib , which dwells on the spiritual journey of Jailani, and the book Barzanji , which contains the history of Prophet Muhammad. Some other Muslims, however, do not agree with the idea of showing excessive respect, let alone even placing the Koran and Prophet Muhammad in second position. In other groups, such as the tarekat (spiritual fraternity), to pray for their leaders, or mursyid (teachers), has become a must as they are believed to serve as the mediator for every prayer made. Among the Shiite group, Ali bin Abi Thalib, one of the friends and sons-in-law of Prophet Muhammad, and his descendants, enjoys a special position. In principle, honoring someone considered ""holy"" does not conflict with Islamic teachings. The Koran teaches Muslims to respect previous prophets, ulema and umara (rulers). The practice of respecting senior ulema is indeed common in Indonesia, as can be seen from the fact that the tombs of the Wali Songo (the nine earliest Islamic propagators), including the tomb of Sunan Gunung Jati in Cirebon, are always crowded with pilgrims. In fact, all have a common goal, namely the hope of following the right way to reach God, whom they idolize, just as their ulema have done. Similarly, the Ahmadiyah group, in their own way, pay great respect to their leader, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, and his book, Tadzkirah . Unfortunately, the Ahmadiyah group has called Mirza a prophet, showing that they believe that there is a prophet after Prophet Muhammad. This practice has divided Ahmadiyah into two groups, the Ahmadiyah Qadian, who believe that Mirza is a prophet, and the Ahmadiyah Lahore, who, like other non-Ahmadiyah groups, acknowledge Mirza only as a reformer of Islam and believe that Prophet Muhammad is khataman nabiyin (the closing prophet). This difference in interpretation has become sharpened and is found not only in Indonesia. Eventually, some non-Ahmadiyah groups concluded that Ahmadiyah has left Islam ( murtad ). Of course, this opinion is rejected by Ahmadiyah, because they perform the same religious service as Prophet Muhammad taught. Indeed, not all non-Ahmadiyah groups can understand and show tolerance toward the teachings of Ahmadiyah, with their different concept of prophet. Those who do not understand these teachings consider Ahmadiyah as having disturbed their faith. Meanwhile, those who understand Ahmadiyah teachings consider this just a difference in interpretation that must be respected. However, the outbreak of violence among Muslims reflects the loss of the spirit of ukhuwah Islamiyah (Muslim brotherhood) in Indonesia, as Muslims fail to prioritize dialogue, which should be carried out with patience, mutual respect and rationality. The issuance of a joint decree by the minister of religious affairs, the attorney general and the home minister regarding Ahmadiyah, which bans the propagation of teachings that deviate from the principles of Islam, namely acknowledging a prophet after Prophet Muhammad, may be construed as the failure of Muslims to solve their problems internally. Therefore, in the context of respecting every party, the issuance of this joint decree should be considered as a middle course the government has taken to maintain national integrity and bring to a meeting point the differences among fellow citizens. As a legal product, the joint decree has its shortcomings, such as the fact that its content lacks firmness and conflicts with the principles of personal freedom and human rights. There are worries that this prohibition will be a bad precedent when the majority group can no longer respect minority groups owing to differences in religious interpretation. Many people even suspect that the issuance of this joint decree was caused by considerable pressure on the government, particularly from conservative and radical Muslim groups that do not understand the concept of pluralism. One thing should not be forgotten, however, the problem of Ahmadiyah is a sensitive on involving religious, social and political aspects. A serious problem that must be corrected among Ahmadiyah is that they must mix with non-Ahmadiyah in their religious services. Until now they have preferred to perform their religious services only in mosques belonging to their own group. For groups opposing Ahmadiyah, including the FPI, it is time for them to learn to respect Ahmadiyah. It is not wise to consider the issuance of the joint decree as a form of victory. On the other hand, the FPI must transform itself into a peaceful organization if it does not wish to be labeled a group of hooligans in long white robes, or to borrow from the latest edition of Tempo magazine, "" beriman tanpa jadi preman "" (faith without turning into hooligans), because the violence committed by the FPI does not reflect a belief in God. The government must also be fair and firm, particularly in regard to the presence of the FPI, which has committed numerous acts of violence.

"Thu, June 19 2008",Moderate groups under fire for silence over radicals,"Moderate Muslim organizations and political parties have come under fire for failing to demonstrate their religious tolerance following a government decree against an Islamic minority sect. As major moderate groups, the nation's two largest Muslim organizations Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah should have prevented the issuance of a joint ministerial decree against Jamaah Ahmadiyah, say Muslim scholars and political observers. They told The Jakarta Post the decree showed the NU and Muhammadiyah were powerless to counter extremist and conservative elements in their campaigns for Islamism. The anti-Ahmadiyah decree was issued by the government earlier this month amid intense pressure from many extremist groups, including the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia. The government-sanctioned Indonesia Ulema Council (MUI) landed support for the decree. ""The NU and Muhammadiyah have so far been just too soft and too tolerant against small militant groups,"" political expert Indra J. Pilliang of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies said. He said the two organizations had given too much space for hard-line groups to take the public stage claiming to represent Indonesian Muslims. Indra warned that a ""culture of violence"" against minority groups would rise more quickly thanks to the inaction of the NU, Muhammadiyah and moderate political parties to foster religious tolerance and pluralism in the country. The issuance of the anti-Ahmadiyah decree and a recent attack by FPI members on pro-pluralism activists from the National Alliance for the Freedom of Religion and Faith (AKKBB), who were staging a rally for religious tolerance, were clear examples of the dysfunctionality of the two moderate Islamic groups and political parties, he added. ""They have to get tough against extremist groups and strongly condemn any attacks to avoid widespread violence that can turn into mass fascism,"" Indra said. Muslim scholar and Paramadina University rector Anies Baswedan said the NU and Muhammadiyah had failed to control the MUI with their pluralism mission. The MUI is led by clerics from the NU and Muhammadiyah but the council has often issued extremist fatwa , banning pluralism, liberalism and secularism as well as branding Ahmadiyah a heretical sect. ""What happens is the MUI doesn't represent the voice of Muslims as a whole,"" he said. Anies said the NU and Muhammadiyah should take the lead in preventing several Muslim individuals or groups from taking violent actions in the name of Islam. Rafendi Jamin of the Human Rights Working Group blamed the political parties for only caring about their short-term political interests and neglecting their mission for the betterment of the country, including promoting religious pluralism and tolerance. All the parties should work together to fix Indonesia's international image by not tolerating violence and respecting human rights, he said. Indra said the country's political parties were trying to woo more voters ahead of the 2009 elections by giving support for the anti-Ahmadiyah decree or taking side with the majority Muslim groups. Such a stance was more popular than acting otherwise, he added. Anies warned the religious violence could increase due to the government's failure to provide jobs for people.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/19/moderate-groups-under-fire-silence-over-radicals.html,,2008

The protesters, who were members of the FPI, the Islam Community Forum (FUI), Muslim organizations and Islamic boarding schools in the city and surrounding areas also demanded President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono ban minority Islamic sect Ahmadiyah and asked police to arrest a man who was holding a gun during the National Monument attack, which happened three weeks ago. City police spokesman Sr. Comr. Ketut Untung Yoga Ana told 17 leaders of the protest the police had named the unidentified man a fugitive and were looking for him. ""Residents can bring him to the police or give us information about his whereabouts if they happen to find him,"" he said. He warned protesters not to hurt him should they find him. The FPI earlier reported to police the man they accused of being a provocateur from the National Alliance of Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) and submitted his photograph to them. Although the protest leaders looked satisfied after hearing of the gunman, they still demanded the police release Rizieq, FPI members and Munarman. They also insisted on meeting the Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Adang Firman. They were upset when the chief refused to meet them. ""The police did not treat us Muslims fairly. They did not arrest the members of AKKBB like they arrested the FPI members and their leader,"" M. Al Khaththa, general secretary of FUI said to Ketut.

"Fri, June 20 2008",FPI attacks damage RI Muslims' image: Muhammadiyah chairman,"Violence by members of a radical Islamic group earlier this month has damaged the international image of Indonesian Muslims, chairman of the country's second-largest Muslim group said. The attack by the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) on a pro-pluralism group had undone five years of hard work spent eradicating the violent image of Indonesian Muslims after religious-based bombings and horizontal conflicts, Muhammadiyah chairman Din Syamsuddin said Thursday. ""We have to start again from square one to recapture the image of moderation after the attack,"" Din told The Jakarta Post . He said after horizontal conflicts in Central Sulawesi, Maluku and West Kalimantan as well as vertical conflicts in Aceh and several terrorist bombings in Bali and Jakarta, Indonesian Muslims had had a hard time convincing the world they were moderate and that there were only few radical groups. The image was tarnished after FPI members, armed with bamboo sticks, beat and kicked activists of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion during a rally at the National Monument park on June 1, leaving some 70 people injured. The peaceful rally was to commemorate the 63rd anniversary of Pancasila state ideology and to show support for Islamic minority sect Ahmadiyah. Before the attack, Din said, Indonesian Muslims had been gathering trust for their moderate stance. ""But with newspapers globally publishing the story of the attacks and TV stations vividly broadcasting the pictures, I can't say what kind of image we have now,"" he said. He admitted criticisms of mainstream organizations such as Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah for their failure to speak out against extremist and conservative elements were partly justified, but said the attacks should not be linked to religion. ""A violent attack is a purely criminal act and the state should take action against it. Violence has no root in Islam. It's a misuse or abuse of religion,"" Din said. ""The reason we seem to be doing nothing is because we don't want to be provoked."" Observers have criticized moderate Muslim organizations for failing to demonstrate their religious tolerance following a government decree against Ahmadiyah. They said NU and Muhammadiyah had allowed hard-line groups too much leeway in taking the public stage and claiming to represent all Indonesian Muslims. The anti-Ahmadiyah decree was issued by the government earlier this month amid intense pressure from several extremist groups, including the FPI and Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia. Din criticized the media for failing to report on the actions of moderate Muslims, compared with the coverage of radical groups. He said moderate organizations such as NU and Muhammadiyah had been very active in fostering an image of Islam that spreads blessings for all. ""We reach the majority with teachings of moderation. We fight poverty, injustice and ignorance with our education and cultural activities,"" he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/20/fpi-attacks-damage-ri-muslims039-image-muhammadiyah-chairman.html,,2008
"Sat, June 21 2008",Anti-Ahmadiyah campaign escalating,"Radical Muslims have intensified their campaign for the government to ban Ahmadiyah and for followers of the sect to return to the fold of mainstream Islam. Police in Ahmadiyah enclaves across the archipelago have beefed up security in anticipation of attacks on Ahmadis and their property. Opponents of Ahmadiyah, which started in Indonesia in 1925 and has no record of violence, have apparently exploited a recent government decree which requires Ahmadis to cease religious activities in public. Radical Muslims who consider Ahmadiyah ""heretical"" have threatened to take the law into their hands unless the government formally bans the sect whose following in Indonesia is estimated to number more than 200,000. In Tangerang, just west of Jakarta, hundreds of people of all ages picketed Ahmadiyah's An Nur Mosque in Babakan subdistrict, demanding its closure. They said the mosque had been used since it was founded in 1960 to spread heretical teachings of Islam. Nurhasan Idris, a local neighborhood chief, said the Ahmadiyah activities did not cause any trouble but added that residents were afraid their property would be attacked by mobs from outside the hamlet, as has already happened in other places. ""That's why residents demanded the Ahmadis carry out their religious activities elsewhere,"" Idris told The Jakarta Post . Attacks by outsiders on Ahmadiyah property have reportedly occurred in Sukabumi, West Java. Last month, an Ahmadiyah mosque in Parakansalak hamlet was destroyed. Tension in Sukabumi rose after mobs forcibly closed down four Ahmadiyah mosques in the neighboring Cianjur. ""We have increased the number of personnel in highly vulnerable areas such as Parakansalak and Warung Kiara,"" Sukabumi Police chief Snr. Comr. Guntor Gaffar told Antara news agency Friday. Parakansalak, known as a local Ahmadiyah enclave, has been guarded by between 20 and 30 police officers around the clock, Guntor said. In South Sulawesi, members of the fundamentalist Islam Defenders Front (FPI), which has gained infamy for its violent acts, shut down the local Ahmadiyah headquarters in the capital Makassar on Friday. There they broke up a police cordon, entered the complex and put up a ""Closed down by the South Sulawesi FPI"" sign in the office before they peacefully dispersed. The campaign against Ahmadiyah also found its way to the North Sumatra capital of Medan on Friday. Local radical Muslim leaders led a mass gathering at Al-Mashun Grand Mosque, where they repeated their demand that the government ban Ahmadiyah once and for all. In his fiery speech, cleric Syarifin Maloko also demanded that police in Jakarta unconditionally release FPI leader Rizieq Shihab. Rizieq was arrested in Jakarta for his alleged role in the FPI attack on participants of a pro-tolerance rally at the National Monument (Monas) in Jakarta on June 1, in which dozens of people were injured, some seriously. The Medan rally also demanded that police arrest leaders of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Religion and Faith who led the Monas gathering and, according to the FPI, incited the violence. -- Multa Fidrus contributed to this story from Tangerang.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/21/antiahmadiyah-campaign-escalating.html,,2008
"Sat, June 21 2008",Soft govt blamed for fledging radicalism,"Leaders of Indonesia's biggest Muslim organizations said Friday that moderate Muslims had failed to silence radical groups taking over public spaces in the country. Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah leaders said the majority's silence was caused by the pragmatic attitude of moderate Muslims and the government's failure to embrace them in countering radicalism and violence. NU deputy chairman Masdar F. Mashudi said moderate Muslims must make their voices heard through the media and mosques without neglecting their long-term objectives of educating Muslims with moderate teaching. ""It's true that moderate Muslims are kind of ignorant about doing something to fight radicalism, because most of them think it is not their business,"" the Islamic law expert said. He said although the radical groups were small, they were very vocal and capable of attracting media attention and followers. ""What is the meaning of a demonstration of 5,000 FPI followers in Jakarta compared to 12 million city residents? But since they (the FPI) took action, they were heard and people started to think it was the voice of Muslims,"" Masdar said. Muhammadiyah chairman Din Syamsuddin acknowledged there was a great silence on the part of the majority moderate Muslims in Indonesia. ""We must be active and proactive without having to be vocal in fighting violence and addressing radicalism. We must do it by example without having to be seen as talking only,"" he said. Din, however, rejected the idea of demonstrations or mass mobilization to counter radical groups, vowing to stay on educating and empowering people in economic and social life. Masdar and Din criticized President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Vice President Jusuf Kalla for ignoring the role of moderate Muslim groups in helping them fight radicalism, urging the government to work with moderate Muslims organizations, like NU and Muhammadiyah, to eradicate radicalism. Moderate Muslim organizations have come under fire for failing to demonstrate their religious tolerance following a government decree against an Islamic minority sect. Muslim scholars and political observers said that as major moderate groups, the NU and Muhammadiyah should have prevented the recent attacks by the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) against a pro-pluralism rally, and the subsequent issuance of a joint ministerial decree against Jamaah Ahmadiyah. The anti-Ahmadiyah decree was issued by the government earlier this month amid intense pressure from many extremist groups, including the FPI and Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia. Of the decree, Masdar said there was no basis in Islam to give a group's right to brand others heretical as no Islamic groups or individual could declare themselves the only truthful people. ""The fact that we must pray 17 times a day so that God can show us the right way tells us that no Muslims can claim they are already in the right,"" he said. He called on the government to set a forum for all parties to meet and discuss an end to the problems.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/21/soft-govt-blamed-fledging-radicalism.html,,2008
"Mon, June 23 2008",No way around multiple interpretations,"The controversial joint ministerial decree issued last Monday stops short of banning Ahmadiyah, but orders the sect to stop ""spreading interpretations and activities that deviate from the principal teachings of Islam"". While human rights activists have condemned the decree as a violation of the basic right to worship, hard-liners have also condemned the decree for not explicitly banning the sect. The decree has done nobody any favors, but has severely damaged the Indonesian government's reputation for being democratic. With the decree, the government has sided with a particular interpretation of Islam. This action, while not condoning the violence itself, unwittingly supports the excuses of violent groups like the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), whose leader is currently basking in the honor of visits from high-ranking state officials, politicians and celebrities -- while still in police custody for several serious offenses. What are the principle teachings of Islam? In my village mosque, I was taught as a child the five pillars of Islam and the six pillars of faith. I must have missed something, for the government's decree implies there are other principles of Islam my village teachers had clearly overlooked. Apparently the belief (stemming from a Hadith, not from the Koran) that Muhammad was the last Prophet is now also a principle of Islam, even though both Sunni and Shia schools of thought say the end of the world will bring with it a new Messiah and the second coming of Jesus. The Ahmadi belief that Mirza Gulam Ahmad was the promised Messiah is thus a ""violation"" of the basic tenets of Islam -- but the use of violence and threats in a peaceful country, as practiced by the FPI and other hard-line groups, apparently is not. By showing it can be bullied into siding with a certain interpretation of Islam, the government has created a tragic and dangerous precedent: it has moved ever closer to becoming a representative of a certain Islamic sect. This is a potential political nightmare because there exist myriad differences between sects in Islam. Shia, for instance, have a slightly different way of performing wudlu (ablutions), reciting the adzan (call to prayers) and performing shalat (prayer) from other Muslims. They also overlook the four Caliphs of early Islam, whom Sunni Muslims hold in high regard, and instead acknowledge Ali to be the rightful successor to Muhammad. The differences between Shia and Sunni are arguably deeper than the differences between Ahmadiyah and Sunni. In their devotion to Ali and his descendants, they too deviate from what could be considered the ""main principles"" of Islam by hard-line Sunni groups, now seemingly represented by the government. Will the Shia be banned from practicing their religion in Indonesia too? Several Shia followers I spoke to have expressed this fear. The Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) has issued a fatwa declaring secularism, liberalism and pluralism haram -- forbidden in Islam. Take into account the fact several MUI officials also moonlight as leaders of hard-line groups that forced the government into issuing the decree, and the bigotry comes through loud and clear. After their ""victory"" in getting the decree issued, it is highly likely these hard-liners' next step will be to demand legalized and state-enforced persecution of other minorities. Other interpretations of Islam, such as liberal Islam which has been systematically attacked by the MUI, are prey to similar crippling decrees. If one studies closely statements made by the MUI and other hard-line groups that claim to represent Indonesian Muslims, it is clear their goal is not merely the banning of Ahmadiyah, liberalism, secularism or pluralism. Their repeatedly stated aim is to establish sharia law throughout Indonesia. At every opportunity, these groups call for the reinstatement of the ""seven words"" of the 1945 Constitution. Had they not been cut from the formulation of the Pancasila philosophy, they would have obliged all Indonesians to obey sharia law. Non-Muslims would not be the only ones to suffer if sharia law was indeed to be implemented. True, non-Muslims would be second-class citizens, but once certain ""taxes"" are paid, they would receive protection and their second-class status would be much better than the status of other Muslims -- who would most certainly face persecution. Millions of Javanese Abangan Muslims, for instance, who believe in a different interpretation of Islam that does not emphasize sharia at all, would be further ridiculed, persecuted and punished. Sharia law is widely believed to be God's law, but in practice, it comes across as a savage, brutal, distinctly human creation. When a society believes it is carrying out God's will, it shuts out criticism and innovation. By blinding itself to the fact even the most clearly defined verses of the Koran are still subject to human interpretation, the movement to implement sharia law denies its humanity and claims Absolute Truth -- a privilege only God can claim. Such a movement will only lead toward a fascist dictatorship or tyranny. The groups pushing for this nightmare vision apparently do not see the irony: they are committing blasphemy in its gravest and most tragic form.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/23/no-way-around-multiple-interpretations.html,,2008
"Tue, June 24 2008",Insight: Religion is no place for the state in a democracy,"In a democratic state, religion belongs in the private domain, to the extent that it is beyond the jurisdiction of public authorities. This principle notwithstanding, Indonesia has a ministry of religious affairs, which might be understood in terms of its specific historical development. However, the power of this ministry is limited to political management and legal administration of religious life. The state's power in relation to religion in this country is required to protect the rights of every religious group to carry out their religious obligations and to pursue their religious ideals. In the period of time prior to reformasi , the state even claimed the right to determine which religions were allowed to exist and develop in Indonesia; namely Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism and Hinduism. One might legitimately raise the question as to why the state should have this entitlement to decide on the religious aspirations of its citizens. In the Indonesian context, this might be a backlash of the bitter experience of 1965 in which the atheistic spirit of the Communist Party supposedly jeopardized the state and the nation. This implies the state can take action toward and against certain religions that are proven to endanger the state's sovereignty, to do things against the Constitution or to violate the security as well as the freedom of citizens. Such entitlement can be justified because it is still within the scope of the state's power of political management and legal administration of the religious life of its citizens. If we try to apply this principle to the case of Ahmadiyah we certainly have problems. Do Ahmadiyah followers jeopardize the state's sovereignty? The answer is obviously no. Do their activities transgress the Constitution? It has to be proven. Do they endanger the security and freedom of other citizens? We have to make some distinctions in answering this question. Some followers of mainstream Islam, and especially the followers of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), might say Ahmadiyah members do not disturb the freedom of other people, but they do bring about commotion and disorientation among mainstream Islam followers owing to their different interpretation of the Koran. On the basis of this allegedly problematic situation, FPI people required the Indonesian government to disband Ahmadiyah and to deny their right to existence in Indonesia. The response of the government has been made known through the joint ministerial decree that basically consists of both a warning and an instruction, addressed to Indonesian citizens and to the followers of Ahmadiyah. With regard to the former, they should not show any support for interpretations and activities that are similar to but deviant from the basic teachings of Islam. With regard to the latter, as long as Ahmadiyah followers confess to be Muslims, they should terminate the interpretations and activities that deviate from Islamic teachings, especially the doctrine about a prophet after the Prophet Muhammad. A big question concerning religious freedom is why and on which ground the government meddles in the internal affairs of a religion and in the way people express their faith. If the difference in theological and exegetical interpretation is supposed to disturb other Muslims, this should be a matter to be settled within and among religious groupings, but by no means by government officials. The government is expected to intervene if quarrels and debates lead to physical conflict and the use of violence. Government authorities cannot solve such disputes because, first of all, they do not have the required and acknowledged erudition or scholarly expertise pertaining to the ongoing disputes. In the second place, they are not entitled to interfere in theological matters that become, as it were, internal and domestic affairs in the private domain. As a comparison, the public authorities cannot decide what the citizens of Jakarta should have for their lunch or dinner, because this is purely a private matter. The consideration that the resulting controversies have disturbed the religious composure of other people cannot become an excuse for the government to take sides in such debates at the cost of others, because it would become a bad precedent for interreligious relations and also for the proper attitude of government toward religious groupings. Let us imagine, for example, that one day Catholic people complain that the teachings of some Protestant churches tend to disturb the religious composure of Catholics in Indonesia, or the Hindus complain that the teachings of Buddhism have shaken their usual equanimity. Let us further imagine that those who feel disturbed insist on the dissolution of those religious groups who are supposedly bringing about spiritual uneasiness through their teachings, and ask the government to take action against these groups. What is the government supposed to do? If one takes the dissolution of Ahmadiyah as a precedent, the government would be expected to do the same thing in a comparatively similar situation. However, if that were the case, the government, as the main implementer of state power, would have ignored its main duty to provide its citizens with security and to protect their freedoms in leading their religious life. The point is: state authorities and government officials in particular should refrain from making political decisions on the basis of merely pragmatic reasons and for the sake of only ad hoc purposes. Such decisions might be good in solving a pressing problem at hand, but groups can take advantage and eliminate their political competitors, in the name of religion, using the hand of the government, though possibly without the government's intention or knowledge. Let us get back to basics. The obligation of the state is to protect all citizens, while the obligation of a democratic state is to prevent any kind of curtailment of the freedoms of its citizens in any field of life.

"Tue, June 24 2008",Out & About: 481-year-old Jakarta still a teenager,"How long does it take for the average person to reach maturity and take control of his or her life? Talking biologically, it may takes at least 20 years, or until a secure job of their own is in the bag. Life is still in the making when you are in your teens. This is the time when acne is despised, as well as the day a boy's voice breaks. It's also a time when girls get their first period and feel anxious about their changing bodies, as they avoid mirrors at all costs. And suddenly, life gets harder than it used to be. After a string of failed romances at schools and maybe several brawls with other students, these boys and girls find themselves looking for lives more suitable for themselves. Securing a job gives them direction and the next step is to start a family and continue the circle of life. It is a different story for cities. Things take much longer to grow. How long does it take for a city to reach its maturity and be able to offer a nice and comfortable life for its citizens? For Jakarta, 481 years has seemingly not been long enough to get things going. The city still does not offer a decent standard of living for its citizens. Almost five centuries old, Jakarta is hardly able to provide any sort of decent livelihood for people living on the riverbanks. They generally no longer bathe in the river as many did hundreds of years ago; it has become unbearably murky. Still, these people practice good sanitation to improve their lives by the river. The city remains a trading hub for people from all over the world. Trade here has brought the city the lights and colors of other cities around the world. But these imported spectacles are not enough to make the city as attractive as it once was. Hundreds of years ago, the Chinese, Europeans and Arabs competed to live in the city. Nowadays, the city attracts few foreigners. People from other provinces come here only to try and make it in the big smoke. Less than five percent of the city's 8.5 million population are foreigners. The main obstacle for the city is one of values. Citizens and their governments pay more attention to the bling bling of the city, like high-rises or whether or not the city has malls, rather than basic facilities to keep it functioning. The city has yet to update its drainage system, which further deteriorates each time the city is flooded. The busway, established on disagreements and poor planning, is the most sophisticated development we have seen in public transportation after the Dutch established the railway for the first time in 1871. Other public transportation is just as unsatisfactory and crowded as it was in several decades ago. Having too many immigrants, from inside or outside the country, is no excuse for the administration's inability to develop the city. The city has been a city of immigrants since the day its founder, Fatahillah, a king from Demak, won the small harbor city back from Portugal and changed its name from Sunda Kelapa to Jayakarta on June 22, 1527. Some think the 400-year-old city is still young. But what about Singapore, which began as a British trading post in 1819 or Bangkok, established as Thailand's capital in 1782? While these two cities developed subway systems decades ago, we are only starting to construct one, while still attempting to develop a monorail for the city. In the end, it is likely the people will change before the system or the city does. They will probably change their holiday destinations from Bogor and Bandung to the more developed Singapore or Shanghai. Even if these things change, hypocrisy and unfairness remains on all levels of society. Think about how long the administration has treated squatters as non-existent beings in the city. Think about the people who still believe in the ""trickle-down"" effect, where prosperity is supposedly automatically distributed to all, as opposed to implementing proper systems in the city. Think about how we have denied the Ahmadiyah sect and other religious groups from practicing their faiths. Looking back to the Monas attack, I hardly think Jakartans, whether Betawi or not, are going to make a greater leap towards prosperity than we already have. Members of Islamic Defendant Front (FPI) and the Alliance for Freedom of Faith and Religion are not willing to make room for their differences. The FPI and the alliance have made a statement through their actions that their differences will be settled physically, as both sides fight with their eyes shut. The state also keeps its eyes shut, meaning we need to live with unfinished business while pretending that we have moved on. Once again, all of us pretend we have no problems at all, rather than trying to solve them. -- Adisti Sukma Sawitri",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/06/24/out-amp-about-481yearold-jakarta-still-a-teenager.html,,2008

""We will give people two weeks to capture the gunman and will increase the reward to Rp 500 million if he is not arrested by then,"" said FBR leader Fadholi El Muhir on Monday. He said the forum had collected the prize money from its 1.8 million members. He said offering the reward money was the forum's way of helping hold up the law in the country. He guaranteed his members would not hurt the gunman and would just hand him over to police. He said anyone with information of the man's whereabouts could contact the FBR's headquarters on Jl.

They say the gunman, who pointed his gun at FPI members but did not shoot, provoked the group to attack the protesters, mostly members of the National Alliance for Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB). At least 70 AKKBB activists were injured in the attack. The alliance invited people to Monas to commemorate the 63rd year of Pancasila state ideology and showed support to the Ahmadiyah Islamic sect, which has been deemed ""heretical"" by the government.

"Thu, June 26 2008",Letter: Respecting differences,"One interesting point in Rocky Adiguna's letter ( The Jakarta Post , June 16) questioning the wisdom of jokes about religion is the use of the word ""wise"", which has two meanings. In one sense, it means insightful, perceptive, clarifying a truth which is otherwise hidden. For example, there is a saying that ""man did not weave the Earth's canvas; he is only one of the threads"". In this sense of wise, truth is more important than consequences. Theoretically, it would be possible to write something wise in this sense even if, due to unforeseen circumstances, nobody ever read it. In a second sense, it means prudent, expedient, bringing about a desired result. For example, an Ahmadiyah member entering an elevator with a group of FPI members would be wise to discuss topics other than religion. In this sense of wise, what matters is the favorable result, not the truth of what is said. It would be quite possible to lie, and yet still be speaking wisely. In Indonesia today, the second type of wisdom is exalted while the first is often forgotten. Monotheists proclaim the greatest knowledge is sent down from God rather than earned through experience. Muslims devote their intellect to interpretation of the Koran, rather than to insight into the world. Politicians see language as a currency with which to buy power. Their speeches aim not to reveal the truth, but to warp facts into a shape favorable to themselves. Many people devote themselves to jobs where they amass and process data to achieve a specific end -- boosting sales, speeding production, increasing profits or passing exams -- without ever assessing the deeper value of what they are doing. The outcome is a culture where what is effectual is considered wise, while what is insightful is considered superfluous. This leads to two problems. At a social level, groups orient themselves to the pursuit of short-term interests, reject dialogue and instead attempt to shut down the space for alternative viewpoints on the pretext that views other than their own are ""dangerous to society"". At a personal level, people become unable to speak and write truthfully. They become fearful of negative consequences, or else cynical, believing they can manipulate others into consenting or colluding in their particular projects. Therefore, rather than trying to restrict freedom of expression to promote the dominance of one ""authorized"" perspective, we should welcome the chance to hear as many different perspectives as possible. More generally, we should seek the truth not because we think truth is on our side, but because we are on the side of the truth.

Islam Troop Command (KLI) leader Munarman reported a man with a revolver in a photo to the city police headquarters two days after the Monas ambush on June 1. He blamed the gunman and activists of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB), who were showing support for the Ahmadiyah Islamic sect, for provoking the ambush. Earlier this week, the Betawi Brotherhood Forum (FBR) offered Rp 100 million (US$10,572) for civilians or Rp 150 million for police officers who could catch the gunman. The FBR is oftened aligned with the FPI and support the ban on the sect. Abubakar said Iskandar had only violated his duty as a police officer by leaving his post in Tangerang. He said the city police were on high alert and officers were not allowed to leave their posts that day. He said there was no data on the number of police officers following Ahmadiyah and that the National Police would not punish any officers for doing so. ""Their faith is their business,"" he said.

"Fri, June 27 2008",Letter: FPI attacks and RI Muslim image,"This is a response to an article titled ""FPI attacks damage RI Muslim image: Muhammadiyah chairman,"" ( The Jakarta Post , June 20, p. 2). Any signs of political tiptoeing and leadership from the moderate Muslim elitists is not only long overdue, but also hypocritical. They now want to douse the flames they themselves started as members of the Indonesia Ulema Council (MUI) and get political credit for it by denouncing the FPI violence. With the backing of the MUI, the government issued the decree prohibiting the Ahmadi movement from performing its activity, although it did not freeze or disband it, resulting in uncertainty and the entry of the FPI. The MUI ordered the sect shut down for deviating from true Islamic teachings. The MUI first and foremost should honor the tolerance this nation was founded on. Second, it has a duty to honor the tolerance that Islam teaches. Islam is great enough to stand on its own. There is no threat of a massive rush of converts to Ahmadi. To view the Ahmadi sect as a threat to the spirit of Islam indirectly weakens Islam itself. By setting this precedent of banning minority beliefs, the MUI has done a disservice to this country and to the moderate Muslims they represent. Instead of being used as a political vehicle by nonpolitical Muslim groups, the MUI should be disbanded once and for all.

"Thu, July 3 2008",Protect national diversity: Sultan,"Yogyakarta Governor Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono on Wednesday called on Indonesians to protect the country's diversity and prevent domination by any one religion. ""Diversity is the spirit of the country. Diversity should be viewed as a strength for the nation,"" Hamengkubuwono said in a cultural dialogue with about 60 leaders from 19 ethnic groups across the country. Hamengkubuwono said respecting diversity -- the spirit of state ideology Pancasila and the country's slogan, Bhineka Tunggal Ika (Unity in Diversity) -- should be applied by maintaining local traditions. ""Pancasila and Bhineka Tunggal Ika are local products, not imported ones. We should protect them,"" he said at the meeting, organized by the National Alliance for Unity in Diversity (ANBTI). Respecting diversity, he said, should be followed by an agreement to prevent domination by any cultural or religious groups. ""Java should not dominate other groups. Islam, as a majority religion, should not dominate other religions and faiths."" The meeting was held amid rising concerns over growing intolerance for minority groups and faiths. Last month, several members of the National Alliance for Freedom of Religions and Faith (AKKBB) were attacked by members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) during a rally at the National Monument (Monas) in Central Jakarta. FPI leader Rizieq Shihab and Islam Army Command (KLI) head Munarman have been detained over the attack. The ANBTI, along with other civil society organizations, is part of AKKBB. During the dialogue with the Yogyakarta sultan, ethnic leaders, especially from South Sulawesi, expressed concern over the enactment of sharia-inspired bylaws in some regions. ""The bylaws were proposed by a certain religious group. They do not recognize our existence as an ethnic community with different cultures,"" Atok, from the Talotang ethnic group of South Sulawesi, said. Several regencies have passed sharia bylaws that, among other things, oblige women to wear headscarves or ban them from leaving their homes at night. ""I disagree with the practice. It's domination. It should not happen if we use spirituality as an approach, instead of religion. Religions can be different, but spirituality can be the same,"" Hamengkubuwono said. Commenting on the Monas incident, the sultan said of the attackers, ""They don't have the right to live in the country if they don't respect diversity."" The dialogue was part of a five-day workshop held in Yogyakarta and joined by leaders of 19 ethnic communities from across the country. The communities include the Sawang from Belitung, Sumatra; Cigugur of Kuningan, West Java; Cirendeu of Cimahi, West Java; Kejawen faith of Yogyakarta; Anak Dalam, Jambi; Dayak Siang and Dayak Mak'anyam, Central Kalimantan; and Maratus in South Kalimantan. Young leaders from the communities are participating in a capacity-building workshop. During the workshop, participants will be trained in how to make films of their traditions and write about their daily lives. The ANBTI plans to hold an international film festival in 2010, displaying works from members of the alliance.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/07/03/protect-national-diversity-sultan.html,,2008
"Fri, July 4 2008",SMS: Police image,"Your comments on the image of the police, as the National Police celebrated their 62nd anniversary on July 1 Congratulations to the police on their 62nd anniversary. The police have to continuously change their image. Eliminating corruption should become the main job. General Sutanto, people need justice, not just promises. I am very disappointed that many police officers still use violence, as occurred at the National University (Unas). DEDE LESMANA ELO Tangerang, Banten Of all the corrupt authorities in Indonesia, the police are probably the most corrupt. The way some Indonesians play with the word ""polisi"" (police), making it becomes ""polusi"" (pollution), really says it all. SAMI Jakarta The police are still the same. Daylight robbers are still there and if you show cash to them, you will be treated well. AGUS Jakarta Are you asking about the same police force -- with over a thousand of them -- that stood by while innocent people celebrating the country's essence of Pancasila were brutally attacked by the FPI? Is this the same National Police when a crime is being committed in front of their eyes does nothing? It this the same police force that can immediately arrest protesting students and then have a student die on their watch and care, but have to go negotiate with the FPI before they make an arrest. Oh, they're great! Let's give them more chairs so they'll enjoy watching. Crime watching -- instead of crime fighting -- can be tiring. MARK CASTRO Jakarta We should appreciate their effort to change, but it's hard to believe that there's no corruption in the recruitment of new officers because there is no indication that the current police officers have passed ""a fit and proper test"" during the admission process. We can see how they act in dealing with demonstrations, like one that occurred at the National University (Unas). WIBAWA Jakarta I think police officers need to be trained on human rights issues, how to deal with angry mobs and conflict management. So far, the image of police officers has improved, but not much. WIDIANI Yogyakarta Happy anniversary to the National Police. I think police officers should get regular upgrading and refreshment to become more professional in handling demonstrations. And the South Jakarta Police chief should be responsible for the death of Maftuh, the Unas student. PRATELA Jakarta Police here are thoroughly corrupt at all levels. Until they are paid a proper salary they will remain so. Don't criticize, just pay them more. TONY Makassar, South Sulawesi I think the image of the police does not change. They haven't changed their behavior and service to the public. ASIP Bandung The police have not changed because the training is only for senior and mid-rank officers, while the junior officers who face the demonstrators never receive these trainings. MARY AFANTI Jakarta Frankly speaking, our National Police is better nowadays. Though I find that some of them treat people rudely and that they do not work professionally. Because of this, psychologists play very a important role in application process in choosing police officer in addition to a recommendation from their school to know their personalities. Y. IBRAHIM Palembang, South Sumatra It is simply too soon to see the changes. Eight years of reform efforts are up against decades of institutional misanthropy. But I highly applaud Gen. Sutanto's commitment to reform. He, along other advocates of police reform within the National Police, are true visionaries. ADI Jakarta Well, the police may have improved their riot and human rights skills but they are still extremely corrupt! Shame on them. NICHOLAS Jakarta I was really touched by the article on ""National Police still perceived as corrupt and violent"" ( The Jakarta Post , July 2). I was initiated to recruit young senior high school graduates ""from Sabang to Merauke"" for our pilots intake. Consequently we were able to select the smartest, tallest, handsomest of them all. As to the result of their services, when they graduated our flying school, they deserve a big salute. Don't worry our boys are very promising if we handle them properly.

"Fri, July 4 2008",Comparing football to religion,"Over the past few weeks in Jakarta, politicians and religious leaders have been touting the role of religion in creating peace and dialogue. But over in Germany, particularly in Mannheim and Heidelberg, all talks have revolved around football. Interestingly enough, the quarterfinal and semifinal matches in the Euro 2008 championship coincided with the second World Peace Forum in Jakarta, hosted by the second largest Muslim organization in Indonesia: Muhammadiyah. Also interesting to note is both football and religion seem to drive people into a certain fervor. Harking back to the forum and the football, religious issues hold as much interest for many Indonesians as football issues do for many Germans. Comparing religion and football might seem sacrilege at first, especially for those who view all aspects of religion as sacred in comparison to football, which to them is merely a pastime. However, it is worth contemplating the similarities. Since they were conceived, religions have permeated into almost all layers of organization in society, including politics and the economy. And in present-day Indonesia, religion cannot be separated from the political or economic problems facing the country. Football, similarly, has played an important role in today's society, particularly here in Europe. It is not a mere game, but a game involving true professionalism and management. Football, of course, has to do with life and money, and more importantly, with organizational skills. In addition, TV football analysts are religiously heeded and their witty commentary repeated ad nauseum in offices and bars the day after the match. Much in the same way religious clerics are idolized and their (not so) sage words help up as shining beacons of righteousness. Football players, too, must be as pious as pilgrims in obeying the rules of the game, otherwise they get penalized by the almighty Ref. The spectators watch with a seriousness akin to that of religious scholars reciting scriptures, afraid to miss the smallest detail. Finally, fanatic loyalty to any football club is no less intense than faith in any religion. Football fans spend money on replica T-shirts or donations for a new stadium, while religious people spend money on prayer clothes or donations for a new mosque or church. But can football really replace religion in people's lives? No, or at least not in Indonesia. Yet those who claim to be pious or religious could learn a few things about nationalism, tolerance and maturity from football fans. Football in Germany is a unifying force for nationalism, particularly among the youth. This becomes evident not only during a game, but also before and after it. German flags abound, held aloft by youths chanting "" Deutschland! Deutschland! "". When Germany defeated Italy and Turkey, euphoria bubbled over. When Germany lost to Spain in the final, gloom and resignation settled like a thick fog. And in this despair, the faithful draped their flags around their bodies. In Indonesia, on the other hand, religious radicalism has clearly eroded any sense of nationalism. Results from countless surveys indicate many Indonesian Muslims have a warped understanding of sharia law. And sharia is now frequently touted as a viable replacement for the state ideology of Pancasila. Two Indonesian lawyers -- heaven forbid there are more -- believe in this twisted form of sharia. One of them is a regular on the TV circuit, while the other is in police custody. Ironically, these miscreants, responsible for safeguarding Indonesian law, have declared Pancasila is not an official state ideology as set out in the Constitution. Instead, the blessing of the One God ( Rahmat Tuhan Yang Maha Esa ), this lawyer argues, is the foundation of the country. What he means is, of course, his own interpretation of God. In stark contrast to most Indonesians, most Germans accept defeat honorably. It is almost a certainty when Jakarta's football club loses, for their fans to run amok, accusing officials or the football association of being unfair. In Germany, I heard many fans gently murmur: "" Sie verdient ..."" (the Spanish team deserves it...), an expression also found in many daily newspapers. I also heard: "" Das ist nur ein Spiel, oder ?"" (It's only a game, isn't it?). Compare the attitude of German football supporters to that of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), whose members face trial after attacking another group in the name of religion. The leader of the FPI has made numerous TV appearances in which he blamed the victims for the violence. Equally ironic is the inordinate number of public figures who visited him. One even offered him a position as a legislative candidate for his party in the next general election. It takes one to know one, right? All things considered, football fans are so much more mature, tolerant and honest than certain religious thugs. However, establishing a good football team is much more expensive and requires more paperwork than founding a radical religious group, for which the only prerequisite is a tendency for hooliganism, intolerance and hypocrisy.

"Thu, July 10 2008",Spotlight on UWRF 2008 authors,"Ten Indonesian authors have been chosen to take part in this year's Ubud's Writers & Readers Festival (UWRF). The decision was based, in part, on how authors' works related to the festival's theme of Tri Hita Kara , a philosophy that strives for harmony between man, nature and the divine. UWRF gives young, up-and-coming writers from Indonesia the chance to step into the international literary spotlight. The ten were chosen from a pool of 35 Indonesian applicants. The selection panel consisted of seasoned journalist Wayan Juniartha as well as literary greats Ahmad Tohari, Dorothea Rosa Herliany and Linda Christanty. The meeting, which took place in Yogyakarta, was chaired by the Indonesian program coordinator, Kadek Krishna Adidharma. With boundless enthusiasm, UWRF founder and director Janet de Neefe said she was very pleased with the selection panel's recommendations. ""I am very excited about the lineup and extremely proud that the festival will be representing the freshest, most promising voices of Indonesia."" The merit of published works was the key factor in the selection process. Keeping gender and regional issues in mind, the selection panel was pleasantly surprised that half of the 10 writers were female and half were male, with authors from both rural and urban areas across Indonesia. Among the selectees was Dyah Merta, a short-story writer and novelist born in Ponorogo, East Java, and raised in Lampung. Dyah's debut novel, Peri Kecil di Sungai Nipah (Nymph of Nipah) presents a harrowing story of family intrigue, secrets and betrayals as a village gets swept up and crushed by the unstoppable wheel of development. This literary witness to a dark page in Indonesia's history describes how thugs, violence and the armed forces have become the tools of choice for Indonesia's rulers, used to convince people to hand over their entire lives -- including land, rivers, fields and peace. ""Dyah has the capacity to describe situations in detail with words that entice the imagination,"" said Wayan Juniartha. ""Her storytelling is lyrical, finding beauty while unflinchingly painting the pain of those powerless in the face of tyranny,"" he added. This aspiring writer, who currently manages an independent publishing house in Yogyakarta, said she was very pleased to be invited. ""I would also like to share the draft of my second novel, which I have been researching for the past two years,"" said Dyah. Nature lover, mountaineer, social worker, anthropologist and educator Saur Marlina Manurung, better known as Butet, was surprised to be selected, as she was not even aware of her nomination. Saur won unanimous support from the selection team for her novel Sokola Rimba ( 2007 ), an honest, humorous autobiographical account of her efforts in 1999-2004 to bring literacy and numeracy to the indigenous forest people of Jambi, Central Sumatra. In 2003, she established SOKOLA, an alternative education group for indigenous communities. Her book has earned widespread acclaim, particularly for correcting many city dwellers' beliefs and assumptions about rural communities. In her account, Butet asks readers to reconsider the meaning of civilization. Activist and writer Mohamad Guntur Romli will give the festival a first-hand account of the recent violence committed by FPI (Islam Defenders' Front) at the National Monument (Monas) in Jakarta. Receiving the news of his selection while recovering from wounds sustained at Monas, Guntur said he was delighted to have this opportunity to present his moderate views on Islam. The young writer is a theology graduate from Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. Besides serving as the editor of the Liberal Islam Network in Jakarta from 2005 to 2007, current discussion coordinator of Komunitas Utan Kayu and current editor & program manager of Jurnal Perempuan , Guntur also hosts a weekly talk show with former Indonesian president Abdurrahman Wahid on radio KBR68H. He has published six nonfiction titles that attempt to situate Islam within the context of Indonesia. His most recent book, Ustadz, Saya Sudah di Surga (I Am Finally in Heaven, Ustadz) was published by KataKita in 2007. Mashuri, from East Java and winner of the Jakarta Arts Council Novel Quest 2007, will also be present at the festival along with M. Faisi of Madura, Lily Yulianti Farid of Makassar, Dino Umahuk of Aceh, Iyut Fitra of Padang and Jakarta residents Dewi Utari and Reda Gaudiamo. ""This selection is not a competition or a literary award. Writers are selected based on their potential to be literary ambassadors for Indonesia in this international forum,"" said Indonesian program coordinator Kadek Krishna Adidharma. ""Our criteria include, but are not limited to, the author's presentation skills, aand how the author's published works relate to the theme,"" he added. -- The writer is UWRF Indonesian program coordinator",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/07/10/spotlight-uwrf-2008-authors.html,,2008
"Mon, July 21 2008",Letter: Freedom of religion,"I agree with Barker's general sentiments stated in his article, titled ""Ahmadiyah and crisis of Indonesia, Islam"" ( The Jakarta Post , July 11, p. 7), that the political situation in Indonesia is getting worse, but I feel that he failed to explain the causes properly. It is not the duty of Islam to protect law and order in this country. That responsibility rests with the state and the police. It would be a disaster if each of some 30 or more large religious associations all turned into vigilante groups. Hence, the author failed to explain how mainstream Islam should have prevented attacks against Ahmadiyah. The concepts of freedom of speech and freedom of religion are obviously different in Indonesia compared to most Western countries. In an article on July 5, The Jakarta Post quoted FPI leader Sobri Lubis openly advocating murder and violence against Ahmadiyah members, with a reminder that the full speech is on the FPI's website. If Lubis wrote or publicly said all this in Canada or some other Western countries, he would be subject to prosecution and a lengthy jail sentence. There are laws that are aimed at preventing spreading hatred, promoting violence, racism or prejudice against any social group. Most Indonesian Muslim organizations were outraged by the Danish cartoons not too long ago, although the cartoons did not contain an appeal to Christians in Europe to burn mosques or kill anyone. Where is the outrage of the same mainstream groups when the FPI leader calls on his angry mob to attack innocent people and they follow his call? Indonesia has five religions inscribed in the Constitution. To a Westerner, freedom of religion would involve freedom to worship any known or unknown religion, as well as freedom to form a new religion at any time. The fact that the government appears to disapprove of the Ahmadiyah's brand of Islam means that religious freedom in this country is restricted. This disapproval is part of the problem, which partly explains the lack of action from the police and a largely mute reaction from other Islamic groups. Does the Indonesian government apply the same standards to Sufis in Turkey or Shias in Iran? Would the Indonesian government tell any of them that they are not considered Muslims according to the Indonesian government's definition?

"Fri, August 1 2008",Police send Monas ambush suspects to city prosecutors,"Police handed over suspects and their dossiers to the Jakarta Prosecutor's Office on Thursday in the National Monument (Monas) ambush case, including Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab and Islam Troops Command (KLI) leader Munarman. ""The prosecutor's office received ten suspects and case evidence from Jakarta police detectives at 11.30 a.m.,"" spokesman for the Attorney General's Office B.D. Nainggolan said in a statement released Thursday. Police delivered a total of four dossiers for ten suspects involved in the case, he added. The ten suspects were allegedly involved in the violent attack on activists from the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB), rallying at Monas on June 1 to commemorate the 63rd anniversary of the inception of Indonesia's Pancasila state ideology. Of the ten, some were suspected of orchestrating the violence. Some 70 activists were injured during the Monas attack. The rally was also held in support of Jamaah Ahmadiyah, a minority Islamic sect recently dubbed ""heretical"" by a government panel. The government, through a joint ministerial decree, ordered Jamaah Ahmadiyah to cease all religious activities, including proselytizing, or face legal prosecution. The ban was signed by Religious Affairs Minister Maftuh Basyuni, Home Minister Mardiyanto and Attorney General Hendarman Supandji. Munarman and several other perpetrators went missing after police announced they would arrest the engineers of the ambush. After the goverment ban was issued, Munarman surrendered at Jakarta police headquarters. In the first dossier, Rizieq is charged with violating criminal code article 170 on ambush and article 156 on spreading hatred. In the second dossier, M. Matsuny Kaloko, a leader of KLI -- an FPI faction -- is charged with violating criminal code article 160 on provocation, in addition to article 170 on ambush. Munarman is charged in the third dossier with violating four articles of the criminal code: involvement in an ambush, causing damage, oppressive acts and provocation. The other seven suspects -- Agus Bambang, M. Subhan, Fahrurrozi, Sunarto, Taufik Hidayat, Raplin and Sudiran -- are each charged in the fourth dossier with violating two articles of the criminal code, on ambush and oppressive acts. A lawyer for FPI, Achmad Michdan, said the ten suspects were still in the custody of city police, even though their dossiers had been handed over to the Jakarta Prosecutor's Office.

"Fri, August 22 2008",FPI leader denies attack charges,"Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab on Thursday rejected charges against him at the Central Jakarta District Court over the National Monument (Monas) attack last June. Prosecutor Nurlini told the court Rizieq was responsible for the FPI's violent ambush on activists from the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB), who were gathered at Monas on June 1. Some 70 activists were injured during the attack on the peaceful rally, which was held in support of Muslim sect Ahmadiyah and also to commemorate the 63rd anniversary of the Pancasila state ideology. Rizieq was charged with violating Criminal Code Articles 170, for ambush, and 156, for inciting hostility, during the Monas attack. ""On May 28, the suspect delivered a speech at the Al-Islam mosque on Jl. Petamburan 3 to several members, asking them to wage war against Ahmadiyah,"" she said, adding this incited FPI members, thus leading to the attack. When presiding judge Panusunan Harahap asked Rizieq whether he understood the charges, the FPI leader promptly replied he did not understand them. ""I don't get it. What violence? I was not at Monas on that day, and if I am charged for inciting hostility, then the President, who campaigns against corruption, is also guilty of inciting hatred against corrupt officials!"" he said. Nurlini said prosecutors would call 38 witnesses, but the presiding judge asked them to narrow their selection to only relevant witnesses. Achmad Michdan, one of 22 lawyers representing the FPI, said he was confident the witnesses did not have strong evidence to prove Rizieq's alleged involvement in the attack. ""The witnesses are not a problem for us,"" he said. He added the lawyers had filed a complaint over the Jakarta Prosecutor's Office's late request to extend Rizieq's detention. ""The detention ended on August 19, but we received the request for an extension on August 20,"" he said. On Wednesday, an attorney from the Jakarta Prosecutor's Office filed a document at city police headquarters to shift Rizieq from prosecutor-mandated detention to court-mandated detention, effective for 30 days from August 12.

Prosecutor Sigit J. Pribadi told the court Munarman incited the June 1 ambush against activists from the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB). Some 70 activists were injured during the peaceful rally in support of the Muslim sect Ahmadiyah. Munarman has been charged with violating criminal code article 170 on ambush, article 406 on property damage, article 351 on torture and Article 160 on provocation, Sigit said, adding the maximum punishment was seven years in prison, as stated in article 170. ""When the defendant heard there were members of a group called AKKBB near the site, he and his followers went to the eastern side of Monas park to get a look. Later, the defendant made a gesture with his hand -- pointing at the AKKBB group -- signaling his followers to start the attack,"" Sigit read out in court. According to the prosecutor's dossier, Munarman also shouted ""Destroy the car!"", leading to an attack on AKKBB's sound system vehicle, as well as on activist Yakobus Edi Yuwono. Munarman, former chairman of the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute Foundation (YLBHI), complained about the prosecutor's handling of his extension letter. ""While I was in detention, the prosecutor was late in providing the extension letter by 16 hours and ten minutes. That's actually a grave violation of my human rights! I forgive the prosecutor, but I hope this won't happen again in the future,"" he said. Before the court session ended, Munarman's lawyers asked presiding judge Panusunan Harahap to shorten their client's detention period, as he needed to accompany his pregnant wife. ""The defendant's wife will give birth in the very near future,"" M. Assegaf, one of the lawyers, said. Panusunan said the request would be discussed in the next trial session, which will be held next Thursday, the same day the trial for Islam Defenders Front (FPI) member, Rizieq Shihab, is set to continue.

"Sat, August 30 2008",Editorial: Ramadan sweeping,"ADPARA>The government has often seemed powerless in its response to small but noisy (and often violent) groups who use religion as a reason or pretext to take justice into their own hands. Such groups seem to believe using violence (in various forms) against others is OK because God is always on their side. It has become routine for such groups to issue threats before Ramadan; that they will use force to close nightspots or entertainment activities throughout the fasting month. However, it is also clear that by law, only police and law enforcement agencies have the right to enforce the law and government regulations. But the controversy surrounding nightspots comes up every Ramadan (the Muslim holy month), even though there have been ordinances in Jakarta and other Indonesian regions to regulate the operation of entertainment facilities at these times. This year, once again, members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) have threatened to ransack nightspots which remain open, particularly if police do not close them. ""If they (nightspot operators) still choose to operate (during Ramadan) we will take action against them,"" Bekasi FPI executive Muhammad Tamin Pardede said as quoted by the press recently. In previous years, members of this organization went to nightspots in Greater Jakarta (and other places across Indonesia) vandalizing property and scaring entertainment facility patrons. Whatever their reasoning, it is deplorable that there is an organization which is taking the law into their own hands. What would happen if other organizations do the same thing in response to other controversial issues? We call on the government to make sure the leaders of this organization (and other similar groups) do not repeat their previous mistakes. These groups do not have authority to conduct these raids. Allowing such blatant disregard for the law will lead this country into a state of lawlessness. We also hope Jakarta police spokesman Sr. Comr. I Ketut Untung Yoga Ana was sincere in his promise to ""uphold the law seriously this year"" -- not merely providing lip service. The police need to crack down both on people who take the law into their own hands, and on nightspots which remain open during the holy month. In Jakarta, the city administration has imposed restrictions on nightspots during the fasting month, under the 2004 tourism bylaw. Under these regulations, entertainment centers including night clubs, discotheques, massage and sauna parlors are prohibited from operating during the fasting month. Other facilities like karaoke, live music centers and billiard halls are allowed to remain open. Violators can face up to three months in prison and/or fines of up to Rp 5 million (US$543). The bylaw also authorizes the city administration to forcibly close any facilities which violate the ruling. Similar regulations also exist in other parts of Indonesia. So why do the same problems keep coming back, year after year? First, this is really a problem of law enforcement. So far, police have been hesitant to do their job, and reluctant to take action against nightspot operators who violate the regulation. The police have also failed to take serious action against groups who illegally raid such facilities. Consequently, these groups are now daring to repeat their raids and have even launched an open threat against nightspots. Second, we question the fairness of the ruling in the bylaw which excludes facilities operated by star-rated hotels. This has often sparked jealousy between entertainment operators. Minorities have also questioned the fairness of the regulation because it also affects them. And why are there no such regulations exclusively for Muslims? Take for example what happens in Malaysia. The Islamic country has gambling facilities in Genteng Highland which are only for non-Muslim communities. The Malaysian government strictly prohibits Muslims from entering these gambling dens. As for the prohibition of nightspots during Ramadan, there is no other way but to uphold the law. Since there are regulations in place, police must do their job to make sure the laws are enforced, otherwise this will serve as a sign that it is OK for certain groups to take the law into their own hands.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/08/30/editorial-ramadan-sweeping.html,,2008

"Tue, September 2 2008",Two witnesses testify in FPI leader's Monas trial,"Two witnesses testified Monday in a case brought against Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Syihab at the Central Jakarta District Court over the National Monument (Monas) attack last June. Ahmad Suaedi from the Wahid Institute and Mugiyono, a police officer at the Eastern Monas police post in Central Jakarta, appeared before the court. During the hearing, presiding judge Panusunan Harahap asked Ahmad why the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) mentioned the Muslim sect Ahmadiyah in its invitation published in the media concerning its event on June 1. The event was held in support of Ahmadiyah and to celebrate the 63rd anniversary of the Pancasila state ideology. The mention of ""Ahmadiyah"" on the invitation triggered a concentration of groups of people who later attacked AKKBB activists at Monas park. Ahmad said the invitation indicated there were ""some parties"" that carried out violence against Ahmadiyah followers across the country and he referred in this respect to FPI. ""FPI often did (violence against Ahmadiyah),"" said Ahmad as quoted by Antara , adding that he had made observations to verify this. His statement was booed by dozens of FPI followers who attended the hearing. Rizieq was charged with violating Criminal Code Articles 170, for ambush and 156, for inciting hostility, during the Monas attack. Some 70 activists were injured during the attack on the peaceful rally. According to prosecutor Asep Mulyana, Rizieq might face four to seven years in jail. Another suspect in the same case, Islam Troop Command (KLI) leader Munarman faced up to seven years in prison on Friday. He has been charged with violating criminal code article 170 on ambush, article 406 on damage to property, article 351 on torture and Article 160 on provocation. Rizieq's and Munarman's trials are always attended by dozens of supporters of FPI and KLI. Last week, AKKBB activists reported FPI supporters to the Jakarta Police over alleged violence towards one of their group. FPI supporters were reported to get angry at an activist's statement; they allegedly then pulled her hair and her shirt at the Central Jakarta District Court.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/09/02/two-witnesses-testify-fpi-leader039s-monas-trial.html,,2008
"Thu, September 4 2008",Forum: FPI initiated the attack,"Of course Islam Defenders Front (FPI) started the attack. FPI's thirst for violence has been well documented from strings of thug-like, holier-than-thou attitudes -- seen when they force restaurants to close during Ramadan, when they march on and disband churches and Ahmadiyah mosques, and when they marched on the Playboy Magazine office. And now their lawyer says because the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) ""provoked"" FPI, the violence against women, children and men (trying to protect their families) should go unpunished? The spirit of Pancasila means every religion has the right to exist, far from the repressive actions of the state or any other institution. That spirit is now buried deep underneath texts, opinions, legal rulings, shouts, yells and marches of certain parties who want only their religion and ideas to exist above others. YAN Jakarta Well, as we know from the police, AKKBB was not supposed to even be at Monas. The police had not given them a permit to be at Monas and again repeatedly the police warned AKKBB, and they understood this. I wonder why, then, AKKB persistently strolled over Monas to meet up with a group which they know holds different views and surprise ... we know the rest of the story. Yes, no one agrees with violence but there is always two sides to a story and, Yan, you'd better get your facts straight. Oh yeah, one thing is for sure; someone from AKKBB was armed with a gun and did the police take action? Hmmm hopefully. DUH Jakarta Mahfud on Sharia bylaws Absolutely! Indonesia is based on Pancasila and it is a democratic country. Though it is known to be a Muslim majority country, this doesn't mean sharia laws can be applied here. This would be an injustice to other religions. Muslims should try to put their feet next to others and never push the government to use sharia laws. MEIDI Jakarta",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/09/04/forum-fpi-initiated-attack.html,,2008
"Thu, September 4 2008",Welcoming Ramadan: The audacity of sanity,"During the weeks before Ramadan, the Islamic fasting month, we received good news and bad news. That Mahfud MD, the new head of the Constitutional Court, slammed sharia bylaws in less than 24 hours after being sworn in is good news. That a Muslim mob has driven Christians to leave their campus is bad news. Many members of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) went to the streets again to demand both their leader's release from police custody and the banning of Ahmadiyah, horrifying news. Minister of Religious Affairs Maftuh Basyuni guaranteed the government will not issue any Presidential regulation to outlaw Ahmadiyah, which is a relief. In addition, the FPI has already unleashed an assault against a certain kiosk they suspect of selling alcohol. Give me a break. I don't want to hear any more awful news. The old Javanese saying, sing waras ngalah (The sane should recoil), is no longer relevant for the above-mentioned news. On the contrary, those still in control who are exercising full wisdom and reason should fight back. The silent majority, who disagree with any form of violence and intolerance, should raise their voices to counterbalance those who do not believe in the use of human reason. Now that Mahfud MD has shown his courage, others should be inspired by it. Once again, we should show our willingness to stand behind Mahfud. It is not true that sharia-inspired bylaws, already adopted by some 480 regencies, will strengthen the Muslim community in Indonesia. That's the argument radicals have tried to sell us. What is correct is that these sharia ordinances will -- and in many instances have already -- become a hurdle for Indonesian Muslims to overcome. These bylaws only put forth a limited version of sharia dictated by the local governments, who have based their initiatives neither on the advice of competent Muslim scholars nor on the reading of the rich body of literature on the subject. Instead, a significant number of sharia bylaws are products of copy-paste. Verse by verse and word by word, certain regions have taken regulations from other regions. Pathetic as it may sound, those local governments are defining what sharia means for their fellow local Muslims. Take a wild guess whether those local governments have taken the local needs and demands into consideration or not. True, the annulment of sharia bylaws will help Indonesian Muslims rediscover their own identity. They do not require literal and immature versions of sharia to help them behave as better Muslims. Nor do they need local governments to guide and spy on them as they carry out their religious duties. What Indonesian Muslims need is to be proud to be Indonesians, whose cultures, traditions, and wisdom are distinct from other Muslims in the world. In fact, each Muslim culture in the world offers its own way to contribute to humanity. It is false that annulling immature sharia interpretations encoded in many local ordinances will threaten Indonesian Muslims. Annulling them will instead undermine those who exploit Muslim sentiment for political and other purposes. As for the Ministry of Religious Affairs of Indonesia, its long tradition has so far hatched many progressive ideas in the course of the history of Indonesian Muslims. It is worth recalling that Mukti Ali, a minister under Soeharto, may be one of the most important fathers of religious dialogue in Indonesia. Mukti Ali coined the phrase ""agreement in disagreement"" in calling for maintaining harmonious relations among many religious communities. In interpreting Islamic inheritance law, Munawir Sadzali, another New Order minister, also boldly proposed men and women should inherit equal shares. The torch of progressive tradition in that ministry passed to Tarmizi Tahir whose enthusiasm for sending Indonesian students abroad to broaden the perspective of Islamic studies in Indonesia was apparent. This open-mindedness should not be extinguished. The torch now rests in Maftuh Basyuni's hands, and his duty is to keep it ablaze. His statement negating any ban against Ahmadiyah should be interpreted as his initial step in restoring the tradition of that ministry under his administration. It is time for both Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah to lend support to Mahfud. Let the past frictions between NU and Muhammadiyah become history so they can stand shoulder to shoulder to fight against radicalism. A new kind of santri , or observant Muslim, has emerged in the aftermath of reformation and challenged the older type of santri . These new santri have gone astray, betraying the old tradition, which is deeply rooted in NU and Muhammadiyah. Thus, only these two organizations can guide their ummah (community of Muslims) to rediscover truly Indonesian Islam. The writer is a lecturer at State Islamic University Sunan Kalijaga Yogyakarta.

"Tue, September 16 2008",Monas rally ambush witnesses announce trial boycott,"Witnesses from the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) announced they would boycott trials on the June ambush at the National Monument (Monas) park after one of their activists was assaulted outside the courtroom Monday. ""We plan to boycott the upcoming trials because the prosecutors have failed to protect us. We feel intimidated,"" M. Guntur Romli, an AKKBB activist as well as a victim and witness of the June ambush, told The Jakarta Post . He said during the trial of the Islam Troop Command leader Munarman, he had asked a police officer guarding the trial why seven of the 10 suspects in the ambush, purportedly members of the Islam Defender Front (FPI), were allowed to wander freely outside the courtroom. ""They defendants were laughing and chatting with their fellow FPI members during Munarman's trial. I don't understand why they were not in detention,"" Guntur said. The police officer said he did not recognize the seven, so Guntur asked another activist, Nong Darol, to check with the prosecutors. ""Nong told the police the seven people were suspects. The policeman started to scold me instead, saying 'What are you up to?' repeatedly,"" Guntur said. He said the police officer's loud voice attracted the attention of many FPI members. ""They surrounded us, one of them beat Nong on her forehead and abdomen. Some plainclothes officers then took us to a witness room while others tried to hold the seven suspects who had harassed us,"" he said. Guntur said the activists were also considering two other options besides a boycott: mobilizing more people to protect AKKBB witnesses during the trial or reporting the assault to the police. ""The court cannot protect us, the witnesses,"" he said, adding the defendants and their supporters should be strictly supervised. A lawyer representing FPI, Achmad Michdan, said FPI members would not beat a woman. ""But there was a woman attending the hearing whose comments infuriated other defendants who had just finished their hearing in a separate courtroom,"" he told the Post . On June 1, AKKBB staged a peaceful rally in support of the Ahmadiyah community and to celebrate the 63rd anniversary of the establishment of the Pancasila state ideology. Ahmadiyah, a minority Islamic sect, has been dubbed heretical and therefore their activities have been restricted by the government. Some 70 activists attending the rally were injured when allegedly attacked by FPI adherents. Earlier in the day, the trial of FPI leader Rizieq Shihab turned ugly as the defendant's supporters began to protest against presiding judge Panusunan Harahap for failing to rule on the defendant's request his detention be suspended. Panusunan, who had already had one FPI supporter removed from the courtroom for contempt of court, immediately adjourned the hearing. FPI lawyer Ari Yusuf Amir said the panel of judges was biased. ""If the judges show prejudice, there should be no trial at all,"" he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/09/16/monas-rally-ambush-witnesses-announce-trial-boycott.html,,2008
"Wed, September 17 2008",Witnesses urge court to shield them from harassment,"Members of the National Alliance for Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) decided not to appear as witnesses in court Thursday without a security guarantee from the Central Jakarta District Court. ""We need the court to guarantee we will not have to deal with similar physical threats,"" Nong Darol Mahmada, an activist responsible for the safety of witnesses for AKKBB, told reporters Tuesday. The decision was made following an assault on Nong outside a courtroom on Monday allegedly by members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). They were at the court to support FPI leaders on trial for allegedly mobilizing their members to attack the AKKBB activists during a peaceful rally in the National Monument (Monas) park on June 1. During the trial of Islam Troop Command leader Munarman, Nong said she left the courtroom to help a friend explain to a police officer that seven people wandering around outside the courtroom were defendants in the ambush case. Her friend, M. Guntur Romli, a victim of the ambush and a witness that day, questioned the police officer why the defendants were allowed to walk freely after their court hearing. During the heated conversation with the police officer, who did not believe that the seven people were defendants, Nong said, a man started shouting, ""Provocateur!"" and many people wearing FPI insignia or characteristic white robes surrounded her and Guntur. ""Then everything happened fast. Suddenly someone hit me in the forehead. When we were being taken to a witness room to get away from the seven defendants who were harassing us, a man groped me, pinched my waist and hit me in the abdomen,"" she said. She said she recognized the man who had assaulted her. The report was quickly denied by Achmad Michdan, a lawyer helping defend FPI, who said FPI members would not beat women. AKKBB also urged the Jakarta Prosecutor's Office to protect their witnesses from the FPI supporters and to forbid the defendants from walking around freely in the court building. ""They're dangerous. We feel intimidated because they can walk around freely and confront us when they know we're giving testimony against them,"" Nong said. Firdaus Mubarik, another AKKBB activist, said he was threatened by a man wearing FPI insignia when he attended a court hearing last week. ""The man grabbed my neck and told the other FPI members that he recognized me as an AKKBB activist from TV. He said, 'Let's fry him', and tried to take my picture with his cell phone camera."" Firdaus said he felt intimidated and decided to leave the court before the hearing ended. Patra M. Zen, chair of the Foundation for the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute, said the violence was a test of the court's credibility. ""The presiding judge can ask for maximum security from the police to protect these witnesses,"" he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/09/17/witnesses-urge-court-shield-them-harassment.html,,2008
"Sun, September 21 2008",Highlight gala of the month,"Idul Fitri's coming, the geese are getting fat. Well, maybe not the geese perhaps but the population in general almost certainly. It's long been a fact of life in Jakarta that during the ""fasting"" month, more food is consumed than at any other time of the year. Far from Ramadan being a time to distance oneself from corporeal appetites and focus one's thoughts on the divine, the holy month in Jakarta is a time of inflation, unexpected traffic jams at odd hours and, above all, heroic feats of fast-breaking gluttony. Stroll into any shopping mall food court just after 6 p.m. and you could be mistaken for thinking that you blundered into some crazed Coney Island hotdog eating contest only with the dogs replaced by fried rice and the time-honored charms of the baso ball. If you can find anything left to chow down on you'll then have the challenge of finding somewhere to sit among the assembled sambal -oholics. The gustation continues in earnest into the wee hours as hungry followers of the world's fastest-growing faith try and shovel in an amount of carbohydrates that would have top Olympian Michael Phelps reaching for the Pepsobismol. Why the calorie levels go off the scale to the extent that they do during the fasting month is anyone's guess. Perhaps it's just like Catholic schoolboys and self-abuse: The prohibition only makes them want to do it more. After the bull seals have gorged and built up reserves of fat that should see them through a hard winter's sitting in traffic, it's off home to watch a few sinetron soap operas in which the usual philanderers and white-collar criminals are now suddenly seen sporting religious garb, a pious overlay that only serves to add a layer of deviousness to their skulduggery. Fasting and then gorging like this leave a bad taste in the mouth (that'll be the baso ) in a country where malnutrition still runs rife. Many in far-flung provinces don't have the option of the 6 p.m. bloat out and sleep on empty stomachs, regardless of their religion. Of course there is the Muslim tradition of giving alms to the poor during Ramadan but you sometimes wonder who extracts the most benefit out of this, the poor receiving their paltry kilo of rice or the rich whose consciences are salved by such annual displays of extremely modest largesse. Certainly the poor of East Java didn't fare very well this week, 21 of them dying in a stampede of thousands as they tried to get their calloused mittens on a miserable Rp 40,000. From the perspective of an infidel atheist (who is kind to small animals I might add) science is an important lens through which to view the strangeness of religious rituals such as fasting. Evolutionary biology and anthropology tell us that the ascetic rigor and exclusivity of the world's three main monotheisms originated in one of the world's harshest environments (outside of the Arctic Circle). Conversely, more fertile, tropical areas of the planet tend to give rise to more inclusive, laid-back, polytheistic religions. This can be no coincidence surely. Indonesia's easy-going Epicurean fertility tends to the latter but has had the strictness of the former overlaid over the top as an inflexible moral template in recent centuries. The harsh mind-set of the desert doesn't come easily here and it's perhaps this mismatch between intention and desire that has led to the country's delusional, dishonest and corrupt social and political culture. But that's enough theorizing for now. Actually thinking again about the Arctic Circle, it's amazing that the Eskimos didn't come up with something even more totalitarian than our desert-influenced monotheisms. Those icy winds should surely have put some steely zeal in their hearts. I guess the fasting would be a problem though if there were six months of daylight at a time. A crash diet like that could have serious consequences although possibly the rotund Gus Dur would still be going strong when the sun finally set after half a year. Thankfully this year the FPI (Islamic Popular Front) have again been quiet and have refrained from smashing up bars with big sticks. The FPI's blinkered and childishly reductive interpretations of their religion are clearly a treasonous insult to the traditions of scholarship and debate that lie at Islam's birth. Unfortunately, though, the pornography bill, a draconian piece of legislation designed to stop people kissing their spouse in public or wearing skimpy outfits, looks set to be passed during the next week as, and I quote,""A Ramadan gift,"" to the people. Indonesia's politicians certainly know all about gifts that's for sure, although usually they are the kind given in brown envelopes. On the bright side though, I'm looking forward to mass bikini-clad anti-porn bill protests in the New Year. The Jakarta Post this week summed up the whole controversy brilliantly with a perhaps unintentionally punning headline that read,"" Resistance Mounts Against Porn Bill"".

"Mon, September 22 2008",Peace 'cannot be separated from justice',"People are longing and struggling for peace, although it's painful for some. ""Peace is beautiful if there is justice,"" Sumarsih, whose son Bernardus Realino Norma Irmawan or Wawan was killed in the Semanggi shooting incident in 1998, told a discussion to commemorate the International Day of Peace Vigil at the Legal Aid Foundation Institution (YLBHI), on Sunday. Sumarsih has painstakingly been seeking justice following the death of her son and another 13 people when security personnel opened fire to push back protesters near the Semanggi cloverleaf in Jakarta over a decade ago. ""They all died from live bullets. We only want the case to be brought to court. That does not mean that we have a grudge or we are still looking at the past, but we insist that the case must end in court to prevent similar cases from happening,"" she said. The National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) has concluded the incident was a crime against humanity. But the Attorney General's Office (AGO) hesitates to continue investigations into the case, dashing any hopes of Sumarsih and the families of those killed in the incident that they might find those responsible for the shooting. Sumarsih said she only wanted the parties responsible for the incident to receive punishment, which she said would deter others from making similar mistakes. ""As long as the guilty parties escape justice, we can be sure that we will continue to see violence and human rights violations occur in this country over and over again,"" Sumarsih said. In her effort to encourage the government to settle the case, she pledged to continue to stage a protest outside the presidential palace every Thursday. This Thursday will be the 83rd time she calls on the government to heed her demand. Guntur Romli, one of the victims of the attack on freedom of religion supporters who gathered at the National Monument (Monas) incident last June, expressed his concern for peace, which has remained elusive in the country. He was among activists from the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) who rallied at Monas to commemorate the 63rd anniversary of the inception of Indonesia's Pancasila State ideology, when a group of people from the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and Islam Troops Command ambushed them. The attack injured 70 people. ""It seems like people are finding it hard to accept diversity and the state does not even provide us enough protection. Our sense of security is now fading away,"" he said. FPI leader Rizieq Shihab and Munarman are standing trial for causing the violence. Obertina Modesta, a preacher from Bandung, also shared her skepticism of the government's commitment to maintaining peace in this diverse country. She said her congregation had stopped activities in their church in Dayeuh Kolot due to intimidation from hard-line groups. ""We have received constant intimidation from groups of people who claim to represent the Anti Apostasy Movement Alliance (AGAP) and Anti Apostasy Body (BAP). They have caused us to move our religious activities to a hospital,"" she said. She added that she had reported the violence to the police, but that to date no actions had been taken against the groups.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/09/22/peace-039cannot-be-separated-justice039.html,,2008

Presiding judge Panusunan Harahap said the trials would be adjourned to Thursday to hear the witnesses scheduled for Monday.

On June 1, activists from the National Alliance for Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) who were taking part in a peaceful rally in a show of support for the Ahmadiyah community, were ambushed and assaulted by supporters of the two hard-line Islamic groups. Panusunan warned the court audience, mostly FPI supporters, to behave or force the trials to be conducted in closed sessions. A separate trial of seven FPI members turned ugly after one of them attacked a witness and victim of the ambush, right after the latter had finished testifying.

"Fri, September 26 2008",Groups skirmish during Rizieq trial,"Members of two organizations clashed outside the Central Jakarta district court building Thursday as Rizieq Shihab's trial continues. Supporters of the Islamic hardline group Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and a group of men clad in T-shirts emblazoned with the word Banser -- a paramilitary group tied to another Islamic organization, Nahdlatul Ulama -- came to blows during the trial's midday break. Thursday was the ninth day of hearings in Rizieq's trial. He is charged with allegedly inciting his supporters to riot by attacking a rally promoting religious tolerance at National Monument (Monas) park June 1. Four people wearing Banser T-shirts and three FPI supporters were injured during the Thursday fracas. Sultan, a witness, said both sides had also thrown stones at each other. Both sides claimed that the other party had been the aggressor. In the afternoon session of Rizieq's trial, immediately after the clash, Rizieq told presiding judge Panusunan Harahap that his FPI members were attacked by a group of ""paid thugs"". He asked the prosecutors directly whether they were responsible. ""Did you bring the thugs in? There were 33 of them. My members were injured during the attack!"" Rizieq said loudly, adding that the ""thugs"" had been carrying sharp weapons, including a sickle. He said a third party might have been trying to create havoc between Banser and FPI since the apparent ""thugs"" were wearing Banser T-shirts. M. Guntur Romli denied Rizieq's suggestion of third party involvement on his part. Guntur is a member of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB), organizers of the June 1 rally. ""It was not a clash! We were attacked and none of the Banser members carried weapons. They came to the district court to show support for us. They're members of Gus Nuril's Banser,"" he told The Jakarta Post . He said the 33 men wearing Banser T-shirts came showed up to support him and other witnesses in the June 1 Monas ambush case. The witnesses had planned to hand out a letter stating that they were boycotting the trial because they had not gotten a safety guarantee from court authorities. ""Just as we were about to stop public buses in front of the Pelni building, about 300 meters from the district court building, we were attacked,"" Guntur said. After the clash, three FPI supporters who suffered minor injuries and a man named Ali came to city police headquarters to report the attack and related threats. Ali said he reported Guntur for threatening him as he passed through the court's entry gate. ""Guntur said he would kill me,"" he said. Guntur denied Ali's statement, and said Ali had been the man who had threatened him during his previous court appearance Monday.

"Sat, September 27 2008",LBH Palembang supports Ahmadiyah ban,"The Legal Aid Institute's Palembang chapter has announced its support for a recent ban issued against the Ahmadiyah sect by the South Sumatra administration. LBH Palembang director Eti Gustini said his organization's support was given following an agreement made with local Muslim organizations over the matter, in which the latter conveyed a letter of support to the LBH. Both parties strongly opposed the intervention of the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute Foundation (YLBHI), which is to file a lawsuit against the gubernatorial decree in the State Administrative Court (PTUN). ""Although we're under the auspices of the YLBHI, we're ready to obstruct the legal process they hope to start. We have agreed to unite against Ahmadiyah teachings in line with the joint ministerial decree,"" Eti said. Leader of the provincial chapter of the Islamic Forum (FUI) Umar Said said Muslim organizations would support LBH's decision at all costs. According to Umar, support has come not only from Muslim organizations across the province, but from the entire Muslim community, which deems Ahmadiyah teachings heretical. His group is determined to defend the gubernatorial decree even if that means breaking the law, he said. ""Ahmadiyah is a deviant doctrine. It would be improper for the YLBHI to file a suit against the decree because if such tolerance existed, why were other heretical teachings banned? All Muslims must oppose the suit on the basis of our common faith,"" he said. Head of the Indonesian Mujahidin Council's (MMI) South Sumatra chapter Arfan M. Alwi said Ahmadiyah teachings were a betrayal of Islam. ""The ban is the right thing to do. The Ahmadis have two choices: immediately repent to God or make a new name for their religion. Don't hitch onto Islam,"" he said. Secretary of the local chapter of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) Habib Mahdi Muhammad Syahab said the FPI remained firm in its opposition to the spread of Ahmadiyah teachings in Indonesia, especially in South Sumatra. His group has reached consensus and is committed to resisting Ahmadiyah teachings in South Sumatra, he said, adding no one has been able to sow dissent among Muslim organizations in the province.

"Tue, September 30 2008",Idul Fitri and Christmas have similar substances,"Idul Fitri and Christmas bear a substantial similarity to each other: their human side. It is true -- from a theological perspective -- that both celebrations have to do with a man's business with his God. Yet, in real life, the two involve more a man's business with other men than man's business with his God. During the days prior to Idul Fitri, Indonesian Muslims are always eager to go back to their home towns ( mudik ) to spend their holidays with their relatives and close friends. Unfortunately, competition is stiff for the already incredibly steeply priced bus, train, airplane, and boat tickets. Many, alternatively, decide to mudik with their motorcycles, riding from one end of the long island of Java to the other, or points in between. The same pattern occurs during the Christmas holidays in both Germany and Canada, as reflected in the soaring price of airplane tickets. Christmas is a human holiday. So is Idul Fitri. Sadly, the price of every basic commodity in Indonesia -- from chili peppers to flour -- in the days leading up to Idul Fitri has soared unbelievably. In Canada and Germany, however, prices for such staples remain steady in the weeks before Christmas. While every Idul Fitri numerous car accidents along Java's northern coastal route embellish our newspaper pages, no comparable tragic stories come out of Germany and Canada during Christmas. Last Christmas, I went to Luxembourg by train with some friends. I still remember a newspaper article I read during the trip which laid out the history of how Dec. 25 was chosen as the day to commemorate Christ's birth. The early Church converted the winter festival of pagan Romans -- celebrated on Dec. 25 just after the winter solstice -- into the Christmas celebration. Many scholars tell us the exact date of Jesus' birth remains puzzling. Most ordinary modern people, nonetheless, accept the holiday without bothering to question it. The Idul Fitri celebration is a much later human invention and a good one. In most Middle Eastern Muslim countries, Idul Adha, or the day of sacrifice, is given more importance than Idul Fitri, primarily because Idul Adha occurs during the haj season, when millions of Muslims from all over the world go on pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. On that day they sacrifice animals in the holy land. Indonesian Muslims, however, celebrate Idul Fitri more keenly than Idul Adha. Halal bihalal -- a feast with colorful yummy Indonesian foods during which younger people confess their sins to older ones ( sungkeman ) -- is a truly Indonesian Islamic innovation ( bid'ah ). No Koran verse nor prophetic tradition commands Muslims to hold these events. Last Easter, I attended a ceremony in a church behind Heidelberg University's philosophy faculty. I listened carefully as a priest read the story of the suffering, crucified Jesus, which touched me greatly. I imagined the same happened in the sirah writings which recount the life of the Prophet Muhammad during the Meccan period during which his Quraishite fellows vehemently opposed his prophetic mission. An Easter choir at the church glorified God. Likewise, the night before Idul Fitri Muslims chant, also proclaiming, ""God is great."" However, in Indonesia of late, this formula has been oft recited in the wrong place and wrong time for the wrong purpose. The mantra has been abused to scare other people. During the trial of their leader, Habib Rizieq, some FPI (Islam Defenders Front) members flooded the courtroom and disrupted it with their annoying chants. Musdah Mulia, a prominent Indonesian Muslim feminist, attested to this. Additionally, Muhammad Guntur Romli, a witness and one of the seventy injured during the Monas fracas -- the back story for the courtroom dramatics -- was terrorized with their misbehavior. And the story is not over yet. Nong Darul Mahmada, another victim, was also threatened and sexually abused by these members. Not only did these acts go against court ethics, they also insulted a sacred creed. You can bet we will soon see some people roaring ""God is great"" on the streets again to support the proposed anti-pornography bill. If they do, it is because they intend to deter critics of that bigoted bill, which, of course, hardly appreciates human freedom and choice in a democratic country. Indeed, this formula of ""God is great"" is neutral. It can be used for either virtuous or nasty purposes. One can intone it to remind us of the greatness of God for freeing many prophets and heroes from difficulties -- ranging from Abraham to Abraham Lincoln, from Jesus to Malcolm X, from Muhammad to Sukarno, and from Siddhartha Gautama to M. Hatta. The FPI's use of the phrase, on the other hand, offers nasty examples. The increased use of sacred symbols hand in hand with dreadful deeds is no longer an unexpected juxtaposition. The growing number of mosques, as Mustafa Bisri once satirized, is accompanied by a parallel growth in corruption cases. ""God is great"", however, should be invoked when you are oppressed, not when you are torturing others. You should praise God's glory when trying to relieve others' burdens, not when threatening them. The time for reciting ""God is great"" during Idul Fitri celebrations is appropriate, due to its human side. The greatness of God is accompanied by hugs, smiles, hand-shaking, confession, forgiving others, and eating traditional Indonesian foods -- from ketupat , boiled rice cake wrapped in woven coconut leaf packets, to onde-onde , sticky rice balls covered with sesame seeds.

"Tue, October 14 2008",Hard-line leaders could face two years in prison,"Prosecutors on Monday demanded a two-year prison sentence for hard-line Islamic leaders Rizieq Shihab and Munarman for their alleged involvement in an attack on a peaceful rally in June. In separate hearings at the Central Jakarta District Court, defense lawyers said there was no convincing evidence to convict the men, and added they would prepare their rebuttals for next week's hearing. Rizieq, chairman of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), is accused of masterminding the attack on members of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB) during a rally promoting religious tolerance at the National Monument (Monas) park on June 1. Munarman, leader of the Islam Troop Command (KLI), was allegedly involved directly in the attack, in which 70 people were injured. He has been charged with committing violence against people and objects. Reading out the charges against Rizieq, Nurlini, one of four prosecutors at the trial, said: ""He is guilty of instigating other people (his followers) to commit violence... as stated in the Criminal Code."" Rizieq's lawyers said their client did not have prior knowledge about the attack, and the evidence presented by the prosecutors was not convincing. ""They put some people on the eyewitness list, and these people never testified in court,"" defense lawyer Ary Yusuf Hamir said. He also objected to prosecutors' request for the judge to consider statements made during police interrogations of FPI members. The FPI members later withdrew their statements linking the attack to Rizieq. ""The prosecutors still want to use the statements, although they were withdrawn because they were made under pressure and force (from the police),"" Ary said. ""Only statements made in court can be used in the judgment."" The prosecutors urged the judge to consider the statements, saying police interrogators had testified in court that they did not put pressure on the FPI members to give false testimony. Judge Manusunan Harahap, who presided over the two hearings, adjourned the trial until Oct. 22 to give defense lawyers enough time to prepare for their rebuttal. Even if found guilty and sentenced to two years in prison, neither defendant will serve out the full term, having already served time since their detention in June.

"Sat, October 18 2008",Let's just practice what we preach,"One important aspect of being civilized and being regarded as part of civilization is having a moral value. Without a moral value, it is as if we have returned to the era of ancient life. It is also the basic principle of everyone's life. A moral value is considered the main part of education. It can be learned from the family, the smallest unit of education, and from formal education such as school. Having a moral value is believed to make this country better. Parents and teachers work together in teaching the children how to act in society based on a society's moral value. From a young age in the family to the highest level of education, we learn what is good and what is bad, what is accepted and what is not accepted by the society. This country and the people, including the government, are so proud of the moral value we have. The moral value our country is said to have is the combination of eastern culture and the traditional culture of our ancestors. It is said our moral value is to respect others and to have a great tolerance toward others. This is what we were taught in the family and at school. In the past, many students liked to fight each other. It was very common to hear students from one school fight with students from another school. No single day went by without hearing of and watching this kind of news. Hearing the news, everyone was so angry. Common people, such as parents, to people at the highest level commented on it. We thought that the school as an institution was the main problem. Teachers were said to be failing in teaching students the right way. All of the blame was put on the school, including the teachers and the lessons because they were not teaching the next generation our moral value. However, this time, the real problem in our moral value education which we were so proud of and afraid of at different times has been disclosed. This is a fact that nobody can deny. We teach our next generation to respect each other, but they see how adults attack other adults. This country is full of fighting and quarreling among different societies for many reasons. We tell our children to tolerate each other's differences, but they listen to how disrespectful adults speak of others. With many accusations, we blame and accuse others for what we think is untrue just because they have different beliefs or perceptions. For example, we tell our children -- in this holy month for our Muslim friends -- that fasting for them is a test of their patience. They should be patient when facing any circumstance. However, they see from television how members of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) -- who are adults -- are the other way. Those FPI members forbade food vendors from selling and destroyed their property in Tasikmalaya, West Java. They also attacked people inside and in front of the Central Jakarta Court during Ramadan. This example clearly shows the contrast between what we teach our children about the moral value of this country and how people act in their lives. This is the real threat for our next generation. If this threat is not stopped, we should not be surprised if one day our children at school also fight with other students from other schools. We have to be honest in saying that the main destroyer of the moral value of this country is us. We cannot be hypocrites anymore in front of our children. We have to start realizing our own mistakes. What we call a moral value now will just be a big lie if we do not change the way we live. We have to show our children the kind of life which is consistent with and not hypocritical to our lessons about our moral value. Then our country can continue being a civilized country.

"Thu, October 30 2008",Police reforms still needed,"Last month Bambang Hendarso Danuri replaced Sutanto as National Police (Polri) chief. Unfortunately during his appointment, there was a clash between members of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) and supporters of the Nationhood Alliance for Freedom of Faith and Belief (AKBPP) at the South Jakarta District Court. The clash is a strong indication that the police have not been professional and credible in performing their main tasks of maintaining security and order. Regardless of which side was guilty, a seriously wounded supporter of AKBPP was beaten and kicked by FPI members although he was under police escort. If the police were professional, they should have been prepared with an adequate number of anti-riot personnel in anticipation of such an incident before the court case where the FPI coordinator is standing trial as a suspect. The police apparently did not learn from Monas' violent incident in June which involved both sides. During a fit and proper test before the law commission of the House of Representatives here recently, Bambang, the only candidate, emphasized the need for accelerating the ongoing programs' sustainability, performance quality improvement and organizational commitment. He is committed to fighting gambling, drug abuse, terrorism, while-collar crime, illegal logging and illegal fishing, street crime, human trafficking and other social diseases. But the new police chief was apparently unaware of the department's real condition and capability. How will the police be able to improve not only their credibility but also their professionalism in the eyes of the public if their basic and main tasks cannot be performed well? Bambang urgently needs to honestly identify basic problems that are keeping the police from accomplishing their tasks well. We should no longer turn a blind eye to the problem and continue demanding them to ""live a sacred life"" while their daily basic needs are not met. One of Sutanto's several failures during his tenure was that he could not fight for his personnel's social welfare although the House had frequently reminded him to convince the President for a larger police budget because their salaries are only enough for ten days. Many police have to moonlight or end up abusing their power to seek additional income to support their family. The police cannot perform their major tasks and challenges unless the basic and main tasks of maintaining security and public order, monitoring the traffic and other public services are performed well. For humane reasons, it is impossible for police personnel to wholly dedicate their lives to their profession if their salaries cannot cover their daily basic needs and their family's. Bambang also needs to speed up internal consolidation and reform, including revamping organizational and training programs, in order to have qualified and professional personnel. Besides lacking qualified personnel, most of the current personnel are graduates of the old curriculum-based police academy and recruitment system when the National Police was an integral part of the then Indonesian Military during the New Order era. They are in dire need of regular training to reform their mind-set and characteristics in order to reinstate the National Police as civil servants and professional investigators. We do appreciate the new recruitment system and curriculum giving more opportunities to fresh university graduates to join the police academy but its fruits will not be realized for at least 10 to 20 years because besides taking time, the new recruits will not be directly appointed as field commanders. Indonesia needs professional police to maintain security, order and to enforce the law -- fundamental human and democratic rights the people have yet to obtain in their capacity as citizens and within a pluralist community. The police's main and basic tasks are not to issue driving licenses nor nab corrupters -- two jobs that can be handled by other institutions -- but to create a safe feeling in a pluralist society, make sure the rule of the law is applied and that all citizens are equal before the law. If the police stick to these minor but basic tasks, major cases and responsibilities will be entrusted to them. Traffic police in Britain are respected by motorists and travelers because they maintain the flow of traffic and their service is helpful. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States is known to be credible and accountable because its detectives are professional in thoroughly carrying out their investigations.

"Fri, October 31 2008",FPI members clash with police after Rizieq verdict,"BEHIND BARS: Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab leaves the Central Jakarta District Court in a police van after the court sentenced him to 18 months in prison on Thursday. ( JP/J. Adiguna) Hundreds of members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) clashed with police outside a Central Jakarta court and attempted to force the closure of a nearby Ahmadiyah mosque after their leader, Rizieq Shihab, was sentenced to 18 months in prison. The FPI members, stationed outside the Central Jakarta District Court, were outraged at the guilty verdict handed down to Rizieq for his role in instigating an attack on religious freedom activists at the National Monument park on June 1. After a shoving match with police officers securing the courthouse on Jl. Gajah Mada, the FPI members headed to the Al Hidayah mosque, run by the Ahmadiyah community, on Jl. Balikpapan, Gambir, to close it down. They were stopped 50 meters shy of the mosque by the police, leading to a scuffle between the two. It ended when the FPI members dispersed. No one was detained during the clash, but Central Jakarta Police deputy chief Heri Wibowo said there were elements inciting the crowd. Some 1,500 police officers had been deployed in anticipation of the hard-liners’ reaction to the verdict. Rizieq’s supporters inside the court were also outraged. Several shouted and swore at the judges, but were asked to restrain themselves by their leader. Rizieq’s wife and children were crying. Rizieq and his subordinate Munarman, commander of the Islam Troop Command, were both given 18-month sentences for their role in the attack on members of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion, rallying for the Ahmadiyah community after it had been declared heretical by the Indonesia Ulema Council (MUI). The presiding judge at both trials, Manusunan Harahap, said Rizieq had been proved guilty of instigating violence, and Munarman of committing violence. Both men protested the verdicts, claiming they were handed down based on dubious evidence. Both said they would appeal, and Rizieq maintained his calls for anti-Ahmadiyah actions. “Even if we risk breaking the law... even if I’m thrown in jail or die, we will never stop our efforts to disband Ahmadiyah,” Rizieq said after the sentence was read out. There was a visible sense of relief among police officers outside the courthouse after a police car carrying Munarman, whose sentencing followed Rizieq’s, left the compound. The officers had frequently been engaged by the FPI in clashes throughout the trial.

"Sun, November 2 2008",Guntur refuses to belong to the silent majority,"I hope (Rizieq Shihab, Islam Defenders Front leader) will think things through for himself during his jail term. I hope he will eventually be able to propagate an Islam that is anti-violence, Islam as the religion of blessings for the universe. This was a text message from activist Mohamad Guntur Romli, a defender of pluralism and a victim of the FPI violent ambush last June, sent minutes after the court passed the verdict on Rizieq on Thursday. The Jakarta District Court sentenced Rizieq to 18 months' imprisonment for inciting violence against a rally promoting religious tolerance in June this year. The sentence was too lenient in the eyes of the National Alliance for Freedom of Faith and Religion (AKKBB), the organization whose supporters were victims of the FPI's violent assault. Three weeks ago, AKKBB supporter Nong Darol Mahmada voiced her disappointment when prosecutors demanded two years' imprisonment, citing the physical and psychological damage FPI has caused to the public since its emergence in 1998. The FPI supporters brutally assaulted AKKBB supporters commemorating the birth of the Pancasila state pluralist ideology on June 1 at the National Monument (Monas), Central Jakarta. AKKBB was supporting the Ahmadiyah sect that was under fire for being considered blasphemous in relation to Islam. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono condemned the assault, immediately stating that Indonesia was a lawful state, not an anarchic state. We should not be defeated by violent actions, he said. But it was clear the state failed to protect its citizens that Sunday afternoon, with the FPI taking action in the absence of security personnel. Seventy AKKBB members were injured. The FPI thugs also brutally attacked women and children. ""After I was sure my family was safe. I returned to the crowd to try and guard some of the women and children. It was then that I was brutally beaten,"" said Mohamad Guntur Romli, known as Guntur. Guntur came to the Monas park along with his two sisters and two young nieces. Other AKKBB activists -- including Wahid Institute for pluralism director Ahmad Suaedy and researcher Imadun Rahmat -- were accompanied by their wives and children. ""It was a peaceful rally. Some of us planned to have a family gatherings afterwards. I planned to entertain my nieces with a ride around Monas in a (horse-drawn) buggy after the rally. My sisters had prepared our meals,"" Guntur said. ""Therefore, we were not prepared when the FPI attacked us."" FPI members beat Guntur with sticks. Guntur underwent a three-hour operation at the Army Central Hospital in Central Jakarta for his fractured nose and cheek bones caused by the blows. Rizieq and the FPI were just doing a job in the field for others,"" said Guntur, who works for various institutions including Jurnal Perempuan Foundation for women's issues, Komunitas Utan Kayuy cultural center and Radio KBR6811. People like FPI members do not care that Islam is tarnished by their violent deeds. Dirty politicians will use any unethical means to reach their goals."" FPI made its first public appearance in August 1998. The organization staged a massive demonstration challenging those who rejected the presidency of B.J. Habibie (1998-1999). Rizieq, said to be a Hadrami descendant born into a family of sayyids who claimed to be direct descendants of the Prophet, founded the FPI. According to scholar Noorhaidi Hasan in his Ph.D. thesis, Rizieq was a religious preacher and teacher at a Jamiatul Khair Hadrami Islamic school in Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta. The area is known as one of the most important centers of sayyid influence. The nearby Kwitang Mosque serves as the ""political center"" of sayyids , to which powerful figures associated with the New Order have affiliated themselves. Noorhaidi's thesis states that the militant group was loosely organized with open membership. Most members came from mosque youth organizations and Islamic schools ( madrasas ). Other members were simply unemployed youngsters who joined because FPI promised payments for each action. FPI became the most active group to conduct raids on public places alleged to be centers of vice. Armed with sticks, members repeatedly attacked cafes, discotheques, casinos and brothels without facing any significant challenge from security personnel. ""On one occasion,"" Noorhaidi writes, ""They attacked the National Commission of Human Rights, which was condemned for acting unfairly toward Muslims and favoring Christians. ""At the time, the commission was investigating the past actions of certain army generals, particularly the then defense minister Wiranto, who was suspected of violating human rights during military operations in Timor Leste."" Wiranto is now a presidential candidate. Last Monday, Guntur told The Jakarta Post that Islam is misused by dirty politicians as a way to reach their political goals. On Jihad The book written by Guntur -- Ustadz, Saya Sudah di Surga (Ustadz, I am in Heaven Already), which was published in 2007 -- and the five books he co-authored, expressed his concerns on Islamic issues. Guntur believes jihad (sometimes thought only to mean holy war but actualy applicable to any moral quest in Islam) is often misused by hard-liners like FPI. ""If we read the Koran critically, we find that jihad is not identical to war. Koran has two terms that are often regarded to have the same meaning, namely jihad , which means 'struggle' in the general sense, and qital , which means 'war'. ""The jihad verses were revealed in the Mecca era, a period when there were no wars (against Islam). The qital verses were revealed in the Medina era (after the Prophet Muhammad migrated to Medina in AD 622), an era charactarized by wars. ""So there was a license for war when the term qital was used, not jihad ."" ""When the jihad verses were revealed in Medina, then the meaning was bound to the context of war in Medina. Misinterpretation arises when contemporary Muslims do not separate the meaning of jihad and qital . Qital is indeed one form of jihad ,"" Guntur said. He said he was aware that hadiths (authenticated sayings) of the Prophet being promoted today were those from the Medina period. Within them, there are also hadiths about jihad , ""So it is understandable if the meaning of jihad is identical with wars"". However, Guntur said, ""We should struggle against the interpretation that 'locks' the meaning of jihad to merely mean war. ""War is a defensive mechanism, not a form of brutality. War was waged during the Rasulullah era to defend religious freedom, which was blocked by military power. Present-day terrorists use the term jihad to attack religious freedom and to spread hatred (against others),"" Guntur said. Silent Majority Guntur is against those tarnishing his religion. His spirit did not die with the physical attack. He appeared on local TV after the FPI assault, voicing his protests against the ""thugs in robes"" from his hospital bed. ""My suffering did not end in the hospital. I was beaten in the courtroom when I appeared as a witness against the FPI militia, before the panel of judges. ""The court also did nothing when Rizieq cried out against a police witness,""Guntur said. Guntur's friends endured similar fates in the courtroom. Nong Darol Mahmada was sexually harassed, and AKKBB supporter Isti was beaten. ""I am still optimistic about the future of religious pluralism in Indonesia despite the absence of legal and political certainty and even though the Muslim majority is keeping silent,"" Guntur said. ""My optimism comes from my faith that only religious pluralism will humanize human beings.""",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/11/02/guntur-refuses-belong-silent-majority.html,,2008
"Tue, November 4 2008",SMS: Sentence for Rizieq Shihab,"Your comments on the 18-month jail term for chairman of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) Rizieq Shihab for his role in the violence during a peace rally in Jakarta in June. 18 months can't stop him from pursuing his noble goals, regulations of Islamic law certainly are not negotiable. The Religious Affairs Ministry does not function well! LISMA Bekasi I think the sentence is not enough compared to his actions because years ago he was in jail for another crime. Assault and violence are forbidden in Islam. So, Rizieq should have gotten a three-year jail sentence. AKBAR Jakarta It is about time that justice was enforced. They should lock him up longer! FARAH Jakarta I agree with the sentence against him because members of his organizations are allowed to carry out violence. PIPIT PUSPITASARI Metro, Lampung Islam is the only religion recognized by God and never condones violence. Its image is tarnished by the straying minds of its followers. I suggest the government disband his organization. BONNA Jakarta I think 18 months is nothing compare to the losses (physically and mentally) for the victims. Especially for a mastermind such as Rizieq Shihab -- 18 years, now that would teach a lesson for future terrorist not to mess around in Indonesia. CHANDRA Jakarta Violence confronted by violence just brings about new violence. We never take away lessons from this. Now we are an angry nation. DWIYANTO Blora, Central Java The verdict is right.

JOEL TEDJA Jakarta Only through proper education can we see that religion is an individual matter, if not personal in nature. It should not in anyway jeopardize Pancasila state ideology and the unity of our nation. Imposing it upon another is tantamount to trespassing upon the freedom of another. MOELJONO ADIKOESSOEMO Jakarta FPI leader Rizieq Shihab was sentenced because of violence by his supporters in June. The way his supporters express their ideas is not acceptable; also, they argue that they took over the role of the state which did not carry out its duty. He doesn't also live in a country that is based on any religion, but a country that is based on the various values of humanity. For example, the system in Holland is different from the system in Iran. We in Indonesia have our own system, so no citizens can force their own wishes on others. There is ""no state within the state"". Every action against the existing laws will have consequences. We know there are many interests in the country, so only the certainty of law can keep the country at peace. YOGI SUWASONO Jakarta It is too lenient. He should have been sentenced to 15 years to deter other hard-liners from taking the law into their own hands. MURTHY Jakarta About the leader of FPI, that is his risk to receive 18-month sentence. As a Muslim and the leader, he should set a good example for people. Protest must not be conveyed through violence and I also call on the government to be fair to someone who is breaking the law. YURLENI LUBIS Bekasi, West Java I congratulate the court on Rizieq's guilty verdict and, given the actions of the FPI members during and after the trial, it is well justified. The law is the law and his comment about breaking it to achieve FPI's ends just proves his and the FPI's narrow-mindedness and commitment to violence. Pity he only got 18 months.

"Mon, November 24 2008",Jakarta courts yet to learn from lax security,"The Central Jakarta District Court has tightened security following a death resulting from courtroom violence, but other courts have yet to follow suit. The atmosphere at the district court was calm on a weekday last week, with visitors waiting patiently to attend one of the five hearings scheduled for the day. The passivity may have been an effect of the presence of the new court officers stationed throughout the building in their blue shirts and uniforms. They were posted there to prevent a recurrence of the violence last month that lead to the murder of Stanley Mukuah, who was stabbed to death with a flagpole while attending a murder trial. ""We replaced the previous security officers -- borrowed from the department of justice. We returned them and hired (guards) from an external security company to do it. They are now stationed at the court 24 hours a day,"" Sugeng Riyono, a justice who is also the court's spokesman, told The Jakarta Post . ""This place is densely crowded. Moreover, in a court building, conflict is bound to arise. There is no way for us to know if a person has bad intentions. So (we took the measure) to prevent the same incident from happening again,"" he said. That also includes stationing plain-clothes officers in the compound. Sulistya, a first time visitor, said she was pleased with the security measures. ""I read about the killing in a newspaper, so I was quite worried. I thought the court was a dangerous place. But coming here myself, I found it surprisingly quiet and orderly,"" said the woman in her 20s. Violence in courts is rare, but in incidences where it has occurred, preventative measures have been found wanting. The murder of Stanley was the bloodiest court room conflict this year, but there had been warnings such a tragedy could occur. During the high-profile trial of Islamic Defender Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab, in which there was a high level of security, a witness was almost set upon in the courtroom by a number of FPI supporters. Each side said the other had provoked the incident. The same court played host to a bizarre spectacle in 2003, when military officers in uniforms attended a session sporting knives and guns. According to the Criminal Law Procedures Code, guns and sharp objects are forbidden in court. Police officers guarding courtrooms are also forbidden to carry weapons. At the time, metal detectors at the court were rarely used. Even now, the newly stationed officers claim checking visitors is troublesome. ""Anyone who passes the gate should register and leave their identity card at the booth, but many refuse. Lawyers are especially hard to stop, they ignore us,"" said Sutrisno, one of the outsourceed officers. He said the security team had reverted to selecting individuals for spot checks based on their suspicions. ""Some are familiar because they are around very often. Some look like they are going to the mosque at the back so we let them off. We only check people who are unfamiliar,"" he said. During the fifteen minute interview, more than 20 people passed through the gate unchecked. Two women said they had been checked twice in the day. Court visitors are not provided with identity cards, meaning it is difficult for security guards to know if visitors have already been checked. Security officers at other courts in Jakarta must search attendees without scanners. At the West Jakarta District Court, security officers stationed at the main entrance judged visitors by eye with assistance from three police officers. ""We only use the door for special court sessions when we think there may be a large crowd involved,"" said Abdul Kodir, a security coordinator who has worked at the court for 10 years, on Tuesday. ""On normal days, we only observe visitors and approach suspicious people to ask them what they are doing here. ""People are not here to cause trouble."" The court was trying more than 100 people that day, he said, adding that more than 300 visitors had attended the sessions. In June 2004, Walterus Refra, brother of gang leader John Kei, was killed in front of the West Jakarta District Court following a trial session of a brawl involving Kei's and Sangaji's gangs that had occurred two months prior. The South Jakarta District Court has also seen its share of violence. In March 2005, hundreds of members of Kei's and Sangaji's gangs attended a trial of the murder of Basri Sangaji, the leader of Sangaji's gang. The 600 police officers deployed to defuse the situation confiscated around 30 various kinds of sharp objects from the involved gang members. Although the court has a metal detector, it is only used for court hearings expected to draw large or angry crowds. ""The degree of risk is usually implied by the type of case. The prosecutors will also inform us if the case to be tried requires special care. In such a case, we would work with the nearby police station to deploy more people,"" South Jakarta District Court spokesperson Soeharto said. Most of the time, he said, they depended on the good behavior of the visitors. ""If there are signs of a potential conflict, we will tell the visitors that the officials there are not their enemies. Lawyers are acting in the interests of their clients, prosecutors of the charges, and the court is just a place to hold the hearing,"" he said. The security officers' nonchalant attitude has left many pondering where and when the next tragedy will occur. Arifin Daulay, a lawyer present at the West Jakarta District Court, said he wondered why there needed to be incidents for the officials to take serious preventative measures. Sugeng said other courts would have to follow in the Central Jakarta District Court's footsteps. ""The impact of that incidence has been nationwide. So there will be a standard (of procedures) in the future. Not only in this courthouse,"" he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/11/24/jakarta-courts-yet-learn-lax-security.html,,2008
"Wed, November 26 2008","Most Islamic studies teachers oppose pluralism, survey finds","Most Islamic studies teachers in public and private schools in Java oppose pluralism, tending toward radicalism and conservatism, according to a survey released in Jakarta on Tuesday. The study shows 62.4 percent of the surveyed Islamic teachers, including those from Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah — the country’s two largest Muslim organizations — reject the notion of having non-Muslim leaders. The survey was conducted last month by the Center for Islamic and Society Studies (PPIM) at Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University in Jakarta, involving some 500 Islamic studies teachers throughout Java. It reveals 68.6 percent of the respondents are opposed to non-Muslims becoming their school principle and 33.8 percent are opposed to having non-Muslim teachers at their schools. Some 73.1 percent of the teachers don’t want followers of other religions to build their houses of worship in their neighborhoods, it found. Some 85.6 percent of the teachers prohibit their students from celebrating big events perceived as Western traditions, while 87 percent tell their students not to learn about other religions. Some 48 percent of the teachers would prefer for female and male students to be separated into different classrooms. PPIM director Jajat Burhanudin said the teachers’ anti-pluralist views would be reflected in their lessons and contribute to growing conservatism and radicalism among Muslims in the country. “I think they play a key role in promoting conservatism and radicalism among Muslims nowadays. You can’t say now that conservatism and radicalism only develop on the streets like what has been campaigned by the FPI (the Islam Defenders Front), but rather deep within the education (system),” he said, referring to a radical Islamic group. Jajat said such intolerance threatened the civil and political rights of citizens of other religions. The survey also shows 75.4 percent of the respondents ask their students to call on non-Muslim teachers to convert to Islam, while 61.1 percent reject a new Islamic sect. In line with their strict beliefs, 67.4 percent said they felt more Muslim than Indonesian. The majority of the respondents also support the adoption of sharia law in the country to help fight crime. According to the survey, 58.9 percent of the respondents back rajam (stoning) as a punishment for all kinds of criminal and 47.5 percent said the punishment for theft should be having one hand cut off, while 21.3 percent want the death sentence for those who convert from Islam. Only 3 percent of the teachers said they felt it was their duty to produce tolerant students. With 44.9 percent of the respondents claiming themselves members of Nahdlatul Ulama and 23.8 percent supporters of Muhammadiyah, Jajat said the two moderate organizations had failed to establish their values at the grassroots. “Moderation and pluralism are only embraced by their elites. I am afraid that this kind of phenomenon has contributed to increasing radicalism and even terrorism in our country,” he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/11/26/most-islamic-studies-teachers-oppose-pluralism-survey-finds.html,,2008
"Fri, December 5 2008",Violent jihadism boasts a new face,"Based on online and TV news in Indonesia, Jihadists have been successful in shaping the ""positive"" image of their activism. Attacks conducted over the last decade are portrayed as the attempt to struggle against the pressure of the West and ruling governments, which they call thaghut , a term allowing them to fight under the name of God. Before the execution of the Bali bombers, Abu Bakar Ba'asyir, the spiritual leader of Jamaah Islamiyah (JI), and now the leader of Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid (JAT), delivered a message on the status of the bombers on the Internet through YouTube. Ba'asyir argues that the three bombers are eligible for the highest reward from God for their actions, which Ba'asyir claims was jihad. Ba'asyir is not the only jihadi leader using cyber facilities to deliver propaganda. Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab Al Zarqawi and Aiman Al Zawahiri of al-Qaeda have used cyberspace to propagate their programs and messages. In Indonesia, blogging is also used by radical, violent communities to promote their ideas of jihad. Cyberspace and print media were also effective instruments for the Bali bombers, turning them into very popular and ""inspiring pioneers"" among radical Muslims. Before their execution on Nov. 9, 2008, the Bali bombers became celebrities, enjoying publicity through the Indonesian and international media. Some interviews by radical print magazines, such as Jihadmagz and Sabili , constructed a positive image, with more Indonesian Muslims sympathizing with them before publication. No wonder, the bombers' funerals were attended by more than 2,000 visitors from all parts of Java and some other Indonesian regions. They were visitors from Afghan veterans, radical organization members, Jihadist school students and the bombers' neighbors in Lamongan, East Java, and Serang, Banten. The silent majority of moderate Muslims will lose their space preserving plurality and tolerance in the long term if they do not take more action to fight against radical jihadism. Democracy and freedom enjoyed by all Indonesians after the collapse of the New Order will turn into a nightmare if the government and the majority of moderate Muslims do not solve the problem immediately. Fawaz A. Gerges ( 2005 ), the chair of International Affairs and Middle Eastern Studies at Sarah Lawrence College, argues that radical jihadist intend to combat the ""far enemy"" as part of their global Jihad. The war, therefore, is between the solidarity of Muslims in Southern Philippines, Southern Thailand, Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestine against the West. But later they will shift their fight to the ""near enemy"". According to interviews and statements by Bali trio and other jihadi leaders showing, they will fight against the near enemy, Muslims in Indonesia, who are against their agenda. Now is the period of their consolidation. They are strengthening their ideology and recruiting more people under the umbrella of radical organizations. The quality of support has more meaning than the numbers. According to the survey of LSI ( 2007 ), the number of JI, Indonesian Mujahiddin Council (MMI) and FPI supports increased significantly between 2005 and 2007. In rural and urban Indonesia, more Muslims have changed their minds, sympathizing with the ideologies and struggle of radical communities. The ongoing financial crisis and the chronic disease of corruption have become effective ways to attract people the caravan of jihad and radical groups. The Nobel laureate Amartya Sen ( 2007 ) argues that the existence of radical jihadists and their struggle is part of expressing identity and the richness of Muslims. More needs to be done to counter terrorism than just imprisoning criminals. Interfaith and multicultural dialogue as well as the global agenda to decrease poverty have to be proponents of policies throughout the world. It will be a more powerful way to finish building the image of peace for the world against the attempt of violent, radical groups.

"Sat, December 6 2008",Forum: The worst to come,"So we must brace ourselves for this global crisis. By the way, we have gotten used to this chronic economic crisis. It's like the chronic flood that happens in Jakarta, in five-year cycles. But now the flood comes nearly yearly. After the flood, the next day will be sunny! After the crisis, another expansion will come and healthy growth will return. Mexico was hit by a crisis in 1994. The peso had to be devalued by 50 percent which led to capital outflows. Then Mexico tried to maintain parity by raising interest rates. Likewise in Asia in 1997, many foreign investors decided to pull out of the countries affected altogether. However, the depreciation also led to a boom in exports and a later boom in output. Crises will always come and go, like typhoons, which is bad and good news. SIDHARTTA Jakarta I think Minister Sri Mulyani is too optimistic because she hopes the entire state budget will go to infrastructure development, which will help Indonesian economic development stay on track. She thinks state spending also will improve and enable Indonesians to use their money to buy products originally meant for export. All this means she wants to change Indonesia's market orientation, from export to domestic sales. But the problem is our middle-to-lower-class people, who are still the majority in Indonesia, do not have enough money to buy those products. They still use most of their salary for food, to pay their children's school fees and health costs. Unfortunately our middle and upper classes number only a few; most of our conglomerate or rich people who owned shares in the stock market have seen the value of their stake decrease dramatically. So it will be hard for Indonesia to keep its economic development above a level of 4 percent next year. I think 2-3 percent is good enough. MUHAMMAD JUSUF Denpasar The government's decision to spend Rp 120 trillion (US$10 billion) in a month is almost impossible! For example, the bureaucracy involved in auctions is usually not as simple as those ""think tanks"" think. And no wonder if the target Rp 120 trillion will be missed. Facing a fundamental breakdown needs a fundamental cure (not an instant move like this). Even the government has said it will spend on an infrastructure program; moving in a hurry such as this only means operational units do not work effectively. BAS Jakarta You don't know that in the pedestrian sector, the economy is still running well, so I don't think the crisis will become worse as we all predicted. The most important thing is that the election of the president must take place successfully and our politics are stable. This will be good for all people. NAHRAWI Jakarta Editorial: Safe sex, please -- Dec. 2, p. 6 Indonesia is probably the first to propose microchip implants for HIV/AIDS individuals. Very groundbreaking. Congratulations. I have a creeping feeling that this bill will pass and the public's voice will remain unheard. If it passes, we will officially be the stupidest country in the southeast (I mean, our Human Development Index is already below war-torn Palestine, we might as well go all the way). This microchip proposal created by the brilliant minds of legislators make the fatwas from MUI look like a joke. I read elsewhere that the microchips will be implanted into those who are ""sexually aggressive"". However, the legislators have failed to define who exactly and what number of the population are ""sexually aggressive"". Apparently they will form a council that will collectively determine who needs to be monitored. If these dimwits think that by monitoring, putting the infected in jail and imposing a $5,000 fine, AIDS will disappear, then we are in need of more investment in education than we think. IYUEN Jakarta The only solution to combat HIV/AIDS is not to promote safer sex but to discourage out-of-wedlock sex and premarital sex. Authorities should encourage those who are married to have better sex with their spouse. If you encourage safer sex among your citizens, there is no guarantee that they won't contract HIV/AIDS because condoms are not 100 percent safe. In addition to that, it is also sinful to promote what is already sinful. Abstinence should be encouraged among those who are not married. In this case, I see that it is the government that fails to take control of the situation. The government should also educate the young about HIV/AIDS through public education. Yes, it is true that God would not create a problem if there wasn't any solution. And God wouldn't create AIDS if there wasn't any cure. The only cure here is to avoid adultery. KING CRIPPLER Singapore I liked the comment from King Crippler. Abstinence from sex until married and fidelity to your spouse in marriage is a 100 percent safe method of staying free of HIV/AIDS and other sexual infectious diseases. But sadly, not all will abide by this doctrine, and it is to their detriment. I also agree that it's an ""investment"" by the government for a healthy populous to promote abstinence and/or safe sex practices. Education and morality are the best defenses against HIV/AIDS. PAUL LEWIS Jakarta Visit Indonesia Year 2009 -- Nov. 28, p. 13 It makes me sad to see opportunities to profit from tourism being squandered. There is so much potential for sustainable travel and tourism in Indonesia which could bring much-needed income to some of the poorest inhabitants of the archipelago. I'm glad to see an increase in marketing but, as others have said, this will come to nought unless national and local governments can take a long-term view and not be content with filling their pockets just for today. Malaysia allocates a poor fraction of its resources for tourism as does Indonesia, yet that country is earning more in tourism revenue this year. How can this be? It isn't just clever marketing; it means providing visitors with a welcoming environment where they have lots of opportunities to spend their money on quality products and services. We make tourists pay to come in; they face extortion by everyone from airport officials to taxi drivers, and then they find that products they can buy anywhere else in Southeast Asia are overpriced and, in the case of spirits, virtually unobtainable. Add to that the images of convicted terrorists being treated like celebrities and the impunity with which groups like the FPI can act and it is no surprise that Visit Indonesia 2008 didn't work. Wake up and smell the coffee! DAVID Jakarta So is this the confirmation that the government plans to throw out the porn law, fix the ludicrous alcohol situation (and cut duty on it to bring it into line with successful tourist destinations like Malaysia and Singapore), allow imported foods, insist that police don't extort money from tourists, overhaul the VOA program which penalizes people for wanting to spend money here, and bring the airports up to a vaguely modern standard. Because those are all reasons why people won't come here, beyond the terror threat. It's not hard but nobody seems able to work it out. Indonesia could easily achieve 20 million tourists a year, adding huge amounts to the nation's coffers, if it was smart but it seems not. ALAN Jakarta Oh 2008 did not work -- let's try 2009. Just proves that this country is lacking in many ways (too bad because Indonesia is a great place, although a lot of work needs to be done if they want to compete with Singapore or Malaysia). Terrorism does not help the situation: A lot of people are scared to travel in Indonesia. STEVE Ottawa Have a look at the new TV commercial advertising Jakarta as a tourism destination and you will see why tourism is dropping.

"Mon, December 22 2008","Time for SBY, JK to gain voters' trust","The final year of a term can be the toughest time for incumbents. This is when they have to hurry along their programs to make a success of their term in office and convince people to vote for them again in the next election. Yet the final year can also be politically advantageous for incumbents because they can use their position to campaign for reelection and undertake popular activities -- sometimes labeled ""state programs"" -- to improve their image. For President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his deputy Jusuf Kalla -- whose five-year term will end in October next year -- the final year means reinvigorating public trust, as their popularity has shown signs of waning during their four years in office. Both Yudhoyono and Kalla have been trying to focus on their state duties during this final year, while sparing time for activities with their respective political parties. Yudhoyono is chief patron of the Democratic Party and Kalla chairs Golkar, the nation's largest party. They have moved separately to consolidate support for their own parties to win the 2009 legislative and presidential elections. This final year for Yudhoyono is the time for people to scrutinize the performance of his administration and determine whether to give him another go next year. Yudhoyono has confirmed his intention to run for a second term in next year's presidential election on the Democratic Party ticket. He has also hinted at keeping Kalla on as his running mate. Kalla warmly welcomed the President's apparent offer, saying he had been ""very content to work with Yudhoyono during these four years"". At the same time, Kalla made it clear that his plans for 2009 would depend entirely on Golkar's internal decisions. Although several opinion polls have suggested that the Yudhoyono-Kalla duo has a good chance at being elected next year, Golkar leaders are divided into two camps over this issue. One camp wishes to nominate one of its members -- possibly Kalla -- as a presidential candidate, with the other happy to support Kalla as vice president for a second term. Those wanting to nominate Kalla as president are optimistic that Golkar could win the 2009 legislative election with 30 percent of votes. On the other hand, the other thing the Democratic Party and Golkar have to consider with their coalition is that Yudhoyono and Kalla seem to have the ""chemistry"" to run the country, despite frequent reports of disputes between the two. Some analysts say the dwindling popularity of Yudhoyono and Kalla will make it harder for them to win the 2009 presidential election than it was in 2004. They said the current political momentum is now getting behind Yudhoyono's rivals, whom many view as viable alternative candidates offering promises of changes. His rivals will always be able to point to weaknesses in the Yudhoyono administration. They have more room to launch political maneuvers than the incumbent does, who has to be held accountable for the consequences of the policies he made. The two issues most often used in attacks by Yudhoyono's political opponents tend to be poverty and unemployment. In pursuit of his political interests in the lead-up to the 2009 election, Yudhoyono has also made these two issues into a strategy to woo voters. In his state of the nation address on Independence Day this year, the President claimed credit for his administration's success in decreasing the poverty and unemployment rates, and pledged to prioritize programs to enhance people's well-being during the remainder of his term. He said poverty had reached its lowest level in a decade, from 17.7 percent in 2006 to 15.4 percent as of February this year, while the unemployment rate had decreased from 10.5 percent in 2006 to its current level of 8.5 percent. However, some economists and his critics have questioned this declining poverty rate, accusing the Yudhoyono government of manipulating the figures. In terms of anti-poverty policies, the government launched three schemes: providing direct cash assistance for the poor, community empowerment funding and loans for small and medium enterprises. Amid his efforts to boost his popularity ahead of the election, Yudhoyono might have to work harder to counter the looming impacts of the global financial crisis on Indonesia, which were expected to worsen in the first half of 2009. Corruption is another area where Yudhoyono pledged to make a difference, but he has earned a mix of praise and criticism from the public over the government's fight against graft. He was lauded recently for his move to allow Aulia Pohan, his son's father-in-law, to be detained by the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) as a suspect in a major graft scandal involving Bank Indonesia (BI). Aulia's implication in the case proved a test for Yudhoyono in proving that the President would ensure all corruption suspects would received equal treatment. An opinion poll released last month showed that Yudhoyono's move to keep out of the Aulia case gave him a surge in public support. Tribute was also paid to Yudhoyono when he bowed to public pressure to remove justice minister Hamid Awaluddin and state secretary Yusril Ihza Mahendra from his Cabinet in May last year. The two were fired amid controversy over their efforts to help a Bahamas-based company, partly owned by Hutomo ""Tommy"" Mandala Putra, the imprisoned son of former president Soeharto, reclaim money from BNP Paribas. But the President has come under strong criticism for keeping on two current Cabinet members -- State Minister for National Development Planning Paskah Suzetta and Forestry Minister Malam Sambat Kaban -- despite the two being implicated in several major graft cases, including the BI scandal. Paskah and Kaban have both been questioned by the KPK several times but have not been charged. Nevertheless, their implication in the corruption cases has tainted the image of Yudhoyono's Cabinet. Yudhoyono's commitment to pluralism has similarly come under public scrutiny. He did not intervene to stop the issuance of a joint ministerial decree banning the nonviolent Jamaah Ahmadiyah sect from spreading its religious teachings. The President did condemn a brutal attack on pro-pluralism activists from the Alliance for the Freedom and Faith of Religion by followers of the radical Islam Defenders Front (FPI), and ordered an investigation into the incident. But Yudhoyono failed to take more stringent measures to combat radicalization in the predominantly Muslim nation and to ensure similar FPI attacks on other groups would stop. The most controversial issue, which the President should have addressed, was the pornography law passed earlier this year by the House of Representatives. Yudhoyono signed the bill into law recently, defying protests from several provinces, moderate groups, human rights organizations and artists. The pornography law and Ahmadiyah, as well as the power of hard-line groups, are sensitive issues for most Muslim voters -- issues Yudhoyono and many other leading politicians would prefer to steer clear of. The President's reticence over such sensitive religious issues could earn him more political credit from Muslim voters, believed to be mainly conservative. After all, one thing for sure is that, should Yudhoyono fail to meet public expectations during this final year, there are plenty of other gritty presidential hopefuls keen to step into his shoes in 2009.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/12/22/time-sby-jk-gain-voters039-trust.html,,2008
"Sat, January 3 2009","Protesters out in force to lambast Israel, U.S.","Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of cities across the country on Friday to denounce Israeli air strikes on Gaza that have killed 425 people in the past six days. The protesters accused the United States of supporting the attacks, raising strong and renewed anti-American sentiment among Indonesian Muslims. Muslim scholars and observers have warned of a rise in radicalism and retaliation against Western targets over the air strikes, after the United States and its Western allies failed to condemn them. The protesters stopped short of slamming Hamas, which Israel and some Western countries accuse of having provoked the attacks. In the capital, about 100,000 protesters hit the streets in downtown Jakarta. The demonstrators, mobilized by the Islamic-based Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), marched on the U.S. Embassy on Jl. Medan Merdeka Selatan, Central Jakarta, from the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle. ""As of today, every Islamic element in the country and the world must stand together to fight Israel and their American allies,"" PKS president Tifatul Sembiring told the applauding crowd gathered outside the embassy compound. ""I also demand that U.S. president-elect Barack Obama fulfill his slogan, *Change We Can Believe In'. Obama must not support Israel as the Bush administration does."" The protesters, carrying anti-Israeli and U.S. banners and yelling "" Allahu Akbar "" (God is great), came from Jakarta and PKS branches in Bandung, Depok, Bekasi, Bogor and Banten. Fadli Amirulah, 27, came from Bandung, bringing with him some 1,000 protesters to show their support for peace in Gaza and for the Palestinians' struggle against Israel. He and fellow protesters urged young people to start boycotting U.S. and Western products. ""We have data that shows some of the profits made by companies such as McDonald's and Coca-Cola are allocated to the Zionists. We must stop using their products to cut their funding,"" he said. In Bandung, hundreds of members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and United Islam (Persis) staged an anti-Israeli rally in the city center, condemning the attacks and burning pictures of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and U.S. President George W. Bush. Twenty-two Muslims, including four women, have registered with the FPI to fight against Israel in Gaza. ""I saw on TV how cruel Israel was. I couldn't stand to watch children being killed. So I joined as a jihadi to prepare to die,"" said Herlina, 43, a mother of one. A similar rally was also held in Malang, East Java, involving thousands of members of the PKS, the National Mandate Party (PAN), Muhammadiyah, Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) and the Indonesian Islamic Youth. In Medan, North Sumatra, 95 people have volunteered to be sent to Gaza to fight Israel. ""We plan to send 100 people to Gaza in the first stage. Now we only need five more people to begin sending people there,"" said Indra Suheri, the FPI's North Sumatra FPI secretary. Large protests also took place in Ternate, North Maluku, and Banda Aceh, Aceh province.

"Mon, January 5 2009",TNI prepares troops for Gaza,"The Indonesian Military (TNI) is ready to send troops to bloody Gaza should the United Nations request Indonesia to join a peace mission to the besieged area. TNI spokesman Rear Marshall Sagom Tamboen told The Jakarta Post on Saturday that if the Indonesian government, in response to a UN request, decided to send troops to join a peace mission, then the military would readily answer to the call. ""If the UN does ask us to join a peace mission in Palestine, we will certainly send our troops there. However, we are now still waiting for the UN's request,"" he said. According to Sagom, Indonesia's military mission to Lebanon in the past few years was based on the UN's Security Council resolution to send a peace mission to the Middle East country. ""Indonesia's regulation doesn't allow us to send troops to a foreign country, unless if it is a political decision of the government. The government will not decide on sending troops unless it is requested by the UN,"" he explained. Sagom was responding to a demand from Islamic organizations in the country, urging the government to send troops to Gaza to help end Israeli strikes over the area and save the lives of Palestineans. Among the organizations are Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), Islam Troop Command and Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI). While FPI is mobilizing jihadis (volunteers) to depart to Gaza and fight the Israeli troops, HTI said it would not send any volunteers to the badly-damaged area. ""Hizbut Tahrir is not calling for the sending of volunteers to Palestine. We are calling for the sending of military troops. Volunteers can never fight and defeat Israel,"" HTI chairman Farid Wajdi said as quoted by kompas.com in a discussion here Saturday. Farid added Israel had too strong a backing so that it was not an equal match for volunteers. He also said Indonesia should not wait for the UN's request to join a peace mission, accusing the international body of being too weak and of being under the United States control. AFP earlier reported that the UN Security Council emergency meeting in New York on New Year's Eve failed to produce a decision after ambassadors from the United States and Britain rejected the Libyan draft resolution condemning Israel's military action and calling for an immediate cease fire. The draft resolution ""strongly condemns all military attacks and the excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force by Israel, the occupying power, which have led to the death and injury of scores of innocent Palestinian civilians, including women and children."" The two ambassadors said the draft needed to be amended before possible adoption because it failed to mention the Hamas rocket attacks on Israel, which they claimed had triggered the Israeli strikes.

"Wed, January 7 2009",Jihadists the last thing Gaza needs: Minister,"The government maintained Tuesday its stance of refusing to send Indonesian troops to the Gaza Strip despite mounting pressure from some Islamic groups to dispatch jihadists to the besieged Middle Eastern spot. The Foreign Ministry said sending jihadists to Gaza to help Hamas fight Israel would not improve the situation, adding there were much more effective avenues Indonesia could take to help diffuse the situation. A number of Islamic hardline groups, including the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), have said they wish to send volunteers to Gaza under the banner of jihad and have called on the government to support them. “Is conducting a jihad effective? We must ask Gaza if that’s what they need, and most probably they (don’t). There are other more effective ways to help ... So far, sending jihadists isn’t an option,” Foreign Minister Hassan Wirayuda said. AFP reported Tuesday that the 11-day-old Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip had claimed the lives of at least 635 Palestinians and wounded 2,900 more. The toll shot up Tuesday when Israeli fire hit three schools, killing at least 45 people. Speaking in his annual statement to the press, Hassan said what Gaza needed most was medicine and medical assistance. “We are looking at the possibility of sending medical workers to field hospitals in the Egypt area of Sinai, which borders with Gaza. We’re awaiting clearance from Egypt, and the President has instructed the health minister to collect volunteers,” Hassan said. Despite agreeing that the Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip had nothing to do with religion, Islamic groups in Jakarta have hyped up the conflict between the two religious groups, paving the way for the Islamic-based Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) and other Islamic groups to seize the momentum ahead of the April elections. Observers on Tuesday criticized nationalist parties for not shouting down calls by Islam groups to send volunteers to the war, which was defined by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Monday as a clash over the sovereignty of territory between Palestine and Israel, and not a religious matter. “The nationalist groups should be more active in voicing their stance as Indonesia’s voice will be much more strong if the (the world) considers it to represent a pluralist Indonesia rather than only Islam,” University of Indonesia international relations expert Hariyadi Wirawan said. He said a pluralist Indonesia would attract more sympathy from major non-Muslim countries, such as members of the European Union (EU), as well as powerful human rights groups world wide that see the attacks as a territory dispute and a human rights tragedy rather than an attack against Islam. PKS, the FPI and HTI seized the spotlight immediately after Israeli began the attacks when the groups gathered thousands of supporters in Jakarta and other big cities in the country to rally against Israel and the US. Other political parties and nationalist groups did not take part in the rallies, and media coverage has refused to voice their stance on the conflict.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/01/07/jihadists-last-thing-gaza-needs-minister.html,,2009
"Wed, January 7 2009",FPI recruits 60 volunteers to fight Israeli army,"ANTI-ISRAEL PROTEST: The Association of Muhammadiyah Students (IMM) stages a rally in front of the US Consulate General office in Surabaya on Tuesday, protesting Israeli attacks on Gaza. They failed to meet representatives of the consulate as they were not in office. (JP/ID Nugroho) Reacting to nationwide rallies condemning the Israeli military for laying siege to Gaza and the West Bank, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) has recruited 60 Muslim youths from Jember regency to dispatch as volunteers to fight the Israeli army in Palestine. ""If Muslims are injured and killed it must be revenged. We must help our brothers suffering grievance in the Israeli aggression,"" chairman of the East Java chapter of FPI Habib Haidar Al Hamid said in his speech to rally volunteers in Jember on Monday. He said his organization had recruited to the cause 60 of the 120 young Muslims that had signed a solidarity for Palestine petition. They are now undergoing what he called ""advance training"" at a pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in Sumberbaru district having cleared health and performance tests. Haidar said the volunteers would be deployed as mujahidins and soldiers in the front lines in Gaza to fight Israeli soldiers. ""The haves can donate a part of their wealth but we have only our bodies with which to wage a holy war against the Jewish country,"" he said. The chief of the FPI in Jember, Mukmin, who is also director of the pesantren , said a holy war must be volunteer-based. He said it was assumed that all those who joined had secured permission from their families. When asked by The Jakarta Post if they had permission, the volunteers replied they had, and added that they were ready to die for their Palestinian brothers. ""If you are permitted, go wage the holy war in the path of God,"" Mukmin told them. Although if they somehow managed to get into to Palestine to fight the Israeli army they would come face to face with some of the most advanced weaponry on the planet, the volunteers will only undergo brief self-defense training locally known as pencak silat (a traditional martial art) before they are dispatched. The volunteer recruitment has sparked strong widespread criticism, with many saying the would-be soldiers are ill-equipped, unprofessional and may not have any means to communicate on the ground or to endure the weather in the Middle Eastern region. Such failures were evident last century when equally unprepared Indonesian volunteers were dispatched to Afghanistan to wage holy war. Recalling the days when Indonesian people drove off the Dutch colonial government with bamboo spears, Hamid said he was optimistic the volunteers would win the war in Gaza and rid the land of Israeli soldiers.

"Wed, January 14 2009","Religious intolerance getting worse, says report","Religious intolerance is getting worse here, with state agencies, radical groups and community organizations involved in violations of freedom of faith and religion, according to a report released Tuesday. The recent sealing of the synagogue in Surabaya, East Java, by Muslims in a protest against the Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip was the latest case of religious intolerance in Indonesia. The incident was not included in the 2008 Report on the Condition of Religious and Faith Freedom in Indonesia, which was released by the Setara Institute for Democracy and Peace. But Setara Institute chairman Hendardi said the closure of the Jewish place of worship was against the principle of religious tolerance. “It is clearly part of religious violence and cannot be tolerated,” he told The Jakarta Post after launching the report. The report found 265 cases of violence against religions from January-December last year, a significant increase from only 135 cases in 2007. “The increase is spurred by the rising persecution against the Jamaah Ahmadiyah by Islamic organizations to pressure the government to issue a presidential decree banning the minority sect,” the report said. Last year, the government issued a joint ministerial decree forbidding Ahmadiyah from spreading its religious teachings, bowing to pressure from extremist groups that had attacked its followers, their mosques and houses across the country. Out of the 265 incidents, the institute recorded 367 violations against freedom of religion and faith. “Of the 367 violations, the state was involved in 188 cases of violence both by ‘commission and omission’,” Hendardi said. The report said police were involved in 121 cases of religious intolerance, regents and mayors in 28 cases while 52 others involved courts and regional legislative councils. “What is worrying is that more individuals and unidentified groups launched sporadic religious attacks, which reached 91 cases last year,” Hendardi said. The report blamed the radical Islamic Defender Front (FPI) and the Indonesian Ulama Council (MUI) as the main actors in the religious violence. “We record the MUI involved in 42 cases and the FPI in 27 cases including in the Monas incident last year,” he said, referring the brutal attack on activists during a pro-tolerance rally in the National Monument, Central Jakarta. The Setara conducted investigations in North Sumatra, South Sumatra, West Sumatra, Jakarta, Banten, West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta, South Sulawesi, South Kalimantan and West Nusa Tenggara. West Java was the province recording the highest rate of religious violence with 73 cases, followed by West Sumatra and Jakarta provinces with 56 and 45 cases, respectively. “Most of the cases took place in June when the government issued a joint ministerial decree to curb the activities of Ahmadiyah,” Hendardi said. Religious Affairs Minister Maftuh Basyuni claimed a 2006 decree on religious harmony had sharply decreased religious violence in the country. “This is big achievement,” he said Tuesday as quoted by Antara. The 2006 decree requires people to obtain government permits to build houses of worship. Earlier, the Wahid Institute said religious violence rose to 232 cases in 2008 from 197 in the previous year.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/01/14/religious-intolerance-getting-worse-says-report.html,,2009
"Thu, February 12 2009",`Jaipong becomes latest victim of porn law',"Threatened heritage: Several dancers perform the jaipong dance that the West Java government is proposing (JP/J.Adiguna) The controversial pornography law has been blasted for targeting cultural heritage, after West Java Governor Ahmad Heryawan used it as a legal basis to forbid jaipong dancers from wearing ""sexy"" costumes and executing ""provocative"" dance moves. The West Java administration's ban has prompted severe criticism from artists and legislators who blast it as a move to curb the traditional arts and culture of local people. Your comments: If those so called lawmakers are so confident, why don't they allow a referendum allowing the provinces a choice? Choice one: Immediate implementation of Sharia law and to become part of the Islamic Republic of Indonesia. Choice two: Independence for Bali, Nusa Tenggara Timor, Flores, West Papua and North Sulawesi. And, choice three: Continue as it is with economic stagnation, governance by remote control from Java, with eventual disintegration of the state anyway. Iwan Culture and arts will cry out, ""Help me, please don't ban me, I am the only one that can make you proud of your country!"" then, ""But I have no power unless you can give me a law that can protect me!"" Ketti Congratulations to the people of West Java. Finally, they have effectively promoted their jaipong dance, as proved by all the comments here. The tradition will go on, as actually the governor of West Java has not banned it at all. The issue of banning the dance is just rumor probably made up by its practitioners using the governor as the scapegoat. Widodo Santoso Surely, West Java Governor Ahmad Heryawan has better things to do than censoring jaipong. If he really thinks that forbidding jaipong dancers from wearing ""sexy"" costumes and executing ""provocative"" dance moves is more important than ensuring that the people of Sunda have clean water, good health services and schools and a chance of a job then perhaps it's time he found other employment. Greg K This is exactly what those opposed to the bill warned of, that it would be used by religious conservatives such as those in the PKS and the MUI for some Taliban-like cultural engineering. This kind of interventionism has nothing to do with protecting public morality and everything to do with imposing a Middle Eastern-derived interpretation of religion on the whole country. Before you know it, the FPI and other religious thugs will be busting up jaipong performances. Muhammad Santoso It just goes to show that the type of people that make such decisions need to be removed from government. You allow your country to be ruled by such people, and such people, in my opinion, are not capable of thinking laterally, they are dictators. Don't they have anything better to do, such as improve the health system, improve the roadways and improve pollution problem etc, than focus on something like a cultural dance. Next, they will move to ban all dances in Bali as well, such as the Kecak dance, as that surely must be considered pornographic. Michael Sellers That's Indonesia, not appreciating its own culture. Malaysia would be happy to ""patent"" this jaipong dance as a part of their heritage. Henry Halim This ill-advised and ludicrous pornography law is going to cause a lot more problems yet. What about all the other traditional and cultural dances throughout the country - especially in Java? Get rid of it before it does any more damage!

"Mon, February 23 2009",Plastic makers sink on rising demand,"Upstream plastic products are in short supply, while demand is rising ahead of this year’s general elections and harvest seasons. The condition has put downstream manufacturers in a quandary, caught between high domestic demand on the one hand, and the prohibitive rising costs and lengthy delivery times of importing raw materials, on the other hand. Budi Susanto Sadiman, secretary-general of the Indonesian Plastic and Olefin Industries Association (INAplas), said demand for polypropylene, a raw material used in plastic products, was surging incredibly. “We’re expecting the rice harvest season and the general elections, when which the consumption of plastic for food and beverage packaging increases,” he told The Jakarta Post over the weekend. In addition to the scarcity of polypropylene, the plastics industry has also been hit by increased import duties on two types of plastic raw materials: high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and copolymer polypropylene. A 2009 Finance Ministry decree has set import duties up from 0 to 5 percent for HDPE, and from 5 to 10 percent for copolymer polypropylene. The latter, a derivative of propylene, is used as a raw material in the production of, among others, rice and fertilizer sacks. Three polypropylene manufacturers in the country — PT Tri Polyta, PT Politama and state oil and gas firm Pertamina — each year produce 380,000 tons, 160,000 tons and 40,000 tons of polypropylene, respectively. “But now the three manufacturers collectively produce only 30,000 tons a month because of the lack of raw material,” Budi said. He added Tri Polyta had received an insufficient amount of propylene from petrochemical producer PT Chandra Asri because the latter had shut down since late January for maintenance and would resume production in late March. Politama faces a similar condition, having been left idle for three months after its sole propylene supplier — Pertamina’s refinery in Balongan, West Java — remained unable to produce polypropylene with the exact specifications Politama required, Budi said. He added the Balongan refinery had been under maintenance since last November and resumed operations in late January, but had since then not been able to fulfill Politama’s requests. “Therefore, the manufacturers cannot meet the domestic demand,” he said. Pertamina spokesman Anang Rizkiani Noor said one of the Balongan refinery’s components was under maintenance, “while production is going as normal”. “We are assured of finishing the repairs early next week,” he told the Post. “In the meantime, [INAplas] may speak directly to Pertamina if there is a problem in the specification [of our product].” The Indonesian Packaging Federation (FPI) also voiced their concern over the scarcity of polypropylene. FPI executive director Henky Wibawa told the Post that the packaging industry needed more than 200,000 tons of polypropylene a year. “We cannot meet our needs from overseas, either, because the price is picking up due to the material shortage, and we need it immediately, while imports may take two months for delivery,” Henky said. Polypropylene now sells for US$1,800 a ton, up by $200 a ton from its price in October last year, according to Henky.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/02/23/plastic-makers-sink-rising-demand.html,,2009
"Wed, June 3 2009",Letters: Love-beating,"It has been a year since that tragedy. The Monas Tragedy, June 1, 2008, when a group of people, including me, who intended to commemorate Pancasila Day were assaulted by the FPI. At that time, I had no idea that the tragedy would result in my rebirth. The tragedy indeed caused several wounds to my body; I can even still feel the trauma and the leftover symptoms. And justice has been served to those beaters and the brain of that tragedy. But after one year, is there anything more than just physical, mental trauma and the service of justice? For me, personally, the answer is: Yes, there is. Within one year from June 1, 2009, my life has changed. My faith, the basic color of my life, has changed to the color of love. When I reflected on that tragedy, one month after, in my note ""Open letter to Rizieq, Munarman"" that was published by The Jakarta Post, I prayed that Munarman and Habib Rizieq will find love and peace in their lives, so they will able to see beauty everywhere, including in the beauty of diversity. Now, I am not only pray for Habib Rizieq and Munarman to find love and peace in their lives, but I would also like to say that I love them. Habib Rizieq, I love you. Munarman, I love you. FPI, I love you. Love is coloring my whole life. And with this love, I see my life expanding. The Life that is given to me, with the love-beating from thte FPI, will not be exclusively mine. But this Life is my Motherland's: Indonesia. Silence and ignorance is not a choice for me, when my Motherland is crying over violence that happened in Indonesia. Love is my choice. And love is the only thing I have to spread with non-violent (ahimsa) actions, wherever and whenever I go. With the spirit of love and the path of non-violence, I will not stop to protect my Motherland of Indonesia from narrow fanatics and imported extremists, which is not suitable for Indonesian root culture. For love is the only solution. And I wouldn't be able to feel this love in my life without the love-beating from the FPI during the Monas Tragedy.

"Fri, August 28 2009",Jakarta prominent mass organization and ethnic groups,"Lutfi Hakim: JP/R. Berto Wedhatama Lutfi Hakim Betawi Brotherhood Forum (FBR) Leader: Lutfi Hakim ( 33 ) Members: 300,000 in Greater Jakarta. Membership requirement: Betawi (native Jakartan) and Muslim. For other ethnicities, must have lived in Jakarta for at least three years. Funding: Donations from members and businesses. Activities: Provides ""unofficial"" security services to companies engaged in entertainment businesses, property, construction projects and business centers. FBR members can also be seen guarding disputed property, providing debt-collection services and clearing out land. Its top brass also run small-scale printing business. The group is often used to provide political support for the Jakarta bureaucracy and certain Islamic parties, as evidenced when it condemned opponents of the controversial pornography bill. History: Founded on July 29, 2001, the FBR was charged by its recently deceased chief patron Fadhloly El Muhir to create jobs for the Betawi ethnic group. However, it was mired in allegations of receiving backing from the military, the Jakarta administration and opponents of former president Abdurrahman ""Gus Dur"" Wahid. The groups were used as proxies to deal with Gus Dur's grassroots Nadhlatul Ulama (NU) supporters from East Java, who threatened to flock to the capital to help keep Gus Dur in power. Lutfi denies the allegations, saying the FBR was set up merely to advocate for the revival of the long-marginalized Betawi. Notes: In March 2003, seven members of the group were jailed for attacking the head of the Urban Poor Consortium (an NGO focusing on urban development issues), Wardah Hafidz, near the office of the National Commission for Human Rights. Lutfi strongly opposes the stigma. Muhammad Rizieq: JP/Arief Suhardiman Muhammad Rizieq Islam Defenders Front (FPI) Leader: Al-Habib Muhammad Rizieq bin Husein Syihab ( 71 ) Members: Less than 10,000 in Greater Jakarta. Membership requirement: Muslims who can read the Koran. Funding: Mostly donations from members, business activities of the group's top brass. Activities: Mostly an ideological and political movement claiming to uphold Islamic law, implemented in the field through crackdowns on nightclubs, brothels and gambling dens, and leading more often than not to clashes and violence. Their targets include roadside vendors who stay open during the fasting month of Ramadan. Chairman of the Jakarta Association of Tourism, Recreation and Entertainment Adrian Maulete claims the association regularly pays the FPI to not raid its members' clubs while operating. History: Founded on Aug. 17, 1998, the FPI is a splinter group of the Pamswakarsa civil guard formed by the military to support the Habibie regime. Through promoting violence, the FPI has earned the respect of hard-line Muslims, but often become disdained by society at large. Notes: The FPI's litany of violence includes a bloody attack on members of the Alliance for the Freedom of Religion and Faith (AKKBB) in the National Monument park, Central Jakarta, on June 1, 2008. Group leader Habib Rizieq was sentenced to 18 months in prison for inciting the violence. He was released this July. FPI secretary-general Sobri Lubis says the FPI remains a force to be reckoned with, despite the recent police crackdown on its leaders, adding it will continue to ""wipe out immoral practices"" no matter how long it takes. ""We have nothing against the food or water these nightclubs offer, but if they start selling women, provide gambling venues or drugs, then we will have to stand against them."" Oding Djunaidi: JP/Nurhayati Oding Djunaidi Laskar Jayakarta (Jayakarta Warriors) Leader: Adj. Sr. Comr. Susilowadi, aka Bang Ilo ( 47 ) Members: 30,000 in Greater Jakarta. Membership requirement: All-inclusive, preference to native Jakartans. Funding: Mostly donations from members' and leaders' businesses. Activities: Laskar Jayakarta assists Jakarta residents, especially of Betawi ethnicity, get jobs. Nurturing close ties with the police, the group provides unofficial security services primarily to nightclubs, retailers, hotels and boarding houses in the Tamansari district of West Jakarta. The district, which covers the vicinity of Jl. Mangga Besar, Jl. Hayam Wuruk, Jl. Gadjah Mada and the Glodok business center, is Jakarta's largest night entertainment center and accounts for 60 percent of the business. Laskar's top officials are former members of Pemuda Pancasila youth organization, the military's family forum (Forkabi) and the FBR. History: As a newcomer in the industry, it was not until 2007 that Laskar Jayakarta became widely known, when it supported Comr. Gen. (ret) Adang Daradjatun, the former National Police deputy chief, in his 2007 bid to be Jakarta governor. Laskar split from the Betawi Community Union (PMB) in 2004. Notes: The group's structure is loosely reminiscent of many of today's Jakarta-based groups. Laskar Jayakarta is a proxy nurtured by the police to help maintain order in Jakarta's night entertainment hub and prevent ethnic clashes. ""Bang Ilo himself ordered us to control our members' behavior to keep in line with the law,"" says Oding, the head of the group's Tamansari branch in Central Jakarta. Japto Soerjosoemarno: JP/Ricky Yudhistira Japto Soerjosoemarno Pancasila Youth Leader: Japto Soelistyo Soerjosoemarno ( 59 ) Members: Less than 100,000 in Greater Jakarta. Membership requirement: All ethnicities and religions. Funding: Mostly donations from members, business activities of the group's top brass. Activities: Security services and debt collection are the major income earner of the group, as well as land clearing for businesses. History: Pancasila Youth was established on Oct. 28, 1959, by former legendary military commander Abdul Haris Nasution, with the sole aim of confronting the communist threat. However, after 1978, it evolved with the backing of the Soeharto regime and the Golkar Party, which used it to mobilize youth support during general elections. The Pancasila Youth was allegedly involved in the July 27, 1996, riot and the bloody sectarian violence in Ambon, Maluku, in 2000. Notes: Along with the Soeharto downfall in 1998, Pancasila Youth lost its political and security clout, which finally led in late 2003 to Yorris Raweyai, its most influential figure and financier, falling out with Japto over the latter's decision to set up the Patriot Party, the political wing of the Pancasila Youth. Yorris remains with Golkar and became legislator for the party, while the Patriot Party failed to get any legislative seat. With funding, notably from Yorris, drying up, most of the group's members now moonlight with other mass organizations, including the FBR, the FPI and Laskar Jayakarta. According to Yorris, Pancasila Youth is now focusing on recruiting university students, intellectuals and the middle class to help keep the group afloat. Japto's youngest son, Jedidiah Shenazar, is being groomed to take over his father's work. Jhon Kei: Media Indonesia/Faishol Taselan Jhon Kei Eastern Indonesia factions Leaders: Herkules (East Timor group), Jhon Kei (Kei Island group in Maluku), Rony Syauta and Umar Kei (Indonesian Mollucans Youth Union, or PMB) and Ongen Sangaji (Ambon group in Maluku). Members: Each group is believed to have less than 1,000 members in Greater Jakarta, except the PMB, which has around 20,000. Membership requirement: Exclusive to ethnicity. Activities: Groups are engaged in intense rivalry with one another. In the case of the Maluku groups, not a single leader has united them. Both the East Timor and Maluku groups are competing to win orders for security services for disputed parties, business centers and properties. They are also the most efficient debt collectors employed by banks, financing companies and individuals, primarily through intimidation. They earn between 15 percent and 50 percent of the debt collected. Notes: - Herkules has since 2006 lost his lucrative empire in the Tanah Abang business center to Betawi native Haji Lulung. Herkules followers still maitain a loose grip on several small pockets in the Kota area of North Jakarta. Herkules is now engaged in the coal business, and spends time mostly in Kalimantan and Sumatra. - John Kei, a notorious gang leader, is serving a jail term in Surabaya for cutting the fingers of two of his cousins. - Ongen Sangaji is now an executive with the Hanura Party, founded by former military commander Gen. (ret) Wiranto. - Rony Syauta and Umar Kei are emerging as key players in the business. The group controls the largest Maluku group in East Jakarta. The PMB is now trying to unite all Maluku gangs, but to no avail thus far. Haji Lulung: JP/J. Adiguna Haji Lulung Haji Lulung group Leader: Abraham Lunggana, aka Haji Lulung ( 48 ) Members: More than 2,000 in Tanah Abang alone. Membership requirement: Preference for native Jakartans. Other ethnic groups also welcome. Funding: Companies under Haji Lulung, donations from outsourced workers. Activities: Haji Lulung has a vast line of businesses, including security services, parking and waste management. Around 90 percent of such businesses in Tanah Abang, Southeast Asia's largest textile and garment distribution area, is organized by Haji Lulung. Through his newly established law firm, Haji Lulung & Associates, a debt-collection business is now in the pipeline. Haji Lulung's tentacles also take in security services for shopping centers in the vicinity of Hotel Indonesia in Central Jakarta, Senayan in South Jakarta, Taman Ismail Marzuki in Central Jakarta, the Aldira shopping center in East Jakarta, Tarakan Hospital, Cengkareng Hospital, Fatmawati Hospital and the Bogor Mental Hospital. History: Assisted primarily by law enforcers and the Jakarta administration, Haji Lulung's luck started to turn in 2000 when he supplied workers for the construction of the Metro bridge in the Tanah Abang shopping compound. His rise is also attributed to the need for opposition against former president Abdurrahman ""Gus Dur"" Wahid in creating a proxy Betawi-based group to confront the threat of Gus Dur's incoming grass-roots supporters from East Java in 2001. Since then, without spilling much blood, Haji Lulung has gradually expelled the notorious godfather Herkules from Tanah Abang for good in 2006. Notes: Haji Lulung is now a city councilor for the United Development Party (PPP). - JP/Rendi A.

"Wed, September 9 2009",Students demand harsher sharia law implementation,"Students from the Communication Forum for Sharia staged a rally on Tuesday at the Aceh legislative council building in Banda Aceh, demanding legislators immediately approve the jinayat, or Islamic criminal law, before the end of their tenure this year. Groups affiliated with the forum - FPI Aceh, Unsyiah Students Administration, KAMMI Aceh and PMII Aceh - also demanded that the Islamic sharia law, which has already been imposed in Aceh, be correctly implemented. ""We urge the legislature to immediately enact jinayat. Don't be afraid to implement Islamic sharia law truthfully in Aceh,"" said Tengku Arya from the Islamic Defenders Front. Jinayat, currently a draft law waiting to be enacted, outlines the sentences to be applied to those violating sharia law. It also lists the agencies authorized to oversee, prosecute and execute punishments pertaining to sharia law in Aceh. The sharia law will be more strict if jinayat is implemented in Aceh. Article 37 of the draft jinayat, for example, clearly states that a person who commits adultery faces 100 cane lashes, or the death penalty. ""Unmarried couples committing adultery will be caned, while married people will be sentenced to death,"" said Aceh Legislative council special committee XII head Bachrom M. Rasyid. Besides punishing violators, jinayat also regulates sentences for individuals or entities abetting others violating sharia law with regards to adultery, such as beauty salons, motels or hotels. Legislative and executive institutions are still deliberating the draft law because of the numerous clauses in it sparking controversy. The Aceh provincial administration said the National Commission on Human Rights had requested the United Nations evaluate the content of a number of provisions in the draft law, such as the ones on caning and stoning to death, deemed as improper nowadays. KAMMI leader Basri Efendi said sharia law had so far not been implemented according to the wishes of the Acehnese community. Law enforcers in Aceh are often lenient when meting out punishments against sharia law offenders, whose numbers have further increased despite the presence of ordinances and regulations that can be used to punish them, Efendi said. However, many critics deplore the implementation of sharia law as it violates human rights and hampers investment in Aceh. In response to the student demands, legislator Rayhan Iskandar said the council was reviewing the jinayat draft law, promising them it would soon be passed. ""We have even submitted the draft law to the Supreme Court,"" said Rayhan. Rayhan said Aceh would be the only province in Indonesia with its own legal system equivalent to the criminal code based on Islam, if the jinayat draft law was approved. The police and prosecutors will also have the right and authority to arrest and prosecute offenders in Aceh.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/09/09/students-demand-harsher-sharia-law-implementation.html,,2009
"Sat, October 10 2009",FPI rallies against Miyabi; producer continues,"While the lurid indictment depicting a titillating handjob between Antasari Azhar and golf caddy Rhani Juliani (aired live on national television) apparently failed to enrage hardliners, a comedy film that will feature Japanese porn star Maria ""Miyabi"" Ozawa - who will definitely remain fully clothed throughout - has sparked serious protests. Dozens of members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) rallied in front of Maxima Pictures production house in Mangga Dua, North Jakarta, on Friday afternoon after the mass prayer, demanding that Miyabi be removed from the film. ""We reject Miyabi's visit! She must not be allowed into Indonesia.

Ody Mulya Hidayat, the film producer of Menculik Miyabi (Kidnapping Miyabi), said he appreciated protesters' aspirations, but that he could not accommodate them. ""This film has to be made because we have signed a contract with the Japanese side. We would be embarrassed if we have to cancel it,"" Ody told The Jakarta Post over the phone. Miyabi's planned visit on Oct. 14 will be postponed until Maxima can find a solution to ease the tension, he said. Ody said his previous attempts to reassure the public that Maxima was making a comedy (not pornography), had been unsuccessful because hardliners simply objected to Miyabi on the grounds she is a porn star. ""There are many Indonesian movie stars who *used to be porn stars*, who returned to favour after playing roles in good movies. If a porn star wants to appear in a non-porn movie, why shouldn't they?"" he said. Miyabi, one of the main characters in Menculik Miyabi, written by witty blogger Raditya Dika, will not perform any of the erotic scenes she is famous for. Ody said a number of organizations responsible for censorship would determine whether the film is fit for viewing. With her distinctive looks, and a mix of genes from her Japanese mother and French-Canadian father, Miyabi rose to global stardom after first appearing in the flesh in 2005. One FPI protester admitted to having seen Miyabi naked in a movie uploaded to a mobile phone. ""I have watched a video of her on a mobile phone, but it was blurred and was not clear. The video is morally destructive,"" said Fajar, 20, as quoted by okezone.com. When asked why he had watched the film, Fajar said he had seen it unintentionally. He said his own mobile phone did not contain any such videos, because pornography was haram. The protest ran peacefully, with more than 50 officers from Sawah Besar Police guarding the Maxima office. Sawah Besar Police chief Comr. Iskandar said the protesters were not carrying sharp weapons.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/10/10/fpi-rallies-against-miyabi-producer-continues.html,,2009
"Sat, October 17 2009",Comments: Govt bans Miyabi from visiting RI,"Acting Culture and Tourism Minister Mohammad Nuh has issued a directive to deny entry to Japanese adult video star Maria ""Miyabi"" Ozawa to Indonesia. Nuh, who is also the information and communications minister, said in a press release made available to Antara the directive was shown to the producer and director of a comedy film currently in production titled Menculik Miyabi (Kidnapping Miyabi) during a meeting at his office earlier in the day. Your comments: ""Acting Culture and Tourism Minister Mohammad Nuh has issued a directive to deny entry."" What does that mean? Why is the acting culture minister issuing immigration directives? And what is a directive? Is it a personal opinion or a cast-in-iron official order? Is Nuh a Duh and just acting? It was never stated as to whether Miyabi would be doing nude scenes or not; I presume from the scant information about the film, not. So why is her appearance in a film being shot in Indonesia such a problem? Culture implies evolution; I see M. Nuh and all the others who have a problem with her visit as being primitive, without culture. Therefore Duh Nuh is an actor. A. A. European Union Oh my Goodness. She cannot come here to shoot a comedy film, because of her line of work in another country. Way to go Indonesia! I'd say go shoot the film in Japan then, or anywhere else but here for that matter. Chris H. Jakarta I cannot decide who is more misguided - the students who think that Miyabi appearing in a comedy film will suddenly increase the pornography available in Indonesia OR the government who know-tows to every demand by radical and vocal Muslim groups. The students should go to Glodok and see how much porn is for sale - it's not because of Miyabi but because of traders who understand their local customers. I read statements by the students that they fear she will ""do pornography"" while here in Indonesia. No, she will likely behave very well while she is in Indonesia and I'm sure she will be charming. Her pornographic movies will still be available at the usual sources, probably filmed in Japan. You don't need to come to Jakarta to ""do pornography""! Mark Denesevich US I often watch porn, but I don't even know who Miyabi is. I am just wondering, how can FPI have better knowledge about a porn star than me? Lianto Osa Jakarta Miyabi is a symbol of porn artist. Abar Jakarta What Indonesian youths need right now are good role models and the visit of a porn star is sending the wrong message. Indonesia must respect the concerns of Muslims who view such blatant disregard for morality as offensive. It is true that Indonesia has its own share of social promiscuity, but steps should be taken to address internal problems. And Maxima's efforts are not helping. Dawud Farquhar Singapore No opposition Your comments on the absence of strong opposition after the second and third largest parties - Golkar and the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) also prefer to join President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's administration. Your comments: Golkar is responsible for the dark chapter of the country's history. What else is new? Johan P. Beijing Following the election of Taufik Kiemas (the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle's patron) with the backing of the Democratic Party as the People's Consultative Assembly speaker, and the election Aburizal Bakrie as the chairman of Golkar, who vowed to bring his party closer to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the country's democracy is likely change its course. With all major and smaller parties joining the government it means there will be no opposition. Without an opposition, the President's second term is unlikely to encounter obstacles in making laws and regulations. In theory, a government without an opposition usually tends to be authoritarian, and the centralization system of government may recur as it did for three decades before the reform era. If this is repeated, Indonesia's good image under Yudhoyono's first term may be in danger, unless he really is committed to democracy as reflected by the ideal of his party.

"Sat, December 12 2009","Ahmadis terrorized by FPI, detained","Tebet Police officers in South Jakarta held six Ahmadis at their station Friday after area residents, some of whom claimed to be members of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), raided a house used by Ahmadis for religious activities. South Jakarta Police chief Sr. Comr. Gatot Edy Pramono said the incident occurred after Ahmadiyah members held Friday prayers in a small house in Bukit Duri Tanjakan subdistrict. As they were leaving, dozens of thugs who had been waiting outside started an argument. ""Only when the situation got out of hand, did several Tebet Police officers arrive and take the Ahmadis to their station to protect them from possible violence,"" Gatot told The Jakarta Post Friday. None of the FPI thugs were warned, let alone arrested for inciting violence. Salim Alatas, a deputy head of the FPI's Jakarta branch, said his gang were looking to start a fight. He said the FPI demanded the police detain the Ahmadis for violating a ministerial decree and ""insulting"" Islam. ""They claimed they were Muslims, but later admitted they were Ahmadis after we questioned them,"" he said, adding that several Ahmadiyah followers managed to escape during the cruel, illegal raid. The decree, signed by then religious affairs minister Maftuh Basyuni, home minister Mardiyanto and Attorney General Hendarman Supandji in June 2008, did not explicitly ban or dissolve the religious sect. The document ordered Ahmadiyah followers to turn to the beliefs of ""mainstream Islam"" and prohibits the sect from ""spreading inter-pretations and activities that deviate from the principal teachings of Islam."" There are about 200,000 practicing Ahmadis in Indonesia. For years, Ahmadis have suffered attacks from various hard-line groups. Some of these attacks resulted in the fire-bombing of Ahmadiyah mosques and houses. The group was deemed heretic by so-called religious ""leaders"" for recognizing sect founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as the last prophet. Islam maintains the Prophet Muhammad is the last prophet. The Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) declared Ahmadiyah heretical in 2005. This is the same group that, aping its Malaysian counterpart, issued an idiotic ban on yoga. Head thugs from the FPI, the Islamic Ulema Forum (FUI) and the Indonesian Mujahidin Council (MMI) have criticized the government for allowing the sect to continue its activities. Responding to the incident, an Ahmadiyah spokesman Syamsir Ali said such incidents were common.

"Thu, February 4 2010",Militant groups ready to defend controversial law,"The Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) and Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) said they would defend the controversial blasphemy law, calling the move to scrap the 45-year-old  law as an attempt to “liberalize” and destroy Islam. The two radical groups have met with Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali to lend their support  to the government to fight against the plan of human rights groups to have the law reviewed by the Constitutional Court. The review is backed by promoters of pluralism, including recipient of the Magsasay Award and Muhammadiyah patron Ahmad Syafii Maarif and the late Abdurrahman “Gus Dur” Wahid, widely respected in the Nahdlatul Ulama. FPI lawyer Munarman said the judicial review request had no legal standing because the NGOs are not religious organizations. The individuals joining the petition were not those whose Constitutional rights had been denied, and therefore had no right to file a judicial review, he said on the group’s website. HTI spokesman Ismail Yusanto called on Muslims to support the government to defend Islam from any assaults, including the judicial review of the blasphemy law. The group had appointed the Muslim Lawyers Team, or TPM, as its representative in the hearing at the Constitutional Court, scheduled to commence on Thursday. They had filed a request at the court to be given a say in the hearing. “The MK has not responded to our request yet,” Mahendradatta of TPM told The Jakarta Post. The TPM, which also represent a group called the Peace Alliance Against Blasphemy of Islam (ADA API), accused the petitioners of using the slogan of freedom of religion as a cover to discredit religions. “They are actually seeking ‘freedom to insult religions’,” Mahendradatta said. He said Hizbut Tahrir members and other Muslim groups will attend the hearings to show their support for the government. “Thousands of Muslims are apprehensive about the review. They may be curious and want to attend the hearings,” claimed Mahendradtta, who was also a defense lawyer for the Bali bombers. Uli Parulian Sihombing, a lawyer for the review petitioners, deplored the meeting between the religious minister and the militant groups. “A minister should not conduct such a meeting. The worst thing is, we are also informed that the meeting used state funds,” he told the Post. Suryadharma Ali said his ministry and the Law and Human Rights Ministry have made preparations to counter the arguments of the rights activists. He blasted the judicial review request as “irrational”, saying that it would only hurt the existing six officially recognized religions — Islam, Catholicism, Protestanism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism — and create disharmony. The minister said freedom of religion as guaranteed in the Constitution should be practiced in accordance with the existing regulations, which he said were made to protect other people’s rights to freedom of religion. The minister took the view that the emergence of religious sects was a form of blasphemy against existing religions. The government, he said as quoted by Antara, had the responsibility to do whatever it could do to maintain religious harmony.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/02/04/militant-groups-ready-defend-controversial-law.html,,2010
"Fri, February 5 2010",Court to stage debate on religious freedom,"The Constitutional Court will see one of its longest hearings as it becomes a forum for clerics, activists, pundits and artists to debate whether the country should revoke a 45-year-old blasphemy law to uphold freedom of religion. The court opened Thursday the first hearing of a judicial review filed by a number of human rights groups against the 1965 Blasphemy Law, which they said was adverse to human rights principles and irrelevant to a democratic Indonesia. The review has been strongly opposed by the government and major Muslim organizations  as well as hardline groups including the Islam Defender’s Front (FPI), whose members staged a rally outside the court Thursday. The court is set to present 31 experts, including sociologist Imam Prasodjo, poet Emha Ainun Nadjib, novelist Andrea Hirata and filmmaker Garin Nugroho, to share their opinions on the issue. “The examination will be extensive,” court chief Mahfud M.D said. “We usually hold a hearing every fourteen days, but in this case, we will hold it weekly.” The examination will take at least four months. The petitioners will present experts including Ahmad Syafii Maarif, Franz Magnis-Suseno, Luthfi Assyaukanie and Cole Durham, professor of law from the US, who will speak at the court via a teleconference. Syafii will be speaking against his colleagues in Muhammadiyah, which, like Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), officially expressed its opposition to the judicial review. Ten Islamic organizations, including Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia, will also be given a say in court. The government and the House of Representatives are against the judicial review. In Thursday’s hearing, Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali demanded the court reject the activists’ request on the grounds that no petitioners had their constitutional rights denied because of the law. “We ask the court to decide if the judicial review request is unacceptable,” the minister said Suryadharma also said the law had for decades served to maintain harmony in religiously diverse Indonesia. “Annulling the law will create conflict, instability and disharmony. It is urgently needed to endorse religious tolerance.” Justice and Human Rights Minister Patrialis Akbar argued that religious freedom did not mean people could practice their beliefs regardless of existing laws. Chairuman Harahap, representing the legislators, concurred with Patrialis, saying the law remained relevant though it was created decades ago. “From a sociological perspective, a law should be in line with the will of the people,” he said. Uli Parulian Sihombing, a lawyer for petitioners, said they were not asking for absolute freedom, but assurance that religious interpretation on certain religious teachings were not subject to prosecution by the state. Uli referred to the case of Jamaah Ahmadiyah, an Islamic sect that has been declared heretical and banned by the government. In 2008, a pro-Ahmadiyah group called the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion, was attacked by FPI and Hizbut Tahrir members, who strongly supported the government’s move to ban Ahmadiyah.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/02/05/court-stage-debate-religious-freedom.html,,2010
"Thu, February 11 2010","Blasphemy law, a shackle to the Indonesian people","Indonesia, the third-largest democracy in the world, may be facing gloomy days ahead. In December 2009, the late former president Abdurrahman “Gus Dur” Wahid led a coalition of civil society organizations in filing a judicial review against the archaic blasphemy law (PNPS No. 1/1965). A move to abolish this problematic law would expectedly further consolidate Indonesia’s democracy, freedom and harmony. Unfortunately there is strong resistance from the government and several religious and social groups against this move. Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali and Justice and Human Rights Minister Patrialis Akbar officially rejected this judicial review. On Feb. 4, Suryadharma Ali met with leaders of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) and Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) to talk about the judicial review. This is an unbelievably disappointing move by a government official of his stature. The FPI is a militant organization and the HTI is a global organization whose aim is to combine all Muslim countries into a unitary Islamic state or caliphate. The HTI is an organization that is even banned and proscribed in many Arab and Islamic countries. The FPI, and particularly the HTI, should not have a say on matters of the Indonesian people. The HTI does not represent the interests of the Indonesian people and our nation. The argument proposed by defenders of this blasphemy law, is  that the law is meant to maintain harmony and peace among religions. Forgive me for saying this: “It is complete baloney!” This PNPS No. 1/1965 has been the ground on which the Criminal Code (KUHP), article 156a, rests. This KUHP, instead of maintaining peace and harmony, has been the umbrella under which various militant groups attack, burn and destroy others. A recent example is the case of Welhelmina Holle in Masohi, Central Maluku, in December 2008. There were accusations and rumors that Holle, an elementary school teacher, had been offensive about a religion in one of his lectures in class. As a result, a mob ran amok and destroyed 67 houses, a house of worship, and a community building. Hole was put on trial under the pretext of that law. It is the existence of the blasphemy law that ignites conflict. It does not maintain harmony and peace. The blasphemy law is just problematic on so many levels. Ironically it appears that many support it. Newspaper reports regarding the blasphemy law may seem to picture a widespread rejection to the judicial review. But it is important to take this with a grain of salt. Opposition to the judicial review is only proclaimed by heads of institutions and a mob of “radical” groups with loud voices. Most Indonesians are perhaps rather oblivious or rather ignorant regarding the case. Considering it is not on the headlines and the complicity of jargons used in the case. However, we can be sure if explained properly, the public will want the abolition of the blasphemy law. Not only is this law problematic sociologically as illustrated above. It is in direct contradiction to our Constitution. Indonesia is a unitary state. The highest law of the land is the Constitution (UUD 1945), and all the laws under it should be in line with the Constitution. On the same token all the lower laws of the land should also not contradict each other. An important point to note is: our Constitution protects religious freedom to its citizens as individuals, not the freedom for religious groups to bash on others. Article 28E on freedom of religion clearly states that each person/human/citizen has the right to choose and believe according to their conscience. In 2008, Indonesia ratified an International Convention on discrimination and passed a law to abolish Racial and Ethnic Discrimination (UU PDRE). This law rules that no one can be discriminated based on their beliefs, values or rituals that belongs to their group (articles 3, 4). In short, the antiquated blasphemy law is no longer needed. It violates the Constitution and is also in contradiction to a law of equal stature (UU PDRE). In 2007, Hudson Institute published a comprehensive study on freedom of religion around the world. The study ranked countries in the same manner as Freedom House’s rankings. A country is ranked from 1 to 7, 1 being most free and 7 not free or repressed. Indonesia was ranked at 5 (partly free). A surprise and disappointment, particularly considering Malaysia was ranked at 4. At that time I did not agree with the classification given by Hudson Institute. Regardless of the various horizontal conflicts (cited by Hudson as reason for the low ranking of Indonesia), it did not make sense that Indonesia is less free in terms of religious freedom compared to Malaysia. But today, I think Hudson Institute was accurate after all. Although the blasphemy law case has not hit headlines in local newspapers, the International Community observes us closely. For example, the Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty has submitted an amicus brief in support of the judicial review to the Constitutional Court. The deterioration or progress of freedom in Indonesia is important not only to Indonesians but also to the world. We do not and should no longer live in the Dark Ages where blasphemy laws, inquisitions and burning of heretics are part of society. Indonesia is a religious country based on harmony, peace, multiculturalism and acceptance of differences. It is important for our leaders to realize that without religious freedom, Indonesia cannot move forward. Many academic studies show the strong correlation between economic growth and religious freedom. The works of Ilan Alon and Gregory Chase “Religious Freedom and Economic Prosperity” and the extensive studies of Grim and Finke are only a tip of the iceberg of evidences showing that religious freedom is important for a country’s growth and prosperity. The decision by the Constitutional Court under Mahfud M.D. will be an immensely important one regarding the future of the nation. It will be a very tough decision, considering the amount of political and organizational pressure on the Constitutional Court. It should have the courage to make a decision based on what is right, rather than submit to pressure.

Besides, the Religious Affairs Ministry, which defends only a conservative Islam, and the Justice and Human Rights Ministry, should be two poles apart.

Brien D Brisbane Indonesia is heading towards a Taliban-like state, where minorities will be more discriminated against (at the least) than now; women, old ladies and girls, will be forced to hide their hair, throat, even face; and the extremely rich local culture will be replaced by the misogynistic traditions of the desert.

I couldn't agree more, considering that this issue has been bothering me for quite some time now. The blasphemy law needs to be erased, because as long as it exists, Indonesia's so-called ""democracy"" is just an empty, meaningless word. How ironic, boasting of democracy everywhere yet these people still hold dear the one thing that clearly is an absolute obstacle for Indonesia to be a purely democratic country. I have to admit, I'm ashamed. NN Jakarta Having visited Indonesia three times now and still living in the United States, I would say that Indonesia has in certain areas more religious freedom than the US and in other areas, less. While visiting last time my wife (from Indonesia) and I visited her previous workplace and one of her old co-workers openly prayed for her at his desk. That would never be allowed in the US. On the other hand, openly preaching on a street corner is not allowed, but in the US it is. It truly is sad when the radicals ruin it for everyone else.

"Fri, March 5 2010",Inaccurate and misleading reports on HTI,"Frankly, this is not the first time The Jakarta Post has published misinformation regarding Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI). A number of news reports have been clearly inaccurate and misleading. Such reports do not do justice to local or international readers in providing the balanced points of view they deserve to make up their own minds about HTI. For instance, on Feb. 2, 2010 the Post reported that the National Alliance for the Freedom of Religion and Faith (AKKBB) sought a judicial review of the blasphemy law (Law No. 1/PNPS/1965) by the Constitutional Court. The Post wrote “Militant groups ready to defend controversial law”. The article went on to say: “The Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) and Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) said they would defend the controversial blasphemy law, calling the move to scrap the 45-year-old law an attempt to ‘liberalize’ and destroy Islam. The two radical groups have met with Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali to lend their support to the government to fight against the plan of human rights groups to have the law reviewed by the Constitutional Court.” The use of the “militant groups” or “radical groups” carries negative connotations as if HTI belongs to a group that does not believe in dialogue and commits violence to propagate its messages. Moreover, it is unfair to single out HTI, because the two largest Muslim organizations — Nahdhatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyyah — have both expressed support for the 1965 law also. In addition to condoning the use of unfair labeling, the Post also published wrong information about a meeting between the religious affairs minister and HTI. The Post quoted a statement by AKKBB lawyer Uli Parulian without verification from an HTI source. On Feb. 4, the Post cited Uli Parulian Sihombing who “...deplored the meeting between the religious minister and the militant groups. ‘A minister should not conduct such a meeting. The worst thing is, we are also informed that the meeting used state funds,’ he told the Post.” We stress the fact that HTI never attended the said meeting, though HTI fully supports the cause for defending the 1965 law. Even worse, the Post also reported that HTI members attacked AKKBB during the 2008 demonstration supporting Ahmadiyah at the National Monument (Monas) square. This is incorrect. HTI was never involved directly or indirectly in this incident. HTI is an Islamic group that seeks the implementation of sharia via the reinstatement of the Caliphate, purely by intellectual and political means, without resorting to any acts of violence. The most recent opinion piece by Tobias Basuki published by the Post on Feb. 11 also referred to a meeting between the religious affairs minister with HTI and FPI on Feb. 4, 2010. Again, HTI did not even attend the meeting and FPI was not the only group which met with the minister. Tobias has also ignored another fact: that tremendous support for the 1965 Law has come from a number of religious groups. Instead, Tobias labeled “groups with loud voices” whom he collectively called the “radical mob”, which is clearly uncalled for. Oxford dictionary describes a mob being “a disorderly crowd of people”. Using Tobias logic, supporters of the law are simply a “radical and militant mob”, which includes grassroots religious organizations, like NU and Muhammadiyah. Curiously, Tobias wrote, “The FPI, and particularly the HTI, should not have a say on matters of the Indonesian people. The HTI does not represent the interests of the Indonesian people and our nation.” First of all, Tobias has no right to judge HTI and FPI as having no say in matters of the Indonesian people. All Indonesian citizens have the right to get involved and strive for the betterment of Indonesia itself. Moreover, being the largest Muslim country, Indonesia has significant numbers of FPI and HTI members spread throughout its 33 provinces and in more than 300 cities. So who can deny the rights of FPI and HTI who are obviously Indonesian citizens? How could one conclude that HTI and its members have no concern for the affairs of the Indonesian people? Second, notwithstanding having very easy access to verification, Tobias seems to conveniently ignore various HTI activities. HTI is clearly concerned with the current condition of the people and their nation that has been struggling with poverty, corruption, moral decadence, injustice, exploitation and ignorance. From HTI’s point of view, the source of the problem is untrustworthy leadership running a bankrupt secular system. Therefore, HTI offers a justifiable, testable and conceptual solution, i.e. Islamic sharia. Rallying on a singular theme “Save Indonesia with Sharia”, HTI has organized various activities to remind the people that the Islamic solution emanating from the Most Benevolent and Merciful is the only answer for humanity. This system or Islamic sharia will liberate the people from the shackles of secular capitalism and corrupt and exploitative rulers. As for HTI, the efforts to liberate the people from poverty, ignorance, decadence, crime and national disintegration are religious duties. HTI moves, works and breathes with the people in criticizing and speaking out against unjust policies such as energy price increases, privatization of state companies, dependency on foreign debt, commercialization of education and public health that add burdens to our current misery. HTI also offers the practical solution of Islamic sharia, which states that the state must provide the basic needs of individual citizens such as food, clothing and housing in addition to free education and accessible health services. HTI asserts that natural resources belong to the people and must be administered by the state with full responsibility and accountability instead of being contracted out to foreign companies. Moreover, HTI has also exposed dangerous moves in Papua, Aceh and Ambon, which potentially lead to national disintegration. Even more importantly, HTI is deeply concerned with the purity of the Islamic creed adopted by the majority of Indonesian citizens. Moreover, the harmony among different religious communities must also be protected. In this context, HTI has participated in the defense of the 1965 law that is currently under judicial review. The abolition of the law will lead to the mushrooming of various sects that can blaspheme or smear existing Islamic creed, or any other religious creeds for that matter. Without a law to protect religious creed, social conflicts will very likely occur unimpeded. The 1965 law does not encroach on the right to embrace any religion. Islam itself never forces anyone to convert. According to Islamic sharia, every religious adherent is free to perform their own rites. However, the freedom of ritual expression does not constitute the freedom to blaspheme against other religions. This is why the 1965 law is needed to avoid blasphemous acts that may ignite great social discords. HTI does not view the law as a cause of violence. Au contraire, the failure to enforce the 1965 law has pushed some members of society to take matters into their own hands. Social unrest occurs because of a lack of action by the state to prosecute blatant offenses perpetrated by certain individuals and/or deviant sects that have attacked or ridiculed well known Islamic tenets. Are there any rational persons who are ready to face the resulting instability as a consequence of abolishing the law and bear the responsibility simultaneously? Seeking to abolish the 1965 law is tantamount to wishing for social conflicts. HTI has carefully deliberated these aforementioned points and decided to join effort to prevent the abolition of the 1965 law as sought by a handful of groups. One may then question the legal standing of AKKBB among others who seek the abolition of the 1965 law. They are neither religious groups nor promoting a religious agenda. So who says HTI has no say in this matter? Clearly HTI and the Post may each endorse different and perhaps opposing opinions up to this very day.

"Mon, March 15 2010",Letter: On blasphemy law,"I refer to the report on the review of the blasphemy law (The Jakarta Post, 11 March 2010). There seems to be some confusion between the terms blasphemy and heresy, which are two different things, but nevertheless I would comment as follows. As an Islamic scholar, Habib Rizieq must be aware that nowhere does the Koran prescribe death as a penalty for apostasy, and that the hadith generally used to justify this punishment is, at the very least, of dubious validity, and many reputable scholars regard it as certainly spurious. Moreover, during the Prophet’s lifetime and for some time thereafter, the only instances of apostates being killed are those in which apostates took up arms against Muslims, in that period a small and insecure group still finding its way. I recall that a few years ago, Rizieq was reported in this newspaper to have said that the FPI leadership could not be responsible for the behavior of its followers. I beg to differ, for the answer to the problem lies in the hands of Islamic leaders in general, and especially with Rizieq, who is uniquely placed to preach the true, peaceful message of Islam as revealed in the Koran, and so restrain the extraordinary and un-Islamic thirst for violence displayed by some of his membership.

"Thu, March 18 2010",Antiterror raid Police arrest two more suspects in Aceh,"Police have arrested two of 14 suspects wanted for their involvement in terrorist activities in Aceh, National Police chief Gen. Bambang Hendarso Danuri said Wednesday. The arrest of Marzuki and Maulana from Bireuen and Lhokseumawe came after the pair surrendered themselves to local police on Tuesday, Bambang said. Police also seized an M-16 rifle and three pistols. “This was the report that reached me as soon as I arrived back in Jakarta,” Bambang said at the State Palace as quoted by kompas.com. “We are still hunting for the remaining 12 terrorist suspects.” Bambang visited Aceh on Tuesday, a few days after the police shot dead two terrorist suspects, who had been linked to a group that was raided in Pamulang, south of Jakarta, last week. Separately in Aceh, a terrorist suspect identified as Muktar surrendered himself to Lhokseumawe Police on Wednesday. Police confiscated an M-16 rifle, hundreds of rounds of ammunition and three revolvers from him. Muktar turned himself in after police ransacked his house in Lhokseumawe, North Aceh, on Monday. A number of suspicious items had been discovered in the raid, including a backpack, map and shirt with the inscription “Mujahidin Atjeh Center”. Muktar was accompanied by Darul Mujahidin pesantren caretaker Tengku Muslim At Thahiri when surrendered. Muslim’s wife, Intan, protested when police also detained her husband, claiming her husband had never been involved in the armed group. Intan said her husband had helped police by handing over Muktar, Muslim’s former student at the pesantren. Aceh Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Yusuf Al Qardawi affirmed that Muslim had never been involved in the terrorist group, but did not deny that Muktar had links to the Aceh terrorist group after Muktar confessed the weapons found in his house were entrusted to him by Maulana, a suspect who escaped during a raid in Lamkabeu, Aceh Besar. “Maulana entrusted the firearms to Muktar because he did not know where else to hide them,” Yusuf said. Yusuf said the terror activities in Aceh were lead by the radical Mujahidin group in Asia, which planned to set up its training ground in Aceh as a center for Asia. He said the group had chosen Aceh believing that, because of its Islamic sharia law, it would be easier to influence. Some of the group’s members now being hunted by police are believed to have been recruited by Aceh FPI as jihad volunteers to be sent to Palestine in early 2009. “But we failed to send them because of the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel,” Yusuf said. Three of the volunteers who had graduated from the training camp and joined the armed group in Aceh were identified as Taufik, Abu Rimba and Abu Rencong — all Aceh residents currently on the police’s most-wanted list for their alleged involvement in the Jamaah Islamiyah terrorist network. Meanwhile, observers have suggested the recent crackdown on terrorism may be part of a government efforts to distract the public attention from the high-profile Bank Century investigations. “I believe the police knew the terrorists’ whereabouts a long time ago. Why have they only decided to exploit this issue in public now?” University of Indonesia lecturer Boni Hargens said at the Regional Representatives Council (DPD) on Wednesday. “The crackdown on terrorists  must not be used to cover up political sins.” House of Representatives defense commission member Hidayat Nur Wahid from the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) told the police to crush terror cells immediately to prevent speculation on political interests behind police operations.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/03/18/antiterror-raid-police-arrest-two-more-suspects-aceh.html,,2010
"Thu, March 18 2010","Court told to be firm on rowdiness, intimidating visitors","The Constitutional Court must be firm on members of hard-line Islamic groups who intimidated petitioners of the blasphemy law judicial review by issuing threats and shouting religious slogans during hearing sessions, activists said Tuesday. “There were threats against [the supporters of the review] outside the courtroom,” M. Choirul Anam, a lawyer for petitioners, told The Jakarta Post. “While protests in the courtroom were intimidating.” Anam said the hard-liners, mostly from the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), who opposed the rights activists’ move, continually attended hearings and often yelled at those testifying in support of the judicial review, calling them “infidels” and telling them to “repent”. “The court has the authority to take strict action against these people,” he said. “It has the authority to expel them from the courtroom.” A number of activists and self-proclaimed supporters of pluralism filed the request for a judicial review of the 1965 blasphemy law last year. The move was mainly triggered by the government banning of the Ahmadiyah group, regarded by mainstream Muslims as heretical. The law’s articles in scrutiny stipulate the government’s authority to dissolve religious groups whose beliefs and practices are deemed as blasphemous by religious authorities such as the Religious Affairs Ministry and the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI). According to petitioners, the law was discriminatory of certain religious groups, which have been denied their right to worship according to their beliefs. Anam said the Court was firm in its approach at the first session of the hearings, with Court chief Mahfud M.D. asking loud visitors, dominated by FPI members, to quieten. “But the Court has not been as firm of late,” he said. “We suspect that the judges are intimidated by the protestors in the courtroom.” Choirul said activists were apprehensive the Court could not issue a fair ruling because judges were intimidated. Hearing sessions on the blasphemy law at the Constitutional Court have often been rife with cacophony from the gallery. Ulil Abshar Abdalla, an expert supporting the review, reportedly received death threats from the gallery at Court. Mahendradatta of Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia, an Islamic group opposing the review, dismissed the belief that the Court’s ruling would be influenced by intimidation from visitors. “The Court will not be intimidated,” he said. He insisted that the actions of protesters at the Court had not breached misconduct. “It is tolerable. The judges have not had to expel anyone from the courtroom.”",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/03/18/court-told-be-firm-rowdiness-intimidating-visitors.html,,2010
"Thu, March 25 2010",Experts insist blasphemy law undermines freedom,"Critically acclaimed cinematographer and cultural observer Garin Nugroho, who testified as an expert in a hearing of the judicial review request of the 45-year-old Blasphemy Law on Wednesday, said the law discouraged people from discussing religious issues. “It is the biggest setback in the history of this nation in terms of democracy and its agenda for pluralism,” said Garin, whose controversial interpretation of a Hindu epic in his piece Shinta Obong drew rebukes from a Hindu youth organization. “Several articles in the law have vague interpretations. This law has the potential to side with the majority to the detriment of minorities,”  he said. Cole Durham, a professor of law at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, USA, said in his testimony that the law failed the necessity test in several respects. Apart from discriminating against certain groups, Durham said via teleconference, the language used in the law was vague and therefore left open the possibility of arbitrary application. “When ‘deviation’ from the tenets of a religion occurs, or when one ‘resembles’ another excessively, it is far from clear to ordinary citizens,” he added. He was testifying as an expert on behalf of petitioners. He highlighted that while desecration of sacred objects was frowned upon and reflected modern societies’ poverty of spirit, “it is equally important to remember that, except in most repressive regimes, apostasy and heresy fall under religious, not civil, jurisdiction”. “Invoking the machinery of the state to carry out recriminations is extremely dangerous, both because of the unpredictable consequences it may unleash, and also because the empowered state may create other problems, even for the prevailing groups,” he added. Former justice and human rights minister Yusril Ihza Mahendra, who testified as an expert presented by the court, challenged Durham’s view, saying the law had become a means to prevent interreligious conflict in Indonesia. Violence marred Wednesday’s hearing at the Constitutional Court — the last hearing before the court issues a ruling next month — when members of the hard-line Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) intimidated lawyers of the petitioners, calling on them to drop their bid to repeal the law. Bystanders began taking pictures, further enraging FPI members, who attacked three men, yelling “Erase the pictures”. One of the men attacked was Novel, a member of the Indonesian Communion of Churches (PGI), who had come to the hearing to assist expert witness SAE Nababan who testified at the hearing. He captured several pictures and video clips of the incident. “I was slapped, kicked and punched in the stomach when a huge crowd chased me up the ramp leading to the first floor. One of them tried to strangle me,” he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/03/25/experts-insist-blasphemy-law-undermines-freedom.html,,2010
"Sat, March 27 2010",Hard-liners force out sex congress participants,"Members of hard-line Islamic groups forced their way into a Surabaya hotel Friday, demanding participants of a planned congress on sexual orientation in the East Java city to leave the country by Sunday. The police took no action against the move, condemned by politicians and activists as “unconstitutional” and violating human rights, who said the conference should be seen as “a celebration of democracy and human rights”. Dozens of foreign participants from Mexico, Canada, the US and 13 Asian countries were scheduled to take part in the 4th regional Lesbian, Gay, Transgender and Intersex Association (ILGA) conference scheduled to run from Friday to Sunday. But the organizer decided Thursday to officially cancel the event, citing “security reasons”, after the police refused to grant them a permit fearing protests from religious groups. Secretary-general of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) in East Java, Mohammad Chaeruddin, said the foreigners were told to leave because Surabaya Muslims believed the conference was against religious values and teachings. “We forced them to return home  by Sunday. We also told them not to make a media statement,” he told The Jakarta Post on Friday. The group also entered several hotels in Surabaya and nearby Malang, including Mercure Surabaya where the conference was scheduled to be held on Thursday. They also urged hotels to make a written statement refusing to host the conference. On Friday at 3 p.m., FPI members, the Islamic Community Forum and the Indonesian Ulemas Council arrived at Oval Hotel. Hundreds more from the Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia, which held a rally protesting gay, lesbian and transexual communities outside Grahadi Surabaya, arrived later. South Surabaya Police chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Bahagia Dachi, said the police would ensure the safety of conference participants, including foreigners. “We’ll provide security escorts for foreigners to Juanda Airport Surabaya,” he said. Surabaya’s Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence coordinator, Andy Irfan Junaidi, criticized the police for allowing religious groups to undermine and violate the rights of minority groups. “Religious groups have prevented the groups to gather, against the guarantee of the Constitution,” he said. Separately in Jakarta, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s Democratic Party politicians have called the police banning of a planned gay and lesbian congress in East Java as “unconstitutional”. “[Holding a congress] is a basic human right,” Benny Kabur Harman, House of Representatives’ justice and human rights commission chairman, said Friday. “Gays and lesbians are citizens whose political and legal rights are guaranteed and protected by the Constitution, which allows freedom of opinion. “The state should in no way forbid the congress from being held.” Benny’s colleague, Pieter Zulkifli, said the congress should be seen as “a celebration of democracy and human rights”. The National Awakening Party (PKB) said the congress must be relocated overseas “for the sake of the country’s moral values”.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/03/27/hardliners-force-out-sex-congress-participants.html,,2010
"Tue, March 30 2010",Issues: Letter: RI is not a Muslim country,"March 22, p. 8 I would like to comment regarding the use of the term “Muslim country” to describe Indonesia. Although this is something that is often done by just about every news source I have seen, read or listened to, including occasionally The Jakarta Post, in this case I refer to the repeated use of the term by a senior reporter for an Indonesian TV channel. It is too personal to say the use of the term “Muslim country” to describe Indonesia is offensive to non-Muslim Indonesians, whose number in recent times has decreased thanks to long-term unjust treatment of East Timor resulting in its separation, or since the 1960s when Indonesians were forced to choose one of only five religions, and especially considering the fact that non-Muslims also fought for our independence. My objection is simply the fact that constitutionally Indonesia is not a Muslim-country. I believe the correct term is a “Muslim-majority” country. My objection is the fact that the reporter is not someone who no one respects or listens to, and is not someone whose profession does not oblige him to report accurately using accurate terminology. Using accurate words to describe ourselves is essential to preserving an accurate perception of our identity. (By John Paul, Jakarta) Your comments: How is Indonesia not a Muslim country? Isn’t it 90 percent Muslim? Is that not an overwhelming amount of people who culturally adhere to a certain way of thinking and can thus as a nation be described generally as Muslim? If you compare Indonesia to a truly cosmopolitan country like Australia, which is made up of an overwhelming number of different ethnicities, religions and belief systems, why bother to specify Indonesia as a “Muslim-majority country”. Even if Australia was 90 percent white, who would bother to say a “white majority country”? Clearly it would be white and people would of course know that doesn’t mean everyone. And please, let’s not pretend that the constitution dominates the socio-political landscape when the police in Surabaya just banned an international gay and lesbian convention. Indonesia is a Muslim country. Muslim beliefs guide social consciousness. Lauren Palembang We should not use religious or idealistic terminology to describe any country as it creates a hindrance to people of differing faiths living in RI. RI, like its neighbors Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and even Thailand is mostly multi-racial and multi-cultural. This is a fact that cannot be disputed. It doesn’t mean that if for example Singapore is majority Chinese that it’s classed as a Taoist or Buddhist country or in the case of the Philippines or even Italy we should classify it as Catholic country. There is simply no such thing. And John I agree with your view that RI should be described as “Muslim-majority” country. Good point! One last point, majority simply means more than others. It doesn’t mean the majority owns all others! L Tan Batam, Riau Island John Paul is correct! Indonesia is not a Muslim Country. Indonesia is a Muslim-majority country. Indonesia is a pluralist country with peoples of different ethnic backgrounds, beliefs and race. Daniel Emerson Indianapolis, US If Indonesia is not a Muslim country, then why do they have a religious section of the government, why does the government allow a province (Aceh) to operate under Muslim (Sharia) law and why are Muslim groups like the FPI allowed to create havoc in the name of Islam? To the world, it is indeed a Muslim country. Exbrit Probolinggo, East Java Many times, when there is a news report on Indonesia, the terms “biggest Muslim-majority country”, or the “biggest Muslim country” are mentioned (as if it is a synonym for Indonesia). I was also a bit bothered by this term, yet not from the same perspective of Mr. John Paul. This term is being mentioned over and over again, every time there is a report about a terrorist attack, or where there is a report on any sensitive political and religious issue (usually in a negative manner, which could provoke the feelings of one group or the other). Why do we never hear the terms “biggest Christian country”, “the biggest Buddhist country”, or “the biggest Hindu country” in the news reported inside, and outside Indonesia? The irritating factor is that this term is more used by the Indonesian media, addressed to Indonesians, or foreigners who already know much about the country. Mohamed Jakarta The Pancasila, which is the so-called “philosophy” upon which the Indonesian so-called “republic” was founded, starts with something like: Everybody believes in a single god. That just means Indonesia is a religious state, one that claims its faith in monotheism. Whether this is an Islamic, Christian or Jewish state does not matter, since the God of all these three religions is the same and was created about 3,000 years ago. The Jewish religion is not accepted in Indonesia (I wonder why), but basically it is the same as the two other monotheist religions. The two other official religions of Indonesia are Hinduism and Buddhism, which are not monotheist, in contradiction with principle no. 1 of Pancasila. This is one of the many contradictions and confusions you should start to think about. My last point is how can a nation based on such confused principles survive?

"Sat, April 10 2010",Lesbians face double discrimination,"Families can do twisted things on learning their daughter or sibling is a lesbian. A brother would force his butch lesbian sister to perform oral sex in an attempt to “educate her”. A mother would hire a gigolo so that her daughter would know the “pleasure” of men. The sexologist her mother brought her would grope her, asking whether she felt any excitement. Families would force femme lesbians into marriages the latter did not want. These examples are the stories that came to the LBT (Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender) advocacy and research organization, the Ardhanary Institute, from women who have been abused because of their sexual orientation. The director of Ardhanary Institute, RR. Sri Agustine, said recently at her office that violence toward the LBT individuals that came to Ardhanary’s crisis center was mostly carried out within the private sphere of the family home. “At times, the home that is supposed to be the safest place becomes the most dangerous place. The most common type of violence is sexual abuse, especially toward butch females, by brothers, uncles, fathers who suspect the sexual orientation and wanted to ‘set them straight’,” she said. “Femme lesbians would be forced into marriages because of the stigma of becoming an old spinster attached to unmarried woman,” she added. “A lesbian, who had been married for 13 years after being forced into it by her family, said she felt she had been raped for 13 years,” Agustine said. The problem is compounded, she said, with the discrimination against LBT people by the state. The police force is yet to be sensitive toward crimes carried out on the basis of sexual orientation discrimination. Agustine said a police office, upon hearing that a rape victim was a lesbian, said: “No wonder you’ve been raped, you’re a lesbian”. Victims of violence or sexual abuse would prefer to settle the problem without the help of the police. Or if they did report it to the police, did not say that the crime was related to their sexual orientation, Agustine said. In Indonesia, entering the third decade of the gay movement, discrimination and oppression against homosexuals is still rife. Recently, intimidation from a hard-line religious group forced organizers of the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) Asia to cancel their conference in Surabaya, and the police did nothing to stop it. For lesbian, bisexual and transgender women, their battle is twice that of their gay male counterparts. According to LGBT rights expert Baden Offord, Indonesian lesbians face double discrimination in terms of gender and sexual orientation. “The Indonesian lesbian movement has a long way to go to bring about visibility and tolerance in the wider society,” he said through an email interview. Compared to the transgender and gay movement, the lesbian movement in Indonesia is more discreet and less explicit. Agustine said this was due to the patriarchal culture in society. “In the context of patriarchal culture, society teaches women to be passive and not active. “There are more rules given to women. If a woman is yet to be married at a certain age, society labels her a spinster. This has made the LBT group more closed. If they came out, the family would be more ashamed,” she said. “For gay men, society is more tolerant of them and of transvestites, because men have a place in public life. For lesbians, women have the traditional role of domestic life, to be a housewife and to be a ‘good woman’,” she said. Agustine said she told lesbian women to claim their space. “Be more educated, show society that we can contribute something,” she said. Ardhanary works with different LBT groups across Indonesia, creating a vast network and support group. In the Internet era, it is now easier for LBT individuals to find their community. Mailing lists, Internet forums and social networking sites such as Facebook have become an avenue for LBT people to meet and share stories. Non-political lesbian movements have also used the Internet as their media. Online magazine sepocikopi.com is one example, in which the articles are written by and aimed at lesbians. “SepociKopi is actually its own movement. We chose to ‘fight’ — not out — but in. How we view ourselves as humans and not conceptualize ourselves as marginalized,” Alex, SepociKopi editor-in-chief wrote in an email. “We believe in the power of words to light the path for lesbians when things seem dark and confusing. We’re not pushing lesbians to come out. We have a lot of articles that shows the pros and cons of coming out. But if they do want to, we push for them to do it in a positive way: to be a successful and high-achieving woman — who is coincidentally a lesbian,” she said. Utari, a bisexual, said the sense of community did help her from being isolated and lonely. “No one around me that I know of is like me. It felt really lonely,” she said. Upon finding SepociKopi, Utari, 25, contributed to the website as well. She has come out to her then boyfriend and later to a friend in the last year. “I think by coming out, I became more accepting of myself, because I could tell someone who accepted me as I am,” she said. Agustine said the younger generation of lesbians was more open and educated. Sources of information are more readily available to them compared to the older generations of lesbians. Since the reform era and the rise of the women’s movement in Indonesia, the lesbian movement in Indonesia, Agustine said, had become more inclusive, aligning themselves with the Indonesian women’s movement, such as Komnas Perempuan and Koalisi Perempuan Indonesia. However, not all women’s groups were accepting of the lesbian movement, Agustine said. Gay rights champion and founder of the first gay movement GAYa Nusantara Dede Oetomo said that, despite resistance, the incident of March 26, where the FPI harassed the ILGA organizers, showed that the LBT movement should join forces with any willing civil society elements “Working with the women’s movement is clearly a logical choice even though there is resistance here and there. History in other countries and regions shows the same thing. However, the women’s movement is progressing, especially with the younger activists who are more open to sexual and reproductive rights discourses,” he said. Lawmaker and human rights activist Nursyahbani Katjasungkana said up to now there had been no breakthroughs in legislation on the protection of the rights of sexual minorities. She said she had fought for the rights of sexual minorities to be included in the legislation with legislator Eva Sundari during the drafting of the anti-racial discrimination bill and the citizens’ administration bill. Both of the bills eventually passed into law witout including the rights of sexual minorities. The anti-pornography law, in its definition section, states that being lesbian and gay, and sodomy, were sexual deviations. And in Aceh, a bylaw, regulates that homosexuality can be punishable by stoning to death. Nusyahbani said the discourse for the rights of sexual minorities had been pushed forward, but recent developments such as the anti-pornography law and the bylaw in Aceh had brought setbacks. “LGBT groups are our social reality. They cannot be eliminated in the name of anything. Aren’t they God’s creatures as well?” she said. Lesbian world: A woman reads a lesbian online magazine.

"Mon, April 19 2010",Court beefs up security ahead of ruling,"To prepare for possible clashes when it announces its verdict on a judicial review petition on the Blasphemy Law, the Constitutional Court is beefing up security at the building. The court’s general bureau chief, Noor Sidharta, told The Jakarta Post on Sunday that he had requested Jakarta Police deploy 500 officers to guard the court building complex this afternoon when judges will read out their much-awaited verdict. Previous hearings of the controversial judicial review request of the law were guarded by 300 officers. “We learned from [the incident] the other day. Now we are preparing twice the usual number of police officers,” Noor said, referring to an altercation during recess at the last hearing between followers of the hard-line Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) and several members of a team of lawyers for the petitioners. Officials fear violence could break out, especially in the wake of last week’s deadly brawl in Koja, North Jakarta, where the FPI and other organizations joined hundreds of local residents in street battles with security officers over an Islamic shrine. FPI supporters also attacked activists from the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion who had gathered at Monas Park in the middle of 2008. The activists were conducting a peace rally supporting religious pluralism. A court found an FPI leader guilty of the violence and sentenced him to 18 months in prison. Muslim scholar Azyumardi Azra warned of a repeat of the attacks by hard-line groups.“Those involved in any demonstrations should refrain from breaking the law,” he said. He also called on the police to be extra vigilant. “Those [hard-line] organizations have leaders. The police have to grow a pair and take action against them if they get violent. Don’t let them walk away without being held responsible for their deeds. If police let them off the hook, they will keep doing it,” he told the Post. He criticized the fact that members of Muslim organizations were too easily mobilized in the name of Islam. Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the country’s largest Muslim organization, is among those who have voiced concern over possible violence if the court rules in favor of the petitioners and repeals the 45-year-old law. “Violence should not be a means to force one’s viewpoint on others. Everyone has to view the ruling with an open mind, regardless of the ruling,” Masdar Farid Mas’udi, a member of NU’s lawmaking body, said. Indonesians, Masdar added, trusted the court to solve the legal dispute, so “we must respect its decisions”. Islamic organization Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) said it would not stage a rally ahead of Monday’s ruling, although it would object to a ruling in favor of the petitioners. “We understand the [court’s] decision will be based on facts presented in the hearings,” HTI spokesman Ismail Yusanto said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/04/19/court-beefs-security-ahead-ruling.html,,2010
"Wed, April 21 2010",A nervous first day back on the streets,"With the dust yet to settle in Koja, North Jakarta, and bitter resentment toward public order officers still in the air, the administration announced Tuesday its officers would resume working after a week-long of hiatus. “The officers will join the morning ceremony at every municipality on Wednesday [today],” Jakarta administration spokesman Cucu Ahmad Kurnia said Tuesday. Provincial administration public order officers will join a ceremony at National Monument Park in Central Jakarta, as usual. The announcement came when several parents of teenagers injured in the bloody Koja clash filed complaints to the National Commission for Human Rights (Komnas HAM) over officers’ alleged violation of human rights in the incident. The Jakarta Post also talked to several officers in Central Jakarta who asked to be quoted on condition of anonymity, expressing their fear of wearing their uniforms. “There has been rumors that members of FPI [Islam Defenders Front] and  FBR [Betawi Brotherhood Forum] will [target] us. That’s why we are still wearing plainclothes today,” an officer said. Cucu confirmed the threats. “They have received threats sent via text message,” he said. Cucu said public order officers earlier had temporarily ceased their daily monitoring of the streets because many were still traumatized from the clash, which resulted in the deaths of three of their colleagues. At least 128 people were also injured in the clash. Meanwhile, FPI Jakarta chief Salim bin Umar Alatas played down the news that his members would target public order officers. “If our members [target officers], let the police arrest them,” Salim said. He added that the officers faced hatred from residents owing to their inhumane treatment while conducting raids on street vendors and slum dwellers. After the fatal clash in the Mbah Priuk memorial complex last Wednesday, most streets in the city were left unguarded by officers. Most street vendors were pleased at the outcome. “[The officers] have trodden on us for long time. We are all afraid of them, but we can’t fight back. They often eat here without paying,” said Aji, who runs a food stall on Jl. Sabang, Central Jakarta. Many vendors had to play a game of cat-and-mouse with the officers, Aji said. The number of street vendors next to Tanah Abang train station also increased since last week. Supri, an ojek (motorcycle taxi) driver in Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta, said he was annoyed when he got trapped in traffic jams because of street vendors blocking the road. However, he said he felt sorry for the vendors when he saw public order officers confiscating their carts. “Why couldn’t the officers just ask the vendors to move? Why did they have to be rude and take their carts and stuff?” he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/04/21/a-nervous-first-day-back-streets.html,,2010

Net Medan There are two lessons learned: The municipal administration should improve their public communication skills in dealing with such problems.

Why is there is so much commotion involved when it comes to religious matters? Why do people get so emotional when a religious figure’s grave is to be moved? Why didn’t people get outraged at the government when the Bank Century scandal exploded. Why is there no fight going on for the mudflow victims? Why are people not rebelling against the new corruption cases involving tax official Gayus Tambunan, etc. Why are people not questioning how Tommy Soeharto was released when he was supposed to be in prison for eight years? Why was Ibu Minah punished for 60 days when she just committed a petty crime? It is very easy to fight for unnecessary things, but too difficult to fight for good things. People get emotional when it comes to religion. And this is what all the political leaders take advantage of. This is their weapon. They are not political people, but many in the name of religion take advantage of people and exploit the human resources which could have been used for the betterment of humans and society.

"Thu, April 22 2010",Public order officers timid on first day back,"The city administration said that its public order officers had resumed normal duties Wednesday following a rest period after last week’s deadly clash in Koja, North Jakarta. However, there was little evidence of their activity in the capital on their first day back on the job, in large part because many were working incognito. Public Order Agency vans and trucks that usually sit parked at busy intersections and markets, such as in Slipi and Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta, and Jatinegara, in East Jakarta, were nowhere to be seen. Scores of 3-in-1 jockeys lined Jl. Asia-Afrika in Senayan unchallenged as they waited to be picked up and paid by cars in need of extra passengers to comply with the rush-hour 3-in-1 car-pooling regulation. Head of the Public Order Agency protection unit, Heru Joko Santoso, said his men were still traumatized by last week’s violence. “Yes, we resumed working and doing our duty, but we have yet to become fully operational as many of our members continue to suffer from mental trauma,” Heru said. Three people died when hundreds of public order officers clashed with defenders of a sacred monument in Koja during a land-clearing operation, all from the agency. The latest release from the Indonesian Red Cross on Tuesday said that 173 people were injured in the fight, 90 of them public order officers. Heru tried to lift the morale of his officers at a morning ceremony at the National Monument Park by reminding them they were protected by law and state. “Now let us rise and shine again. The sweep is just a rumor. Do not be afraid,” Heru said to his officers in the park, referring to a rumor that members of the Islam Defenders’ Front (FPI) and the Betawi Brotherhood Forum were planning attacks against the officers as revenge for the Koja violence. Heru said that the officers had requested that they not have to wear their blue-brown uniforms, but he added that he had been assured by  FPI Jakarta chief Salim bin Umar Alatas that the FPI would not target agency officers. In North Jakarta, officers took advantage of Kartini Day celebrations to relinquish their uniforms in favor of traditional Betawi clothes. “Today, we did not hold a morning ceremony. Instead, we held a spiritual session during which we asked an ulema to help heal the officers of their trauma,”  North Jakarta Mayor Bambang Sugiyono told The Jakarta Post via text message. In Central Jakarta, officers wore their normal blue uniforms, but were dispatched to the streets. “Today, our group commander only assigned us to monitor the National Monument park because the number of illegal vendors has been increasing,” said one officer, Roni.

"Sun, April 25 2010","The Week in Review: Mob rules, (not) okay","If you can’t get what you want by legal means, why not form a mob? Two recent incidents in the space of a week suggest that mob power is the easiest and surest way of getting what you want in this country. The worst part is that the mobs seem to be getting away with their violent crimes. There goes Indonesia’s claim to being a democracy based on the rule of law. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has his work cut out for him. He not only has to deal with the judicial mafia that has corrupted our courts, but he now also has to deal with real mobs who are making a complete mockery of our justice system. Thursday’s riot in a dockyard on the industrial island of Batam, south of Singapore, showed how destructive the power of the mob could be. Three people were injured, the dockyard facility was razed and scores of cars were destroyed as thousands of workers ran amok in angry reaction to a reported racial slur by an expatriate Indian worker at the Dubai-based dockyard company. The Indian expat, who was subsequently beaten and attacked by his Indonesian workers, may have been a bigot, but the workers who went not only after him but also after dozens of other Indian workers at the plant indiscriminately, proved that they were the true racists, and violent ones at that. Their actions spooked other foreigners working and living in Batam and many of them fled to Singapore. Time will tell if the violence has only limited impact, as officials claim, or a deeper one on foreign investors’ confidence. The way the authorities handle the case will be important in determining their attitude. What we are hearing so far is not convincing. The Indian expat, who is nursing his wounds in hospital, is wanted by police for questioning and will likely be charged and probably deported. What about those who waged the physical attacks and massive destruction? The police have already warned the company against dismissing the Indonesian workers involved in the riot. Are they protecting the criminals? We have barely recovered from the shock of the bloody unrest a week earlier in Koja district, North Jakarta, where security officers clashed with a mob deployed to defend an old cemetery that has been turned into a shrine. Three members of the city’s Public Order Agency were killed and dozens of others injured in the unrest. The table has been turned upside down. The public order officers, notorious for their violent methods in evicting people in land disputes, were at the receiving end of violence this time. As if that wasn’t enough, the head of the agency was dismissed in the wake of the riot. Now Jakarta Governor Fauzi Bowo is under pressure to disband the unit. But what action is being taken against the mob, which proved that it can be even deadlier than the most violent public order officer, and the people who instigated it? Zilch. On the contrary, not only has the city administration backed off from its plan to demolish the cemetery, which is within its rights since it is located within its property, but it has also succumbed to demands from the shrine owners to turn the place into a protected national heritage site. The shrine, like many old cemeteries in Indonesia, is frequented by people who come to pray for good fortune from the deity. Logic, reason and common sense have gone out of the window to make way for emotional, irrational and violent behaviors and beliefs. It seems that we are regressing from “enlightening the lives of the people of the nation” that our constitution mandates. *** Mob power may have influenced the Constitutional Court’s decision to reject a petition to repeal the 1965 Blasphemy Law, which many religious minorities and small Islamic sects say violates their freedom of religion. The Islam Defenders Front (FPI), notorious for its violent demonstrations, deployed its members to the court to ensure that the ruling went their way. Sure enough, the court defended the blasphemy law and a commotion was prevented, but the ruling left a sour aftertaste among followers of minority religions who viewed, rightly or wrongly, that the court succumbed to the intimidations of the mob. The Blasphemy Law has been invoked by certain mainstream Muslim organizations to outlaw Islamic sects they deem “deviant” (including, recently, the Jamaah Ahmadiyah) or send individuals to jail for behavior they find offensive, including one imam who conducted his prayers in Bahasa Indonesia rather than in Arabic. By upholding the law, the court effectively emboldened the likes of the FPI to torment and intimidate other religious minorities, of course always in the name of God. So more power to the mob, it seems. If the Constitutional Court, the last bastion of justice, cannot be counted upon to protect religious minorities and guarantee religious freedom, who can? God save Indonesia from those who wage war on others in his name. — Endy M. Bayuni",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/04/25/the-week-review-mob-rules-not-okay.html,,2010
"Sat, May 1 2010",FPI sabotages transgender workshop,"Dozens of members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) stormed a human rights training program intended for transgender individuals at a hotel in Depok, West Java, on Friday. The program, organized by the National Commission for Human Rights (Komnas HAM), had just begun when dozens of FPI members forced their way (past police) into the room. Nancy Iskandar, a participant, said after a coffee break at around 10:30 a.m, a number of police officers had come into the room. The committee had then asked participants to take a snack break in the training room. “Several people then suddenly banged on the door and shouted the name of God,” she said. Nancy, who is also the head of the Transgender Communication Forum, said the group verbally assaulted participants disgracefully. The commission immediately moved the participants to its headquarters in Menteng, Central Jakarta, in the afternoon to ensure their safety. Lupi, another participant from Bali, sobbed when she said it was really sad and ironic that their right to hold social activities were deprived when they were learning about human rights. “Transgender people are not trash. “We earn a living in a decent way for our families and send our brothers and sisters to school,” she said. Depok Police questioned five security officers as witnesses following the sabotage. Depok Police detective unit chief Comr. Ade Rahmat said they summon members of the FPI who were involved in the attack. “If it is proved they attacked the event, we will take legal action against them,” he said. Police said the attackers thought the workshop was a beauty pageant. Ade said police were already on site when the group had entered the hotel to protest the event, but failed to stop them entering the room. “We were outnumbered. We did not expect them to attack, so [the event] had to be stopped,” Ade said. The event’s trustee, Hesty Armiwulan, criticized Depok Police for its sluggish response in safeguarding the event, allowing attackers to enter the room. “Transgender people are marginalized and vulnerable. This training program was meant to make them feel safer and empowered, and this incident only made them more afraid,” she said. Hesty said the three-day program, which was initially scheduled to end Saturday, was solely for educational purposes. “On Friday night, we were planning to hold a little ceremony to give an award to the best participant,” she said, adding that there was no pageant. Twenty-five people were at the workshop. Hesty said that despite the incident the commission was committed to resuming its training program. She said she had worked with Depok Police to assure their safety at the hotel on Saturday. “The topic of this program should be taught thoroughly to provide its participants with a thorough understanding of human rights,” Komnas HAM education and training member Hesty said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/01/fpi-sabotages-transgender-workshop.html,,2010
"Sun, May 2 2010",Victims to be summoned over violence,"Police have not arrested any members of a hardline Islamic group who stormed a human rights training session for transgender individuals, but instead plan to summon the victims. “We are handling this matter carefully to avoid social tension,” Depok Police detective chief Comr. Ade Rahmat said Saturday, adding that police had questioned six of the organizers of the training program. “We plan to summon the  program leader on Monday,” Ade said. “We know the Muslim fundamentalist movement in Depok is strong. [Friday’s] incident was instigated by the Islam Defenders Front [FPI],” he said. The National Commission of Human Rights (Komnas HAM) was conducting a three-day program to train transgender groups on human rights at a Depok hotel when dozens of FPI members broke into the training room after a coffee break, destroyed some property and assaulted participants. The FPI members attacked a participant from the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation who was to speak at the event, while other participants suffered injuries from broken glass, according to participating organization Arus Pelangi. The FPI has a long, mostly unpunished criminal record of usually violent raids, including raids on nightspots in Jakarta, usually conducted during the fasting month of Ramadhan. The hardliners were also involved in unconstitutional assaults to force the closure of houses of worships belonging to religious minorities in some areas across the country. The FPI was also involved in an incident with a group from the National Alliance for the Freedom of Religion and Faith (AKKBB) in June 2008 in the National Monument (Monas) Park. “We were also threatened by public order officers who came to the hotel at 9:30 p.m. and told us to stop the training,”  organizer Hesty Armiwulan from Komnas HAM said. Hesty added the public order commander, Sariyo had said organizers did not have permission from Depok authorities to hold the meeting. “But I insisted on continuing since we did not commit any crime or create public disturbances during the event,” she said. However, Hesty continued, at 10 p.m. electricity in the room was suddenly switched off, but participants continued even with dimmed lights and without a microphone. “The police officers who were guarding the premises following the [illegal] FPI incident in the morning did not seem to  bother to stop them,” Hesty said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/02/victims-be-summoned-over-violence.html,,2010

"Tue, May 4 2010",FPI radicals remain free after assault,"Three days after the unruly Islam Defenders Front (FPI) stormed a human rights training workshop for transgender individuals in Depok, West Java, police seem reluctant to pursue the case further, with no arrests made to date. Despite massive media reports covering the Friday attack and the presence of several police officers at the crime scene, police investigations have made little progress, despite apparent evidence of the perpetrators. “We were planning to question several witnesses today, but no one showed up,” Depok Police detectives chief Comr. Ade Rahmat Idnal said Monday. The witnesses Ade was referring to were the workshop organizers and members of FPI. The workshop, jointly organized by the National Commission for Human Rights (Komnas HAM) and the Indonesian Transgender Communication Forum (FKWI), had just begun when dozens of FPI activists forced their way into the room past several police officers, banging on the door and repeatedly shouting the name of God. They also accused the organizers of holding a transsexual beauty pageant at the hotel. As well as destroying some of the hotel’s property, the extremists also reportedly assaulted one participant from the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation who was due to speak at the event. A number of police officers were already on site when the group entered the hotel to protest the event, but failed to stop them from entering the room since the officers were outnumbered. Both FKWI and Komnas HAM condemned the way police handled the case. “A number of police officers witnessed the attack. How come they needed us to come and explain what had happened,” FKWI western region chief Merlyn Sopjan told The Jakarta Post on Monday. Workshop organizer Hesti Armiwulan from Komnas HAM also doubted that police would be serious in handling the case. “It should be [the FPI members] who are first brought to face legal proceedings,” Hesti said, adding that the commission would submit a detailed report on the attack to the police on Tuesday. Separately, FPI Depok chapter head Habib Idrus Al Gadhri invited police to summon his members should the police want to question them about the incident. ”Of course we are ready,” he said. The FPI has a long, mostly unpunished criminal record of often violent raids, including on nightspots in Jakarta, often conducted during the fasting month of Ramadan. The group has also often been involved in unconstitutional assaults to force the closure of houses of worship belonging to religious minorities in many areas across Indonesia. Veteran human rights activist Hendardi, who currently chairs the Setara Institute for Democracy and Peace, criticized the police, which he said seemed powerless against the unlawful assaults committed by the hard-line group. Criminal Code rulings possibly violated by FPI Article 160: “Any person who orally or in writing incites in public to commit a punishable act, a violent action against the public authority or any other disobedience, either to a statutory provision or to an official order issued under a statutory provision, shall be punished by a maximum imprisonment of six years or a maximum fine of three hundreds Rupiahs.” Article 170 clause (1): Person who with united forces openly commit violence against persons of property, shall be punished by a maximum imprisonment of five years and six months. Article 310 clause (1): The person who intentionally harms someone’s honor or reputation by charging him with certain fact, with the obvious intent to give publicity thereof, shall, being guilty of slander, be punished by a maximum imprisonment of nine months or a maximum fine of three hundred Rupiahs.

"Wed, May 5 2010",Stop! In the name of love,"Do you remember Stop! In the Name of Love, the 1965 hit single by Diana Ross and the Supremes? It’s about a woman who discovers her man is two-timing her. She implores him to stop, “in the name of love … before you break my heart”. It seems that the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI, Front Pembela Islam), have a new take on this song. The difference is that it’s not love but violence, and what they’re breaking is not hearts, but other people’s rights, not to mention the law – and it looks like neither love or anything else can stop them! In fact, their most recent target was a three-day human rights training workshop for waria (transgender people) held in Depok last Friday (April 30, 2010). The event was organized by the National Human Rights Commission, a government agency, and was part of a routine program educating various social groups about human rights. Dozens of violent FPI members stormed the hotel where the workshop was being held, invoking the name of God, destroying property and assaulting participants. The commission had to stop the event and moved it to their headquarters in Central Jakarta. Bizarrely, that evening it was the public order officers of Depok Municipality who stopped the waria pageant. Hello? Whose side are they on anyway? The Depok attack followed in the footsteps of an even more aggressive assault on the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Association (ILGA) conference in Surabaya on March 26-28 this year (http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/mn8fXAD1Ao). The aggressors were from the Unity Front of the Community of Islam (FPUI), an ad hoc coalition of seven conservative groups, including the FPI, the increasingly hardline Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) and Hizbut Tahrir. FPUI thugs forced themselves into the Oval Hotel where the conference was held, and occupied it —including participants rooms! Incidents such as these always leave me scratching my head for many reasons. Why, for example, are hardliners so threatened by alternative sexualities when homosexuality is a standard, even institutionalized, feature of many Islamic boarding schools? And why are these white-robed, skull-capped men so freaked out by waria? They are a common, even traditional feature of Indonesian society, and unlike the FPI, they have never caused harm to anyone. Perhaps the hardliners have been watching Ali Saleem, a.k.a. Begum Nawazish Ali, a transgender talk-show host who is also Pakistan’s biggest TV star (http://www.youtube.co/watch?v=d1Z4m1HxUoA&feature=related). You see, it’s not just gender that Pakistan’s Dame Edna is bending, but social and political taboos as well. Dame Edna is famous for being the hostess-with-the-mostess, with a sharp political edge. Despite the controversies, s/he’s admired and respected by the general public for her/his honesty and courage. Saleem is a man who dresses as a woman — and a beautiful and glamorous one at that. But despite his/her double identity, Saleem is far from double-faced. On the contrary, s/he’s open about sexuality, political views, likes and dislikes — and is blatantly frank about hating hypocrisy. Not surprisingly, the then president, Pervez Musharraf, opposed the show, and it was eventually taken off air. Not for long though: offers came from across the border and Begum, a follow-up show with Indian celebrities, aired 26 episodes. Saleem has since claimed s/he wants to bring peace and harmony between India and Pakistan. S/he says what s/he likes most about India is its democracy, and I’m sure s/he secretly wishes his/her own country could be more like India in this respect. Now, who would you choose? A transgender person such as Ali Saleem who has integrity and ideals — and is funny — or hypocrites such as the hardliner thugs who commit violent, criminal and very unfunny acts?  A no-brainer, huh? In fact, Indonesia’s Religious Affairs Ministry has already named the FPI as one of 70 “misguided” Muslim sects, and they and similar organizations routinely use violence in ways that are clearly prohibited by Indonesian criminal law. Despite this, our police typically drag their feet, and sometimes do  nothing when these gangs break the law. Why? The usual answer is that the police prefer to protect their backsides rather than have a run-in with mobs of violent bullies. Understandable if you are a single cop at the scene perhaps, but they aren’t the only ones routinely buckling under. It now appears to be the default position of the Indonesian state: legislature, executive and judiciary. Just look at the Constitutional Court for example, which recently upheld the pornography and blasphemy laws, and granted the petition of Muslim political parties to strike out affirmative action provisions of the election law. I am perplexed as to why this cowardly attitude prevails, given that political Islam is in steady decline in Indonesia, as national election results repeatedly show. Poor performance at the polls perhaps explains the desperate, clutching-at-straws behavior of Muslim hardliners, who know deep down inside they’re losing, and feel bully-boy tactics are the only leverage they have left.  But why do state authorities — even the President — constantly roll over to them? Could it possibly be because they’re two of a kind? Many of our political leaders and state authorities are just as hypocritical and uncaring about the people as religious hardliners, and as patriarchal. Do they secretly agree with them? In any case, Muslim radicals and government officials alike clearly know very, very little about human rights. That’s why I’m going to suggest to the human rights commission that next time it gives them priority in human rights training! And why not give our votes instead to lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender persons? Not all LGBT people push the boundaries as Ali Saleem does (or are as talented!) but because persecution and discrimination so often comes with being “different”, they do know a lot about human rights. That’s why, like Saleem, they are often good advocates for democracy. They only want to live in peace, be accepted for who they are, and the last thing they want is to provoke social antipathy. Sounds good to me! Maybe their campaign song could be borrowed from The Supremes: “Stop! In the name of love …” The writer (www.juliasuryakusuma.com) is the author of Julia’s Jihad.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/05/stop-in-name-love.html,,2010

Then they came for the liberals, and I did not speak up because I wasn’t a liberal. Then they came for the transgenders, and I did not speak up because I wasn’t a transgender. Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak up for me. David Jakarta It’s a double shame. First, it is a shame that radical organizations like the FPI still exist in the 21st century. But the biggest shame in this case is that the police just looked the other way. Indonesian authorities still mainly look after their own interests, not the interests of those who need protection. At the moment, I cannot see that Indonesia is on the way to becoming a healthy democracy. Markus Hagenauer Germany I guess that in all religious societies people are very indulgent towards religious violence. Indonesia is obviously no different. I always encounter statements like “their intentions are right but they go about it the wrong way”. How can you take stern action against people if you feel “they have good intentions”?

Ahmad Ghozali Majalengka, West Java For some reasons, I don't feel completely surprised with how the Indonesian police handled the issue. The Indonesian police, as with many other government institutions in Indonesia, only work if there is money involved. They don't have the guts to arrest Islamic radicals such as the FPI and other streets gangs in Jakarta. The only people they can easily arrest and harass are the poor, the minorities, and the marginalized people who are often extorted and denied access to justice. Shame on you Indonesian police! If only I had the choice not to pay a cent of tax to the Indonesian government, I would do so.

"Fri, May 7 2010",Police told to be firm on hardliners who assault,"Human rights activists have renewed their call for law enforcers to process hard-line religious groups who have committed a series of assaults on minority groups recently. Veteran human rights activist Hendardi said such groups had enjoyed justification of their violence as the police had displayed a reluctance to process the groups in accordance with the law. “Even if the police arrested members of the groups, such as the Islam Defenders Front [FPI], for assault, they prefer to let attackers walk away, saying an arrest is socially sensitive,” said Hendardi, who currently chairs the Setara Institute for Democracy and Peace. “There’s always a possibility they will use the law as a legal stance to justify their assault,” he said. He referred the recent Constitutional Court decision to uphold the existence of the anti-pornography and blasphemy laws as another instance that could give those hardliners a reason to attack other groups they claim as deviant. Similarly, Edwin Partogi from the Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence said the relationship between the police and hardliners had made things worse. Edwin suspected that it was common to witness police providing leeway to groups to intimidate minority groups. “It is no longer a secret that the police are still wary about non-mainstream movements such as those promoted by transgender, gay or lesbian groups,” he said. “Instead of directly confronting the [minority] groups, the police prefer to let the hard-line groups deal with them in their own way,” he added. On Friday, the hardliners prolonged its track record after storming a human rights workshop jointly organized by the National Commission for Human Rights and the Indonesian Transgender Communication Forum, held at a hotel in Depok. The workshop had just begun when dozens of FPI activists forced their way into the room past several police officers, banging on the meeting room door and shouting the name of God. Despite massive media coverage on the attack and the presence of several police officers at the crime scene, the Depok Police have so far not arrested the attackers and have instead planned to question the workshop organizers. Aside from the FPI, the Betawi Brotherhood Forum and the Islamic Community Forum have an unblemished criminal record for their violent raids on nightspots in Jakarta, usually conducted during the fasting month of Ramadan. The hardliners also involved forcible closure and rallies against the construction of places of worship belonging to religious minorities in some areas across the country. The Jakarta Legal Aid Institute director Nurkholis Hidayat urged the police to immediately impose the law on the attackers. “The leader of the attack must be charged with, at least, Article 160 of the Criminal Code for instigating violent acts, while FPI members can be charged with Article 170 on the destruction of other people’s properties,” he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/07/police-told-be-firm-hardliners-who-assault.html,,2010
"Sat, May 8 2010","Honor democracy, SBY tells Muslims","President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has called on the leaders of the country’s Islamic organizations to maintain the image of Indonesia as nation where Islam, democracy and modernity coexist harmoniously. During the opening of the 5th Indonesian Muslim Congress in Jakarta on Friday, Yudhoyono said the international community had recognized Indonesia as a country where Islam and democracy were compatible, and the country therefore played an important role in leading the Muslim world. “The world has witnessed how Islam, democracy and modernity can grow and develop together, supporting and strengthening one another in our country,” the President said before hundreds of participants at the congress. “We have to believe that Islamic teachings about sociopolitical principles support the creation of prosperous, democratic and just communities,” he added. Yudhoyono said that as the world’s most populous Muslim nation, Indonesia had a “historical mission” to bring back the glory of Islam. He reminded them, however, the glory had to be aimed at creating a harmonious and peaceful world order. “We must be grateful that in recent years our nation has been actively involved in bridging the gap between Islam and Eastern and Western civilizations. We need to continue this conciliatory effort. We do not recognize the clash of civilizations and shall not let that take place. “What we know and will continue to build is harmony among civilizations. We need to be at the forefront of developing a noble civilization as shown by Prophet Muhammad,” the President said. The 5th Indonesian Muslim Congress that will run until Sunday is drawing hundreds of participants representing dozens of Muslim organizations in the country. Sahal Mahfudh, chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama and the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), which organized the event, said in his opening speech the congress was expected to produce solutions for Muslim organizations on how to cope with new challenges in the era of globalization. “Free trade agreements have forced developing countries to open their doors to the influx of goods from other countries. This condition is encouraging more open competition among nations, including Indonesia,” Sahal said. “We must respond positively to the condition by empowering the mullahs in a more well-planned and measured way,” he added. Nevertheless, the three-day congress has triggered protest from Islamic militant group the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), who distributed leaflets stating their disappointment with the event’s steering committee to the participants of the opening day. The FPI is apparently angered with the committee’s  previous statements that it would not invite the group to the event, dubbing the FPI as a “controversial organization” that would “disrupt the greater interest”. The invitation arrived at the last minute, but the FPI claimed it was too short notice. “We thus assume the 5th Indonesian Muslim Congress would only be used as an event to show off the power of certain groups and political interests,” the FPI said in a statement. The committee initially did not invite the FPI, Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) and Majelis Mujahidin Indonesia (MMI). The committee finally invited the HTI but not the MMI. Hizbut Tahrir is an international Islamic movement that aims to establish a transnational caliphate, believing that democracy is contrary to the principles of Islam. The group’s representative at the meeting, Muhammad Rahmat Kurnia, criticized the President for not mentioning the application of sharia-inspired laws in his discussion about Islam. “Do not say [nice things about Islam] and then apply secularism,” he was quoted as saying on the group’s website.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/08/honor-democracy-sby-tells-muslims.html,,2010
"Sat, May 8 2010",Miyabi film debuts without incident,"The screening of the controversial, locally made film Menculik Miyabi (Kidnapping Miyabi) grabbed public attention across the city on Friday with threats from a hard-line Muslim organization to raid film theaters playing it. Many viewers flocked to theaters out of curiosity, wanting to see the Japanese adult star Maria “Miyabi” Ozawa, who was denied entry to the country by the Culture and Tourism Ministry last year due to the constant protests from the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). “I want to see Miyabi,” filmgoer Ocha told The Jakarta Post, adding that people should stop making a fuss about the film, as it passed the state censor body and was rated for teens. Ina, another viewer, concurred, saying that people should not judge Miyabi just because she starred in adult films. Ina also added that she was not afraid of watching it despite the threats by FPI members. Both Ina and Ocha said they enjoyed the comedic side of Menculik Miyabi but were disappointed because Miyabi herself had limited screen time. Menculik Miyabi was screened at 18 film theaters across the city on Friday. A manager of the Pondok Indah Mall branch of a theater chain said he was not planning to step up security despite widespread rumors of an imminent FPI sweep. The FPI is notorious for their violent and highly illegal and mostly unpunished raids. Most recently, they stormed a transgender workshop in Depok, South Jakarta. FPI economy unit head Mustafa Embong said the organization gave a mandate to the Jakarta branch of the FPI on Thursday to handle the issue. “We will act if the film causes societal unrest. “Our stance on this matter is clear. We will always perceive Miyabi as a forbidden character because she is a porn star, despite new non-pornographic roles.” Mukhlis Paeni of the Film Censorship Board told the Post that Menculik Miyabi did not violate the country’s procedural censorship standards. “There are no scenes in the film we consider pornographic. Nothing’s wrong with it,” he said, adding that the board did not object to passing the film, especially given the recent decline of the Indonesian film industry. The film’s producer, Ody Mulya, said he did not want his film being politicized, but just wanted the audience to watch it for entertainment purposes only. “I am afraid there are other parties wanting to take advantage of this issue and creating conditions for unhealthy competition in the film industry,” he said. He said he was also aware that the pros and cons surrounding his film could also propel its popularity. The 90-minute long Menculik Miyabi premiered on Thursday night.

Hendra Gunawan promised to investigate the case of a journalist, who on Wednesday was showered in glass bottles while covering a raid in Petamburan, Central Jakarta. ""We have gathered information from three victims and three witnesses, but we have not identified any suspects yet,"" he told The Jakarta Post on Thursday. Hendra refused to state that the perpetrators were members of the hard-line Islamic Defenders Front (FPI). Journalist from local daily Lampu Hijau, Octobryan Purwo, 25, was attacked by a group of men wearing turbans last Wednesday, when photographing them raiding a stall selling beverages. The police brought him to the nearby hospital, where he got seven stitches on his head. Margiyono from the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) urged the police to act swiftly. He cited the 1999 Press Law, which carries as a maximum one year of imprisonment and a fine of Rp 1 billion (US$104,000) for deterring journalists from covering news. In May alone, AJI received four reports on journalists being attacked in the country. Meanwhile, FPI chairman Salim bin Umar Alatas, said he planned to call the FPI troop commander Matsuni to ask whether their members were involved in the assault. He suspected the raid was undertaken by Muslim youths wearing FPI garb, because the organization had not scheduled any raid that day. ""If it turns out the perpetrators are our members, on behalf of the organization I apologize. ""The police can catch the suspects,"" he told the Post. Late in April, FPI added to its violent track record by storming a human rights workshop jointly organized by the National Commission for Human Rights and the Indonesian Transgender Communication Forum, at a hotel in Depok, West Java.

"Sat, June 19 2010",Fails to keep witnesses safe: Agency,"Witnesses and whistle-blowers are not sufficiently protected by the law, which is open to abuse and does not stipulate the need for risk analyses, experts say. Abdul Haris Semendawai of the Witness and Victim Protection Agency said, ""we need to make a more detailed law, especially regarding whistle-blowers"". ""The protection law stipulates the utilization of technology to shield witnesses, for example by conducting testimonies via video conference during a trial,"" Abdul said after an international seminar on witness and victim protection in Jakarta. ""However, the judges and prosecutors do not really understand this,"" he added. Abdul also said the Indonesian protection law needed more provisions that would ensure greater protection for witnesses, including whistle-blowers, such as risk assessment for witnesses. ""We do not have an academic risk analysis to assess the level of danger a witness can face,"" he said. ""The implementation of risk analysis can start within the internal bodies of an agency,"" he added. There have been some cases in which witnesses were not well protected, and subsequently suffered abuse, including physical harm. There have been several recent cases in which witnesses have faced risks of harm, in particular the case of religious rights activists Mohamad Guntur Romli and Nong Darol Mahmada and that of former National Police chief detective Comr. Gen. Susno Duadji, who revealed corruption in the police force. In September 2008, Guntur and Nong testified in court against the Islam Defenders' Front (FPI), whose members were on trial for charges of violently disrupting a peaceful demonstration by the National Alliance for Freedom of Faith and Religion in support of followers of Ahmadiyah in June of 2008. Some 70 religious activists were injured before the police broke up the confrontation and made arrests. During the trial session at the Central Jakarta District Court, Guntur and Nong were harassed and assaulted by members of the FPI immediately after they testified, highlighting weaknesses in the current witness protection law. The Witness and Victims Protection Agency cited injuries suffered by Comr. Gen. Susno Duadji in police custody as evidence for the pressing need to revise the 2006 Law on Witness Protection. Susno was arrested and remains in police custody on charges of accepting bribes shortly after he blew the whistle on case brokers, police officers and prosecutors for their alleged roles in the release of tax official Gayus Tambunan from charges of soliciting bribes from a taxpayer. According to the Witness and Victims Protection Agency, the current witness protection law cannot accommodate cases involving whistle-blowers who are witnesses as well as suspects. ""One of the reasons the protection law needs to be revised is because of the problems arising in the current whistle-blower case,"" he said. He added that the law should include an exact definition of the criteria for determining when someone could be classified as a whistle-blower. It is not only witnesses and whistle-blowers who are at risk of abuse. Lawyers, in particular, have been attacked, and at least one judge has been assassinated. Recently, two members of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation, Uli Parulian and Nurcholis Hidayat, were assaulted at a court house canteen during a break during a hearing on the Blasphemy Law earlier this year.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/06/19/fails-keep-witnesses-safe-agency.html,,2010
"Sat, June 26 2010",MP to report hard-line groups to rights body,"A PDI-P legislator said Friday she would report two Islamic groups and an NGO to the National Commission for Human Rights (Komnas HAM)for disrupting a House-sponsored free healthcare service the groups believed was a gathering of communists. On Thursday, the Banyuwangi branch of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), an Islamic-based religious forum and NGO Gerak disrupted a gathering they believed to be a meeting of the banned Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). ""I will report the incident as a violation of human rights to Komnas HAM on Monday, June 28,"" House of Representatives Commission IX head Ribka Tjiptaning, who attended the gathering, said at her party's headquarters. The party crashers, led by local FPI chairman Aman Faturahman, accused attendees of being communists, and demanded that everyone leave. ""There are members of the PKI community here. Why are they here?"" Aman shouted at the meeting's participants, as reported by Antara news agency. Ribka, Rieke Diah Pitaloka and Nursuhud of the House Commission IX overseeing health affairs were attending the event. Aman claimed the free healthcare service was only a pretext and that the gathering was actually a reunion of former communist party members and their descendants. ""What FPI Banyuwangi, FKUB and Gerak have done is antidemocratic and violates human rights,"" Ribka said. Ribka urged the public to sternly condemn such discriminatory - and illegal - actions. She charged that the disbandment of the meeting was tantamount to disenfranchising a section of society by discriminating against victims of the 1965 massacre of alleged communists. Ribka refuted the FPI's allegations that the meeting was a reunion of former communist party members and their offspring. ""The locals needed the healthcare services we were providing,"" she said, explaining that she and the other Commission IX members had given local people information about the public's right to obtain free healthcare. Ribka is the author of I Am Proud to Be a PKI Child, published in 2002. In the book, she claims to be inured to acts of intimidation. Ribka also said the complicity of law enforcement officers who supported the breaking up of Thursday's event was proof that President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono had failed to reform the National Police. During the incident, the police helped disband the gathering. House Speaker Marzuki Alie criticized the incident, saying the FPI should have spoken to the participants of the meeting before taking action. Criticism has also come from the former leader of Nadhlatul Ulama's National Board (PBNU), Hasyim Muzadi, who said the vigilante actions of the crowd led by the FPI was unacceptable.

"Tue, June 29 2010",LGBT rights: A test for Indonesian democracy,"In its third decade, the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) advocacy movement has progressed far from the days of the 1980s when gay men, transgender and lesbian women networked exclusively through the first and – at that time – the only gay magazine GAYa Nusantara. Solidarity rules: Three transvestites, also members of the Transgender Solidarity Network, commemorate the International Transgender Day, on Nov. 20, 2009.JP/Arief Suhardiman The movement is now, according to LGBT rights expert Baden Offord, facing one of the most critical periods in its development as it attempts to be more visible in the public sphere and seeks to engage more broadly with mainstream Indonesian society. More LGBT rights groups have emerged and have been fighting for the right of sexual orientation to be acknowledged as part of Indonesia’s universal human rights. In modern urban areas, gay men and lesbian women are becoming more visible in the workplace and within friendship circles. Increasing numbers of families are becoming more accepting of their gay sons and daughters’ sexual orientation. Popular culture has also become an avenue in which the existence of homosexuality is being recognized, with breakthrough films such as Arisan (Savings Gathering) depicting scenes of gay love. A festival of films with homosexual themes, Q Film Festival, has successfully been held in the last nine years, drawing larger crowds each year. Offord, an associate professor at the Southern Cross University and author of Homosexual Rights as Human Rights: Activism in Indonesia, Singapore, and Australia, said the Indonesian LGBT rights movement was beginning to take their discussions to regional and international levels, not just keeping them in localities. But as the LGBT movement seeks more space in the public sphere, hard-line minority religious groups are showing resistance through violence and intimidation, while the state apparatus does nothing to protect the movement’s right to freedom of expression. Back in March, the police stood by and, according to the eyewitness-account of lesbian activist Rr. Sri Agustine, were even sharing rice boxes with a mob of hard-liners from the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) who had forced their way into a Surabaya hotel, demanding participants of a planned congress on sexual orientation in the East Java city to leave the country. The hardliners told the conference organizers not to make a media statement, then vandalized GAYa Nusantara’s office, writing “ILGA = Terorist Moral” (ILGA = Moral Terrorists). Organizers of the International Gay and Lesbian Association (ILGA) Asia Conference eventually canceled the event, citing “security reasons”, after the police refused to grant them a permit, fearing protests from religious groups. Politicians and civil society organizations have quickly condemned the thuggery and police negligence as unconstitutional and violating human rights. Tom Boellstorff, author of The Gay Archipelago and professor at the department of Anthropology, University of California, said that the critical issue was the failure of the police to protect the people at the conference. “Will they be reprimanded? Why did the police issue a permit but then take it away for no reason? Will new protocols be put in place? Will those responsible for the intimidation, particularly the FPI, be arrested or otherwise reprimanded? “If they can get away with these kinds of illegal activities, then that says something very negative and sad about the current state of democracy in Indonesia — not just for LGBT persons, but for everyone,” he said in an email interview. The police responded saying that they had not issued a permit for the event, but were obliged to be present because they acknowledged that the “fierce” objections from dozens of mass organizations may have violated the security of East Java. Offord said: “The problem faced by the LGBT movement is summed up in one phrase — ‘explicitness’. LGBT rights are now a central litmus test for Indonesian democratic society.” Indonesia’s LGBT rights champion Dede Oetomo who founded GAYa Nusantara said that LGBT activists “believed that Indonesia — with all its problems — was a democratic country, in which such conferences could be held”. He said that Surabaya, the home base of GAYa Nusantara, was chosen because there had never been any previous violent incidents like those of March, 26, when the FPI stormed the hotel. Dede, who is also a lecturer at the social and political science department of Airlangga University in Surabaya, said that Indonesian activists also wanted to show a homegrown LGBT movement to the international world. LGBT organization Arus Pelangi founder Ridho Triawan said that if local LGBT activists managed to host the fourth ILGA-Asia conference it would give bigger political power for the movement. Offord said that in the short term the LGBT movement would be chastened by the conference cancellation. “It has tested the democratic pulse of the Indonesian nation and found that the pulse is weak,” he said. In the long term, however, he thought that it will actually strengthen the LGBT movement to become a more cohesive and deliberative movement. “There will be a lot of reflection on how to negotiate the present political and social climate,” he said. By contrast, Dede thinks that GAYa Nusantara is actually becoming more cautious and low-key, because of this recent intimidation. The head of the Women Rainbow Institute (IIP) Kamilia Manaf refused to be interviewed for precisely this reason. “Activists will understand the need to ally themselves with other progressive civil society groups. They will need to understand and practice human rights, and have political awareness.”  He said that the new generation of LGBT movement activists were passionate, educated and braver, however, which he finds solace in. Boellstorff said that the LGBT movement in Indonesia is flourishing but was facing many challenges, most of which have to do with the acceptance of LGBT persons in Indonesian society. “If Indonesia is truly to live up to its motto of ‘unity in diversity’, then there needs to be a national conversation regarding who is going to be included in that diversity. “Since LGBT Indonesians exist in great numbers and have always been a part of the archipelago, they are part of that diversity.”",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/06/29/lgbt-rights-a-test-indonesian-democracy.html,,2010
"Tue, June 29 2010","Disband FPI, say legislators and activists","Legislators and activists have called for the banning of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), a hard-line group known for its violent, vigilante actions against perceived threats to Islamic values. The Indonesian Parliamentary Pancasila Caucus, a group of legislators, regional representatives and activists, said President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono should prove “that the state cannot cower to acts of violence shown by the FPI” and other similar groups. All victims of the FPI’s thugs should report to the police so that the courts can classify the FPI as an outlaw group, the Caucus told a press conference on Monday. Their statement was triggered by FPI actions on Thursday against legislators in Banyuwangi, East Java. Legislator Ribka Tjiptaning of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) had reported the FPI to the police for breaking up a meeting  on the new health bill in a restaurant, which she was attending with two other legislators. Ribka also reported the incident to the National Commission for Human Rights (Komnas HAM), which, she said “should issue a recommendation to ban the FPI because of its frequent violation of human rights”. Banned groups, according to a 1985 law, include those who “disrupt security and public order” and which spread “communism or Marxism-Leninism or other teachings” in opposition to state ideology Pancasila and the Constitution. Ribka was attending the meeting with fellow members of the House of Representatives’ Commission IX overseeing health affairs, Rieke Diah Pitaloka and Nursuhud. Ribka also reported Banyuwangi Police chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Slamet Hadi Supraptoyo for negligence, saying police stood by as the FPI hooligans intimidated members into breaking up the meeting. Members of the Banyuwangi branch of the FPI, the Inter-religion Harmony Forum (FKUB) and NGO Gerak disrupted the gathering, which they believed to be a meeting of former members of the banned Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and their families. Ribka is the author of I Am Proud to Be a PKI Child, published in 2002. The secretary-general of the Jakarta branch of the FPI, Habib Novel, said the meeting “was actually a reunion of PKI members” or their sympathizers. “We couldn’t allow the meeting to take place because the PKI is a banned organization” since 1965, he said. FPI commander M. Sidiq said the group was “used to calls to disband.” Only its members or the Home Ministry could disband FPI, he said. In 2008, FPI leader Habib Muhammad Rizieq bin Husein Syihab was jailed for 18 months for inciting violence against members of the Alliance for the Freedom of Religion and Faith at a peaceful rally in Jakarta. Another Caucus member, Muslim scholar Ulil Abshar-Abdalla, and a new member of the executive board of the President’s Democratic Party, also cited the FPI’s “systematic violence over the past years”. “It’s important for us to continuously push the government to disband the FPI,” he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/06/29/disband-fpi-say-legislators-and-activists.html,,2010
"Wed, June 30 2010",Legislator: FPI has the military backing,"The police are reluctant to get tough with the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) group because of its ties to the Indonesian Military (TNI), a legislator says. “There is information saying the FPI is a pet of the TNI, and the police hesitate to deal face-to-face with the military, because police consider the armed forces their elder brother,” said Eva Kusuma Sundari, an Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) politician. She added the FPI was originally established to accommodate the interests of hard-line Muslim groups that had suffered from oppression by the government during the New Order era. “The organization is now part of the conflict management strategy the TNI exercises to maintain its power. The FPI serves as a stepping stone for the military to re-enter politics,” she said. It was a blatant accusation of the military’s role in supporting the FPI, which is known for anti-vice raids executed under the pretext of enforcing of Islamic law. Most recently, FPI members raided and dissolved a discussion on a health bill in the East Java town of Banyuwangi last Thursday between PDI-P members of the House of Representatives’ Commission IX on people’s welfare. Commission head Ribka Tjiptaning, also from the PDI-P, filed a report with National Police against the FPI on Monday and demanded the group’s dissolution and a probe of the Banyuwangi police chief’s decision to allow hard-liners to break up the event. Defense Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. I Wayan Midhio said Tuesday that the accusation was groundless and denied a link between the TNI and the FPI. “TNI does not have a pet. TNI is a group of professional soldiers who obey the law. Since the reform era, TNI has focused on professionalism,” he said. On Monday, a caucus consisting House legislators from various parties said that the government, TNI and Home Affairs Ministry were responsible for the birth of the FPI and demanded President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to exercise his authority and dissolve the group. Eva said government favoritism of the FPI was evident in a lack of follow-up actions against the group, despite its acts of violence. “In 2008, [Yudhoyono] looked as if he had enough of the FPI and called for a coordination meeting between several institutions, such as the TNI, police, and Home Affairs Ministry. However, the meeting failed to generate a significant outcome,” Eva said.   Yudhoyono’s decision came in response to an attack by members of FPI and other hard-line Muslim groups on freedom of religion supporters who rallied in defense of Ahmadiyah followers at the National Monument in Central Jakarta on June 1, 2008, she added. “After the meeting, the Home Ministry said the FPI could not be dissolved because it had never been listed with the ministry. However, I found out the FPI was indeed on the list. This means the ministry also has blood on their hands,” she added. Eva said the FPI was registered under Home Ministry Decree No. 69/ D111.3/VIII/2006. Home Ministry spokesman Saut Situmorang said that the FPI had been listed as a mass organization and that there were procedures that must be followed to dissolve an organization. “We need to secure the Supreme Court’s approval to disband a mass organization,” he told The Jakarta Post on Tuesday. National Police spokesman Insp. Gen.

"Wed, June 30 2010",Editorial: FPI no problem,"Most urban swells seem prone to it — gang violence, mob culture and a general abandonment of the law and order. Some excuse it as street justice, others couch it as a poverty related phenomenon. But the main difference ultimately is whether authorities, in this case the police and the city administration, actually do something about it. Cities such as Jakarta are not on the brink of anarchy. But it has descended into a chaotic temperament of might is right and an understanding that if no one does anything about it, bedlam is permissible irrespective of rights of others. Mobs have a long history in Indonesian politics. Most of the major socio-political organizations in this country have some form of “youth wing” in their ranks. How they choose to use them depends on the nature of the organization, circumstance and the level of political desperation on the day. These multipurpose garrisons are employed for a diverse range of activities, from social and political ones to being an intimidating deterrent. One thing is clear, they are meant to be a tour de force of political prowess. In some cases, “youth wings” can be an asset primarily because their parent organization is legitimate entities that engage in the formal socio-political sector. But when a mob culture seeps the masses, potentially productive elements become a threat. In a liberal political setting, without the patronage of a genuine organization, these groups become roving mobs that act like criminal gangs. In brief, the culture of thuggery. We applaud that the practice of thuggery, which has become so prominent in this metropolis, is finally being rightly vilified at the highest levels. A multi-party coalition of legislators at the House of Representatives has condemned the actions of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), demanding that the organization should be forbidden. A 1985 law raises the possibility of banning groups disruptive to security and public order, along with those which spread teachings in opposition to state ideology Pancasila and the Constitution. But banning the FPI, as a matter of fact, is unimportant. Perhaps even unnecessary, especially using laws that are rather draconian and originally designed to mitigate freedom of political association. To invoke the law now could actually open the flood gates of proscription for political motives toward legitimate groups who may be critics of the status quo. What’s in a name? Banning the FPI would only disperse membership into smaller, and even more radical gangs. The trouble with the FPI may not even be the FPI itself. It is the omission by the police to effectively encourage lawless activities through a “do nothing” attitude when such incidents arise. In fact, it seems almost a standard procedure to let incidents occur first, then take action once property and people’s heads have been bashed away. The police realize their duty to fight crime, but they certainly neglect a more important obligation to prevent crime. Some have even accused people close to police sources of actually being backers of groups of street thugs as part of a wider underworld racket that includes protection money and debt collection, among others. This habit of omission rewards anarchic behavior, empowering groups such as the FPI and a half dozen others in the capital with a sense of impunity. Actually, we cannot blame serial thugs for their behavior. There is no point expecting the higher rules of moral civility to groups of men (and some women) who are cowards and hypocrites by preying on pacifist civilians in the name of God. What we should condemn even more is the police and authorities who have not, and still are not, doing anything against these groups. Ultimately, they become the real brutes who decline communities and create public insecurity.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/06/30/editorial-fpi-no-problem.html,,2010

"Fri, July 2 2010",MUI repeatedly warned FPI on violence,"JAKARTA: The Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) repeatedly asked the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) not to use violence to achieve its goals — but to no avail, MUI chairman Amidhan said Thursday. MUI is an umbrella institution for Islamic mass organizations — from moderate to radical — but has no authority to disband groups deemed anarchist, he added. Amidhan made the comment after meeting with Vice President Boediono in Jakarta. The MUI head responded to reports of public anger after the FPI forcibly dispersed a meeting in Banyuwangi, East Java, attended by three legislators from Jakarta last week. FPI denied its involvement and said the raid was conducted by other local Islamic groups who thought the gathering was a meeting of former activists of the defunct Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). The incident revived calls to disband FPI, which has allegedly used violence to vandalize places and disrupt activities it deems un-Islamic. — JP",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/07/02/mui-repeatedly-warned-fpi-violence.html,,2010
"Sat, July 3 2010","FPI merely imagining PKI threat, says expert","A specter is haunting Indonesia -the specter of communism. Not likely, an observer and an official said, responding to the claim by the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). A political and military observer from the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, Hermawan Sulistyo, said Friday that those who claimed the disbanded Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) was planning a resurgence were ""creating an imaginary enemy"". ""What power does the PKI have now? It can no longer do anything - it's an old story from 40 years ago,"" Hermawan told the The Jakarta Post, referring to the group that is believed to have attempted a coup in 1965. Dozens of people donning the FPI symbol raided and broke up a meeting in a restaurant in Banyuwangi involving members of the House of Representatives committee overseeing health affairs. The FPI accused the legislators of holding a reunion for former members of the PKI. One of the lawmakers, Ribka Tjiptaning from Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, is the author of a memoir titled, I'm proud to be the daughter of a PKI member. FPI deputy secretary-general Awit Mashuri told TVOne that the hard-line group always ""coordinated"" with the state before it took action, dismissing allegations that it acted unlawfully. ""The information that 65 people were gathering came from the district military intelligent unit,"" Awit said. Referring to the FPI's claim that the Indonesian Military (TNI) encouraged them to act against the meeting, Hermawan said the TNI should focus on real threats. ""The PKI is an unreal threat. Why doesn't the TNI focus on real threats including domestic and foreign ones, such as terrorism and the Ambalat issue *a boundary dispute with Malaysia*?"" he said. Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. I Wayan Medhio, however, denied the FPI's statement that the TNI had been involved in the Banyuwangi raid. ""The military has no connection whatsoever with the FPI. It is not the duty of the military *to inform FPI members on activities relating to the PKI*. We will take action against our member who did this,"" Wayan told the Post. He said the government still considered communism a ""latent threat"" to the nation. ""What we should be more worried about, however, is the fact that the public is still easily agitated every time rumors spring up *about the return of communism*. ""The problem today actually lies in that there have been physical clashes between people who are accused of being supporters of the PKI and those who are against it,"" Wayan said. Hermawan said prominent communist countries like Russia and China had turned toward capitalism, adding that communism in Indonesia was a term pinned on atheists by majority Muslim communities. Secretary-general of the FPI's Jakarta branch, Habib Novel, said the raided meeting ""was actually a reunion of PKI members"" or their sympathizers. Ribka said the meeting had discussed a new health bill. Following the alleged intervention, Ribka reported the FPI to the police and the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM). ""Komnas HAM should issue a recommendation to ban the FPI because of its frequent violations against human rights"", Ribka said. National Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Marwoto Suto said it would follow-up on the report. Following the PKI coup on Sept. 30, 1965, widespread killings were conducted throughout the country, which may say target suspected communists. Reports vary on how many were killed - with most figures falling between 500,000 and 2 million.

"Sun, July 4 2010",The constrained and unconstrained views,"Raphael’s painting The School of Athens depicted Plato pointing to the sky and Aristotle pointing to the ground. It encapsulates the two approaches in how we perceive the world: perfection and grounded reality. These perspectives divide the world into unconstrained and constrained views, using terms used by Harvard professor of behavioral studies Tal Ben-Shahar. In psychology, they become perfectionism and optimalism; in politics, they become communism and capitalism; in everyday arguments, they become can-do and cannot-do. Plato’s unconstrained view distinguishes the world into the perfect model and the one we’re experiencing as mortals. He believed that an archetype always precedes the perceived world. An idea comes first, experience comes second. Aristotle, however, saw the world as one big reality, in which experience must precede perception and our senses don’t follow certain expectations. Experience comes first, synthesis of ideas comes second. Understanding how human nature works both at the individual and collective levels may shed some light on how to approach social and political issues, including current issues in Indonesia. Thomas Sowell in A Conflict of Visions, called “unconstrained” and “constrained” visions. He stated, “A vision is what we sense or feel before we have constructed any systematic reasoning that could be called a theory, much less deduced any specific consequences as hypotheses to be tested against evidence. A vision is our sense of how the world works.” This explains why certain systems based on an “unconstrained view” place people as powerful and unlimited beings, while other systems based on the “constrained view” claim that people are limited and bounded by nature and natural laws. Of course, there is a spectrum of visions or views, which also give place to hybrid systems. And most likely a system is not purely unconstrained or constrained either. Notions of utopia, such as communism and socialism, are based on the Platonian unconstrained view, in which people are believed to be able to do good deeds for others because they are unlimited beings with altruistic intentions. Capitalism, on the other hand, is based on an Aristotelian constrained view, in which people are limited to their own self-interest, a view which was popularized by Adam Smith. One thing, which unconstrained and constrained views are not, is the swing of the left and right spectrum or good and bad. The unconstrained view may sound leftist, but it’s actually referring to the control and uncontrollable elements of deeds. Thus, whether Indonesia is Platonian or Aristotelian isn’t important. What’s important is how to balance both unconstrained Utopian hopes and wishes with constrained actions and behavior. At the state level, this must be properly acknowledged by policy makers in their activities resulting in fair and just policies. At the public level, we should strive in understanding how things work and when and where a constrained vision is more appropriate than an unconstrained vision and vice versa. Pancasila itself is a set of noble principles with God as the ultimate model, just like how Plato believed in heavenly ideas. However, the performance of the Indonesian government is by far “a bad example” of Aristotelianism, as noticeable in the culture of corruption and massive human rights abuses. Such culture is an example of the worst type of self-interest. Extremist groups’ vision, such as the FPI (Islam Defenders Front), is unconstrained as they believe in the noble qualities of humans, which — unfortunately — are based on their version of virtues. Too much idealism tainted with violence, however, makes this noble intention a fakery worthy  punished by law. Altruistic motive doesn’t mean much when it’s not supported with factual altruistic deeds. And when violence is the chosen path, the notion of nobility is a fallacy. At this point, we may have been spending too much emphasis on the importance of noble intentions and virtues by adhering to some altruistic notions based on religious creeds and teachings. The recent Ariel-Luna sex video scandal also shows how the Indonesian government places excessive emphasis on its people’s private domain and morality. We need realistic fair and just policies, as much as we need realistic and doable acts, to help people, or at least to “do no harm”. John Stuart Mill said it well, “A person may cause evil to others not only by his actions but by his inaction, and in either case he is justly accountable to them for the injury.” Let’s  cultivate a calm and conscientious heart to find a balance between unconstrained and constrained views of the notions of how the world should be and what we should act upon.

"Mon, July 5 2010","Guest Speaker: We protect the FPI, police detective says","The National Police recently commemorated its 64th anniversary amid controversies and criticism from the public over many issues, including a lack of transparency and the force’s lack of action in dealing with the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Police chief detective Com. Gen. Ito Sumardi spoke to the press, including The Jakarta Post’s Bagus BT Saragih , shortly after attending the anniversary ceremony in Kelapa Dua, Depok, West Java, last Thursday. Question: The police have been criticized for failing to take action against FPI members, who often resort to violence. How do you respond to this? Answer: The police have limitations. We cannot monitor all social activities. Therefore, we need your help. Inform us if you want to hold any meeting. If you don’t, how can we give you any protection? Please, don’t say the police didn’t do anything (to protect the public). Society has become more dynamic now. The public has grown suspicious that the police are backing the extremists. Is this opinion correct? No. No. That’s completely incorrect. The FPI is a registered social organization. They are under our protection and supervision. We protect them. But that does not mean that we are allowing them to enforce the law like we do. The National Commission for Human Rights has indicated the police were negligent during the Banyuwangi incident in which FPI members allegedly disrupted a meeting between lawmakers and their constituents. How do you respond to this? It is their right to express their opinion. However, I suggest that all parties study first what really happened before forming any judgment. Has the force investigated several top officers who, according to Tempo, have implausibly large amounts of money in their bank accounts? There are 21 officers whose bank accounts are now being checked out. We’re still waiting for the results. How many officers are having their accounts checked out? Some of them. Who are they? I won’t tell you. Police chief Gen. Bambang Hendarso Danuri said in a ceremony speech that the police must promote transparency and be accountable. Why do the police seem to be very defensive in responding in this matter? You must understand that being transparent is good as long as it does not break the law. Bank accounts, according to the Banking Law, are confidential. After all, we must also respect the presumption of innocence. But is the police following up on Tempo’s report? I’ve told you, we’re checking out the accounts. That’s what we’re doing. While the public expect answers about the officers’ suspicious bank accounts, the police announced that they would sue Tempo. Why? This is about how to respect one another. This can be a lesson for both the police and the media. If you want to criticize, go ahead, but respect the law. The police are now investigating a case that implicates police officers. Can the police be impartial and avoid conflict of interest? We are professionals.

"Tue, July 6 2010",Issues: `No need to ban FPI',"The Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) says that there is no need to ban the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) despite the latter's continuous violent methods in preaching supposedly peaceful Islamic teachings. ""Let the law handle the *FPI*. As long as the police are firm on them, there is no need for them to become an illegal organization,"" PKS senior politician Agus Purnomo told reporters over the phone Tuesday. Agus said that FPI's brutality often came as a result of the police's ignorance. Agus also denied that FPI members were a vital part of his party's constituents. ""The majority of our voters are not from the FPI,"" he said. Previously, a caucus of legislators coming from various parties at the House of Representatives officially launched a statement demanding the FPI be banned. The PKS, which recently announced it would be more pluralist, had none of its legislators signing the statement. So is the case with the United Development Party (PPP), another Islamic party, and the relatively inclusive National Mandate Party (PAN). The only Islamic party to have signed the statement was the National Awakening Party (PKB), which was founded by the country's most prominent pluralist figure, the late Abdurrahman ""Gus Dur"" Wahid. The latest violent conduct made by the FPI was the ousting of three legislators during a free health clinic event. The FPI suspected the event was a reunion of the now disbanded Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) members. Your comments: The prophet even protects Jews, Christian, and other non-Muslims, as long as they submit to the Islamic rules, but if they break the Islamic rules or violate God's law, are immoral or sin, action will be taken against them. I'm not an FPI member, I'm just an ordinary Muslim and I learn Islam. The existence of the FPI is needed. So they must not be banned because their existence is aimed at improving the morality of the nation based on Islamic teaching. Ridwan Bandung Dear policeman, the PKS and the FPI are calling you guys ignorant and stupid for not enforcing the law on the FPI. Can you please put every single one of those violent criminals into jail so the rest of Indonesia can live in harmony? You would be doing this nation a huge favor so this nation can grow and prosper in peace. Richard Jakarta Ridwan, your logic baffles me. It's clear that the FPI does not and will not improve the nation's Islamic teachings by condoning violence. There's no need to submit to a particular religious teaching or rule. Last time I checked, Indonesia was a free country. Yes, sure, the majority of people practice Islam but that doesn't mean the rest of us have to follow it. It is a free country after all. I have respect for people who practice and preach other religions. I will not mock their religions and put my religion on top of others. They are all equal! Religions are being used as tool of propaganda here. Wake up and live in the present. Just like any other bad fruits in the basket, we need to get rid of them! H.T.

"Thu, July 15 2010",No raids ahead of Ramadan: Police chief,"In a visit to the police headquarters Wednesday, nonviolence activist groups urged National Police chief Gen. Bambang Hendarso Danuri to take stern action against hard-line groups known to have committed acts of violence. Usman Hamid, chief of the Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence (Kontras), said after the meeting the police chief had promised the activists to punish municipality police chiefs who ignored violent acts in their districts. “The chief also guaranteed that ahead of Ramadan, there will be no raids on cafes in the name of religion,” he said, as quoted by Antara news agency. “The chief agreed that violence had to be eradicated in the country.” “We are extremely worried about these constant violent acts committed by groups of vigilantes or hard-liners who keep taking over the role or function of the police in this country,” he said. He said the groups always claimed they were acting on behalf of Islam or under the banner of anti-communism. “The violence has been recurring in certain areas in Indonesia, and it has been inflicted on certain religious minorities, as well as on those who are accused of being communist,” he said. Usman said the vigilante groups also attacked sexual minorities, the urban poor, and human rights activists such as those from the National Commission for Human Rights and lawmakers. “This phenomenon is very perturbing, especially as our nation is in the middle of democratization,” said Usman, who was speaking on behalf of the groups, which included Wahid Institute, Imparsial, Setara Institute, the Indonesia Corruption Watch (ICW) and a caretaker of an Islamic boarding school in Cirebon, West Java, Maman Imanulhaq. Despite the nation’s plurality, “the unstoppable violence over the past few years has completely threatened the spirit of nationalism among us.” The police, Usman  said,  were “dumbfounded” and failed to uphold justice and take firm action against hardliners. He said it was not surprising that the public suspected the National Police were supporting the perpetrating organizations. Experts have expressed concern over the police’s inability to uphold justice in the face of violent offenders. Recently, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) threatened to wage “war against Christianization”. The group also broke up a political meeting in Banyuwangi, East Java. One of the attending legislators, Ribka Tjiptaning, claimed the police had supported the FPI’s move and asked them  end the meeting. Earlier the FPI attacked a meeting of transgender activists in West Java and an Ahmadiyah mosque in South Jakarta. No perpetrators were arrested as a result of the incidents. On the heel of the police’s anger at Tempo magazine’s recent cover illustration depicting a police officer walking with piggybanks, Molotov cocktails were thrown by unknown assailants at the magazine’s office.

"Fri, July 16 2010",FPI elites gearing up to replace Habib Rizieq,"The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) will not hold its congress for new leadership until 2013, yet several of its elites are already in competition to wrest the chairmanship from the frail Habib Rizieq. A source within the FPI said internal rivalry has intensified since 2005 between the founding elite and those who have since joined the organization. Rizieq previously showed preference for fellow Arab-descendant Habib Faiz Alatas, a graduate of Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt, to take over the hard-line group's leadership. Faiz, then FPI secretary-general, was among the key provocateurs of the raids on the Liberal Islamic Network (JIL) headquarters in Utan Kayu, East Jakarta, in August, 2005. His preaching at the Al-Azhar Mosque in South Jakarta ignited a wave of anger among FPI members and followers against the JIL movement led by liberal Islamic figure Ulil Abshar-Abdalla. Rizieq's concealed support for Faiz eventually stirred up debate within the FPI elite, particularly the founding figures who considered Faiz to have no root in the organization and no strong network. Just two years before the 2009 congress to elect a new FPI leader, Faiz died in an accident. ""Habib Faiz died in a traffic accident around three years ago,"" said FPI secretary-general Ahmad Sobri Lubis. Sobri said Faiz was remembered by fellow FPI members as a young, inspiring and enthusiastic cleric, who often replaced Rizieq when he could not deliver the Thursday night sermon. ""Faiz was not the crown prince of the FPI. There's no such thing as that. Everyone has an equal chance to lead,"" said Sobri. As for leadership regeneration, Sobri said it would only be done in the upcoming congress in 2013. ""Several years ago, Habib Rizieq had called us to prepare younger figures to replace him because he was too exhausted to lead. However, so far, no one been deemed suitable to replace him,"" said Sobri. Sobri was optimistic the upcoming congress was likely to see new leadership. FPI secretary for the Consultative Assembly Syeikh Misbahul Anam said he was preparing the next generation of leaders to replace Rizieq. ""We have some potential members who deserve to lead, and we are continuously developing them for the next congress. Anyone can be named leader,"" said Misbahul, whose boarding school Al-Umm was FPI's first headquarters. ""We do not recognize seniority. Everyone has the same obligations, rights and chances."" Sources at FPI said among candidates to replace Rizieq included Sobri Lubis, Misbahul and Munarman, the commander of the FPI's militia, the Islam Defender Troops (LPI). Sobri and Misbahul are among the founding figures of FPI while Munarman is a new figure, who joined the organization less than four years ago. Munarman, who spent 18 months in prison with Rizieq for inciting the Monas incident in 2008, is a former chairman of the high-profile Indonesia Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI). Munarman also deals with FPI legal affairs. Rendi Witular/Hans David",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/07/16/fpi-elites-gearing-replace-habib-rizieq.html,,2010
"Fri, July 16 2010",Al-Umm boarding school: FPI's forgotten cradle of history,"""You are in Islamic territory. Please mind your manners by speaking politely and not showing your aurat *parts of the body that should be covered in Islam*,"" reads a welcome sign at the entrance to Al-Umm Islamic boarding school. Tucked in a small alley called Gang Jamblang on Jl. WR Supratman in South Tangerang regency, the school is hardly recognizable as a typical Islamic establishment from its exterior. A small plastic name plaque is the only clue to the building's function. The fairly modest establishment played witness to the birth of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), a hard-line organization notorious for its violent attacks on those it deems offensive to Islamic values and virtues. Inside the compound another sign reads, ""Do not tire or become exhausted in the struggle to eradicate Ahmadiyah"". Ahmadiyah is a religious sect considered blasphemous to Islam because it does not recognize Muhammad as the last prophet. Despite the signs, a student, Ilham, greeted visitors in a friendly manner, taking them to meet the school's founder and owner Syeikh Misbahul Anam. There was no hint of menace on the features of the 40-something year old sheikh, who smiled in a friendly manner - a far cry from the terrifying expressions worn by FPI field commanders in action Misbahul, from Brebes, Central Java, said his school was established about a year before the FPI was officially founded at the school on Aug. 17, 1998. He said that during the first year, the school had occupied a 70 square-meter plot of land, and had only nine students. Now the school has around 51 students. ""*FPI chairman* Habib Rizieq was also one of the facilitators and the conceptualists of the ideas that led to the establishment of this school,"" said Misbahul, now the secretary of the FPI's consultative assembly. Misbahul said the FPI had been born when he befriended current FPI leader Habib Rizieq long before the establishment of Al-Umm. Together they decided to set up the FPI at the boarding school, which was the group's first headquarters before it was relocated to Rizieq's residence in Petamburan, Central Jakarta. ""We share the same ideas on cruelty, infidelity and injustice toward Muslims,"" said Misbahul, who was FPI secretary-general - second in command after Rizieq - during the early years of the FPI. However, Misbahul said, he and Al-Umm had slowly moved out of the limelight as the leaders and instigators of the FPI. In spite of this, Misbahul said, he remained an active member of the FPI, and that one of his tasks was to prepare the next generation of FPI leaders to replace Rizieq when he was too tired to continue. ""We have some potential members who deserve to lead, and we are continuously developing them for the next congress *in 2013*. Anyone can be named leader,"" he said. ""We do not recognize seniority. Everyone has the same obligations, rights and chances."" It is thought that the FPI branched off from the Pamswakarsa civil guard, a security force formed by the military to support the Habibie regime. Then Indonesia Military (TNI) commander Gen. Wiranto and then Jakarta police chief Noegroho Dja-yusman are thought to have masterminded the formation of the FPI. Both have repeatedly denied the allegation despite that the FPI openly declared support for Wiranto during his presidency bid in 2004 and vice-presidency bid in 2009. Misbahul also denounced an allegation that the military and the police were backing the FPI. He said the military would not approach the FPI until the group gained popularity and influence. ""For example, then TNI territorial chief Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono *now the President* once asked for our assistance in dealing with insurgencies in Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam,"" Misbahul said. ""So, it was not us who came to the military generals, it was they who came to us."" Presidential spokesman Julian Aldrin Pasha said he was not aware of the cooperation between Yudhoyono and FPI leaders. Misbahul also said the generals had come to the FPI to seek assistance in dealing with security issues. ""As long as their requests are made for security reasons, then we will help them. We will not help any request concerning infidelity,"" he said.

"Fri, July 16 2010",Islam Defenders mutating into splinter cells for hire,"Indications are rife that the vigilante group the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) is degenerating into an unchained organization, allowing various vested interests to use the group's revolting elites to instill the threat of violence in regions where they see fit. The Jakarta Post' s Rendi Akhmad Witular and Hans David Tampubolon explored how the FPI is mutating into a new kind of threat. Upon entering Jl. Petamburan 3, the main road heading to the FPI headquarters-cum residence of FPI chairman Habib Rizieq, in Central Jakarta, a string of cautious eyes greet unknown visitors. A couple of men guarding and working on the renovation of Rizieq's modest residence question the purpose of any visit to the site. ""Habib is currently sick and cannot meet anyone for the time being. He is very tired,"" said Amat, one of the guards. After being released from prison in July last year, Rizieq's health has been deteriorating. Rizieq was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment for instigating the FPI's bloody attack on members of the Alliance for the Freedom of Religion and Faith in the National Monument park, Central Jakarta, on June 1, 2008. The firebrand cleric, who earned his degree in Saudi Arabia, now spends most of his time resting in bed or preaching at the FPI's mosque every Thursday night. While Rizieq stays low, other FPI elites, mostly from regional chapters, have been busy becoming political mercenaries without consent from FPI's headquarters. The elites have used the FPI franchise to form splinter groups to support political parties and regional leaders. In his statement on Monday, Rizieq said the recent raid of a meeting attended by legislators from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) in Banyuwangi, East Java, in late June was not authorized by headquarters. ""The FPI Banyuwangi chapter has been frozen since late April due to an internal dispute. Thus, any activities representing the FPI are forbidden. But somehow they happen,"" he said. FPI leaders in Banyuwangi have been marred by conflagrations for supporting certain political parties. Aside from the Banyuwangi raids, Rizieq also highlighted several illegitimate raids in Bekasi and Depok in West Java, and Singkawang in West Kalimantan. He claimed the Bekasi raid, in which the Tiga Mojang (Three Ladies) statue was torn down because it was deemed to represent the Christian Trinity, was actually conducted by proxies of the Bekasi mayor. Several FPI members, who requested anonymity for safety reasons, said that while Rizieq remained the group's patron, he no longer had a firm grip on consolidating the personal interests of the FPI elites, who were now competing with each other to replace him at the 2013 congress. Retired intelligence officer Soeripto said he believed Rizieq had gradually lost control of the organization, which was very prone to being used by intelligence community and law enforcers to serve the interests of the ruling elite. ""It seems now the FPI has a different patron and backing,"" said Soeripto, who is among the patrons of the Islamic-based Prosperous Justice Party (PKS). ""The Banyuwangi incident has shown how Rizieq can no longer maintain a grip on his followers and how the FPI is prone to being infiltrated by the intelligence community either for national or foreign interests."" However, FPI secretary-general Ahmad Sobri Lubis denied the suggestion that Rizieq was unfit to lead the organization. ""Habib is still in control of the situation. But the regional chapters have full autonomy to act."" Over the past three years, raids and street rallies carried out by the FPI have mostly been organized by its regional chapters, notably those in Banten, West Java and East Java. Analysts believe the FPI will eventually break apart into several autonomous splinter cells similar to those of the Pancasila Youth organization, which no longer holds allegiance to their original patron Japto Soerjosoemarno. The organization is now breaking up into smaller groups widely associated with thugs, operating independently from each other. ""If the FPI is mutating into smaller independent factions, it will be more difficult for the authorities to shut them down as there will be numerous leaders claiming to be operating under the FPI brand,"" said Soeripto. Chairman of the Indonesian Muslim Movement (GUII), Abdurrahman Assegaf, said the FPI would not mutate into smaller factions as long as Habib Rizieq remained in power. ""Habib is still functioning as a kind of moral figure that at some level still unites the FPI elites. He is so instrumental in keeping the group intact,"" said Abdurrahman, who has joined forces with the FPI in clamping down on Ahmadiyah - a religious sect considered blasphemous to Islam because it does not recognize Muhammad as the last prophet. Abdurrahman said the FPI was unlikely to be dissolved as long as law enforcers were not cooperative in complying with demands from the Muslim community to eradicate activities deemed to threaten Islamic teachings. ""There's always demand for a vigilante group like the FPI because of the law enforcement vacuum, coupled with abundant uneducated Muslims who are prone to be lured into committing violence."" The FPI is a splinter group of the Pamswakarsa civil guard formed by the military to support the Habibie regime. The group has been marred by acts of violence allegedly ordered by political parties or businessmen. Unlike any other hard-line group, the FPI's struggle is aimed at crushing activities deemed unfit according to Islam, such as prostitution, gambling, drinking and atheism. The group's use of ultra violence, which has triumphed over the rule of law in secular Indonesia, is still less potent than that of Jamaah Al Islamiyah, the terrorist group involved in a string of bombings, or Laskar Jihad (Jihad Troops), which incited a sectarian conflict in Maluku. Sobri Lubis said it was not unusual for the FPI to receive orders from the police to raid establishment deemed to violate Islamic teachings. Police have repeatedly denied such allegations. National Police chief Gen. Bambang Hendarso Danuri told activists Wednesday that all violence ""had to be eradicated"" in the country. According to FPI Consultative Assembly secretary Misbahul Anam, then TNI territorial chief Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono *now the President* asked for the group's assistance in dealing with insurgencies in Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam. In July 1999, FPI leaders met high-ranking military generals, including Yudhoyono, at the TNI headquarters in Cilangkap, East Jakarta, to discuss solutions for the insurgencies in Aceh, according to media reports at the time. The administration of President Yudhoyono has thus far proven unable to crack down on the organization, which has regularly committed violence freely under the noses of law enforcers. Presidential spokesman Julian Aldrin Pasha said he was not aware of the cooperation between Yudhoyono and FPI leaders. He said the President had shown strong commitment to bring to justice any criminal groups without prejudice. He said the FPI may now become a tool in a turf war between governing elites with authority for policy-making. The turf war includes clandestine battles between the military and the police, between Islamic organizations and liberal wings, between pro-democracy and antidemocracy, and between political elites over the Bank Century bailout scandal. ""The FPI has been nurtured for almost 12 years as a tool for state terrorism. It can be used to discredit Islam, or to sideline the police or certain political parties, or even to divert public attention from certain high-profile scandals involving policy makers,"" he said. Since its birth in 1998, the FPI has been involved in at least 50 incidents. the FPI's most infamous incidents 1998 Nov. 22 : Ketapang incident in Central Jakarta. 1999 September : Raids on prostitution and gambling dens in Jakarta 2000 Dec. 14 : Raids on prostitution den in Subang for allegedly harboring thugs involved in the attack on the residence of an FPI senior member. 2001 Oct. 15 : Jakarta police deploy around 1,000 officers to storm FPI headquarters.

"Sat, July 17 2010",Law revision needed to ban violent groups,"Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi responded to mounting calls that the government dissolve violent mass organizations, by challenging legislators to revise existing laws. The 1985 Mass Organizations Law, he said, did not give the government the authority to disband hard-line groups committing acts of violence. “The law guarantees freedom of association and speech, even if the groups launch violent raids. If the public demands regulation to change the current situation, the House of Representatives must revise the law,” Gamawan told The Jakarta Post on Friday, commenting on increasing public unrest over the violent conduct of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Media outlets have reported the acts of violence committed by the group in their raids on gambling dens, brothels and non-Muslim events in the past few years. In the latest incident last month, people clad in FPI gear forcibly broke up a meeting attended by legislators Rieke Diah Pitaloka and Ribka Tjiptaning of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) in Banyuwangi, East Java. Gamawan said his role as home minister would allow him to issue three warnings before submitting a recommendation to the Supreme Court to disband the group, as stipulated by law. “We have so far issued the first warning to the organization when it forcibly disbanded a protest organized by pluralist activists and students at the National Monument in 2008,” he said. “But afterwards, there were no more incidents so that we didn’t issue a second or third warning.” PDI-P legislator Gandjar Pranowo, who is also deputy chairman of the House Commission II on home affairs, said the PDI-P and several parties had proposed a review of the law years ago but that the House had turned it down. “The key to solving the issue of [violent groups] is not a review of the law, but the government’s capacity to educate mass organizations. They would not resort to violence should the Home Ministry do its job properly.” Gandjar called on courts to appropriately handle a lawsuit filed by his colleagues as an effective way to disband the organization, instead of the protracted process needed to revise the law. “If FPI members were found guilty of committing violence, the court should include disbanding the organization in its verdict,” he said. Meanwhile, speaking on a moratorium on the formation of new regions, Gamawan said the process had to be suspended until the government completed its grand design of the ideal number of provinces, regencies and municipalities. “I will immediately introduce the grand design to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono before it is unveiled to the public,” he said. Indonesia currently has 33 provinces and 499 regencies and municipalities. Gamawan reiterated the President’s recent statement that 80 percent of newly developed regions failed to implement regional autonomy.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/07/17/law-revision-needed-ban-violent-groups.html,,2010

"Wed, July 21 2010",Police warn against Ramadan raids,"The Jakarta Police vowed to protect entertainment centers from violent raids from hard-line organizations during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which starts next month. “We don’t want any organizations to take the law into their own hands for any reason whatsoever because it’s a crime,” Jakarta Police director of security and intelligence Sr. Comr. Irlan said Tuesday, adding that such raids would not solve any problems. The police have come under fire for their complacency toward several acts of violence by hard-line organizations in the city. The police did not make any arrests during the forced stoppage of several church constructions in Bekasi earlier this year. The police also responded awkwardly to a recent attack by hard-line groups on a seminar attended by a group of transvestites at a hotel in Depok, West Java, where they also refused to arrest anyone. Jakarta Tourism Agency head Arie Budiman said after the enactment of the 2006 tourism bylaw that no raids were to be conducted by any organizations during the fasting month in the city. He said that the peaceful situation would be maintained because the agency, working with police and the Public Order Agency, would properly enforce the bylaw. Arie said he would ensure the administration would keep the religious aspect of the month in mind. He said his agency shut down eight entertainment spots in 2009, five in 2008, three in 2007 and five in 2006. The head of the Jakarta branch of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), Salim bin Umar Alatas, insisted on holding the organization’s annual agenda: monitoring alleged violations at entertainment venues. “If there is [an entertainment spot] open, breaching regulations, we will raid it,” he informed The Jakarta Post via telephone of his illegal plans. Salim said the almost 15,000- strong FPI member base in the city would monitor venues such as massage parlors, karaoke bars, nightclubs and cafes. He said the situation was relatively calm in the past four years, with many entertainment spots closing when the FPI intended to raid them. “They are afraid of the FPI, so they close,” he said. The 2006 tourism bylaw says nightclubs, discotheques, spa centers, massage parlors and bars should cease operations entirely. Karaoke bars, live music venues and pool halls located in the same area are subject to restricted operating hours from 8:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m.. Pool halls not located close to karaoke bars and live music venues can only operate from 10 a.m. to 12 a.m., but cannot operate if they are located close to entertainment venues that have to remain boarded up. The same regulation allows bars and clubs located in star-rated hotels to remain open. Indonesian Association of Entertainment Businesses secretary-general Adrian Maelite said there were 1,300 entertainment permits issued to 400 outlets in the city. “I hope during the restricted hours, the police do not conduct open raids that disturb customers,” he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/07/21/police-warn-against-ramadan-raids.html,,2010

Only police have the authority to take action against nightclubs,” Aqiel said during the NU anniversary celebrations in Kudus, Central Java on Saturday. Aqiel also called on other Muslim groups to dismiss any suggestions to raid entertainment centers prior to or during Ramadan, which he said would tarnish the purity of the fasting month. Your comments: I’m impressed by the NU, which seems to have its eyes open to the unjust and illegal activities carried out by certain Muslims. Hopefully these aren’t just empty words. The current National Police chief hasn’t done enough to prosecute hard-line Muslim groups for their past actions. The FPI is still encouraging arson as “the awesome work of Allah”. The Ramadan season in Indonesia is intimidating for non-Muslims given the increased likelihood of muggings and attacks. I guess fasting makes certain people more violent. Hopefully the police follow through on their commitment to constrain those that violate the law, including the FPI. David K. Jakarta Finally, an intelligent statement from the NU.

Who has given the FPI the right to violate the Koranic injunction (2:257),  “There is no compulsion in religion”. Was it not Prophet Muhammad who said during his farewell address: “Your lives and your possessions have been made immune by God to attacks by one another until the Day of Judgment”. Even as the fingers of two hands are equal, so are human beings equal to one another. No one has any right, any superiority to claim over another.

When I read the news this morning that the Islam Defenders Front  (FPI) attempted to forcefully close a mosque of the Ahmadiyah Muslim Community, I became very disturbed. The FPI has attacked the very definition of what it means to be an Indonesian citizen. The Indonesian government has to realize that the FPI is an extremist group that cannot accept diversity and tolerance of various faiths. Not very long ago, the same group threatened followers of Christianity simply because they were preaching to Muslims. If the Indonesian government does not take firm action to stop this I am afraid Indonesia will enter into a violent and chaotic situation similar to those facing countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan today.

The way to settle this kind of problem could be through dialogues between representatives of the regional government and Ahmadiyah members, as well as members of mainstream Muslim organizations, he said.  Slamet said settling the problem was easier said than done. On the one hand a joint ministerial decree on Ahmadiyah signed two years ago needs to be implemented. “But on the other hand, Ahmadiyah members insist to maintain their existence, exercise their activities and even try to expand their following,” he said.

"Fri, August 6 2010",Who nurtures Betawi gangs?,"The frequent brawls involving Betawi organizations in Jakarta have raised questions over why they still exist, and who encourages them. It is normal for ethnic-based groups to protect their territory, University of Indonesia sociologist Muhammad Mustofa said. ""They want to show their teeth on their turf. Violence is also a by-product of unemployment, when thuggery and crime become the only alternatives,"" Mustofa said. The Betawi Consultative Body (Bamus Betawi) was established to supervise the activities of Betawi-based mass organizations in Jakarta on June 22, 1982. It now has more than 110 affiliates. Two Bamus affiliates, the Betawi Brotherhood Forum (FBR) and the Betawi People's Communication Forum (Forkabi), were involved in recent brawls in South Jakarta. The Jakarta Police have refused to disband the organizations, saying their existence is protected under the Constitution. Furthermore, instead of taking action against the groups, Jakarta Governor Fauzi Bowo opted to embrace the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) group to ""maintain security and order"" in the city during the upcoming fasting month of Ramadan. The move has been criticized because the FPI has a well-documented history of committing violent acts against those it believes are not in line with their perspectives. Political scientist Chusnul Mariyah explained that in Indonesia's developing electoral democracy, politicians had the maneuverability to use various tools to further their political agendas. This sometimes involves using thugs, gang lords and the mafia. ""The problem in this reform era is that some of these thugs, gang members and mobsters are becoming politicians themselves. This also raises questions about how the Betawi consultative body works in relation to both thugs and civil authorities,"" Mariyah said. ""The city administration, among other benefactors, picks up our tab,"" Bamus Betawi vice chairman Amarullah Asbah said. However, these are non-binding funds that do not shape the body's policies. ""The city administration is only our partner,"" he said. Data obtained by The Jakarta Post shows that the city allocated Rp 700 million (US$78,400) from the city budget for Bamus Betawi in 2009. Bamus Betawi vice secretary general Azis Khafia explained that the body spent the funds on transparent activities and programs. ""We once donated Rp 50 million each to the FBR and the Forkabi to support their large gatherings. But we also fund the Betawi cultural society *LKB* programs,"" Aziz said. It's a mutual relationship between parties who need mass support for their political interests and organizations who want to maintain their power, he added. ""Fauzi is our asset,"" said Husain Sani, a member of the Bamus Betawi advisory board, who heads Forkabi. Fauzi is a native Betawi governor and currently heads the Bamus Betawi advisory board. Betawi community figure Ridwan Saidi explained that some Betawi mass organizations were struggling with their identity in Jakarta, and some feared they were being marginalized in their own town. ""They have identity problems. They fear becoming outcasts, so they assert their existence through violence,"" Ridwan said. According to Ridwan, each Betawi group ran activities to preserve their culture, however, it was difficult for them to formulate and coordinate their activities. ""It is hard for them to focus solely on cultural preservation. Beyond that they turn their focus onto economic activities. Eventually there are rivalries and economic power struggles,"" Ridwan said. He added that business rivalries often stemmed from conflicts over rights to collect from traditional markets and parking lots; conflicts that were usually resolved using force and violence.

"Sat, August 7 2010","FPI meets police, offers protection","In what critics are calling a blatant display of contempt for the city’s authorities, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader visited the Jakarta Police headquarters Friday to offer the group’s services in enforcing a city bylaw that bans some entertainment establishments from operating during Ramadan. “We will protect the police and public order officers by enforcing the bylaw. We are ready to face thugs who stand in the way of these law enforcers,” FPI leader Habib Rizieq told reporters after the meeting. Rizieq promised that his organization would not conduct any raids. “We will just tip off the police about entertainment places that remain open in spite of the ban.” He said he had made a commitment with the police and the city administration that the group would not engage in violence, and to punish any FPI member who violated the pact. Jakarta police spokesman Sr. Comr. Boy Rafli Amar declined to comment about the offer, but welcomed the FPI’s commitment to not engage in violence. Boy said that like normal law-abiding citizens, FPI members could only report violations of the law to the police. Despite the assurance, the public remain concerned that a notoriously violent group are attempting to involve themselves in the police duty of maintaining security. The FPI has a long, mostly unchallenged record of carrying out violence and sometimes deadly raids in Jakarta, including against entertainment establishments during Ramadan. They have also been involved in shows of force in closing down houses of worship belonging to minority groups. “This will bring chaos to the city as everyone now has the right to enforce the law according to their own understanding or belief,” Jakarta Residents Forum (Fakta) chairman Azas Tigor Nainggolan said. Azas said that such a partnership was evidence of the authority’s inability to protect the public. “It is  [the police’s] job not the groups’ to ensure the security of the people.” He said he was saddened by Jakarta Governor Fauzi Bowo’s recent move to agree to cooperate with the hardliners to enforce the law. Meanwhile, Legal Aid Foundation director Nurkholis Hidayat said the coalition “supports violence and harasses the public’s rights”. “These groups are known for their violent acts. Who can ensure they will not go out of control,” he said. He warned that the move could lead to legal uncertainty among the public as everybody would try to take the law into their own hands. Before the FPI, the Betawi Brotherhood Forum (FBR) visited the police headquarters Thursday and offered a similar service. The groups said they wanted to help the authorities enforce a 2004 city bylaw that says that nightclubs, discotheques, spas, massage parlors and bars should cease operations entirely in Ramadan. Other entertainment centers, like karaoke establishments and live music venues, are required to limit their operating hours. According to the Indonesian Association of Entertainment Businesses, 1,300 entertainment permits have been issued to 400 establishments in the city. The FPI has a long, mostly unpunished record of carrying out violence and sometimes deadly raids in Jakarta.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/07/fpi-meets-police-offers-protection.html,,2010
"Sun, August 8 2010","Fauzi, police chief hobnob with FPI","The relationship between city authorities and the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) appears friendly despite the hard-line group’s reputation for violence. Jakarta Governor Fauzi Bowo and Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Timur Pradopo attended the 12th anniversary celebration of the FPI at the organization’s headquarters in Petamburan, Central Jakarta, on Saturday, leading critics to say they both feared the FPI. Fauzi and Timur’s attendance comes a day after FPI leader Habib Rizieq visited Jakarta Police headquarters to “offer” the group’s “services” in enforcing a city bylaw banning some entertainment establishments from operating during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. “The FPI is not the enemy of the police or state. Sin is the FPI’s enemy,” Rizieq said in a speech at the event. He added the presence of Fauzi and Timur was proof of their support. In his speech, Fauzi said, “The city’s 2004 bylaw regulates the activities of night time entertainment venues in the month of Ramadan.” He told the public not to worry about the enforcement of the bylaw. “In some places where people continue to violate the law, we will act according to the rules,” he said. An observer quickly blasted the amiable relationship between the two sides. “Both the police and the governor are dumb. They should not pander to the FPI, which has a long history of committing violence in the city,” Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) researcher Syamsuddin Haris told The Jakarta Post on Saturday. He added that the presence of both city leaders was evidence that they indeed feared the FPI. “Any reason, including ‘we would do anything as long as the FPI doesn’t do anything violent’ is not acceptable. The two should not have surrendered and allowed themselves to be controlled by an organization that has violated the law many, many times,” Syamsuddin said. He emphasized that, “the police are the law enforcement body, not the FPI. The police have to enforce the law indiscriminately, including punishing them who violate the law, such as the FPI.” In April, a deadly riot broke out when thousands of public order officers backed by police clashed with locals reportedly supported by the FPI at a site in Koja, North Jakarta, which many believe to be the resting place of Muslim icon Mbah Priuk. Legal Aid Foundation director Nurkholis Hidayat said the “joint-forces plan” would only “support violence and strangle the public’s rights” of just law enforcement. Meanwhile, Jakarta Residents Forum (Fakta) chairman Azas Tigor Nainggolan said that, “Such a coalition would only prove that the city authorities are unable to provide public security.” (ipa)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/08/fauzi-police-chief-hobnob-with-fpi.html,,2010
"Mon, August 9 2010",FPI and low-income youths,"The Islam Defenders Front or FPI once again made a nasty story and appeared in most  Indonesian media. It was widely reported that a group of people allegedly related to the FPI recently attacked members of the Batak Christian Protestant Church (HKBP) from Pondok Timur Indah who were praying in a field in Ciketing Asem, Bekasi, last week. We also still remember when a mob of young men also allegedly related to the FPI raided Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) lawmakers and their audience in a public discussion about the health bill in Banyuwangi, East Java. Ironically, so far no significant action has been taken by the police of the perpetrators even though the FPI has been previously involved in many other aggressive and violent actions. The FPI’s assault on a transgender workshop in Depok, West Java, in May is still fresh in our memory. Many of us also still vividly remember an event in 2005, when the FPI bullied the organizers of an internationally important visual art exhibition in Jakarta by forcing it to take down Agus Suwage’s “Pinkswing Park” installation. Furthermore, they have demanded that Nyoman Nuarta’s “Three Girls” sculpture in Bekasi be taken down. Not to mention the FPI’s brutal attack on a peaceful rally of an alliance of civil organizations who promoted pluralism and minority rights in 2008 in Jakarta. It is noteworthy that several enlightened community and religious leaders as well as politicians have condemned the violent attitudes of the FPI and advocated the need to ban this organization. While these are necessary, it is also important to ask questions. How does the FPI attract and recruit numbers of young people, particularly young men, to join? Why are these young men willing to be involved in aggressive and violent attacks in the name of the FPI? It is not easy, and rigorous studies are urgently needed to answer these questions. However, we can reflect and analyze some anecdotal evidence related to the FPI. The media and several commentators have reported that the vast majority of FPI members are young men with limited education. They also come from urban poor neighborhoods in a number of Indonesian cities. It is therefore safe to say that most of these young men who join the FPI are either unemployed or underemployed. It is also worth mentioning that a plethora of studies in developed and developing countries have maintained that unemployment among young men should be viewed not merely as a deprivation of income but also a deprivation of dignity and identity. These studies further highlighted that unemployed young men are generally more susceptible to be engaged in risky activities including joining a violent gang or a violent organization. Their participation in a gang or in a violent organization may fill the void in their daily lives and provide them with an alternative identity as well as alternative source of power, however misguided. We can assume that by joining violent organizations these unemployed and economically marginalized young men can enjoy several material and non-material advantages including earning small pocket money, obtaining free food and clothing, and no less importantly, generating a reputation and creating for themselves prestige as tough men. In other words, these young men accomplish their masculine identity through their participation in this violent group in the context of their strained access to conventional means to achieve masculine status , for example, jobs and education. The presence of demagogues in this violent organization who are ready to manipulate religious issues and take advantage of poor young men’s desperation for identity and recognition, make this organization even more attractive. While it is important to condemn the aggressive attitudes of the FPI as well as advocate law enforcement agencies to take firm action and punish those involved in violent attitudes, it is not less important to provide more productive alternatives for these young disadvantaged men. Providing more access to education and employment for poor young people in disadvantaged urban neighborhoods in the long term, potentially reducing the attractiveness of violent organizations such as the FPI. Abundant studies have indicated that young people’s participation in gangs and violent groups and in offenses tend to significantly decrease when more constructive alternatives are widely available. These studies further highlight that employment does not merely manifest benefits for young people, for example regular income, but also generates latent benefits such as providing structured time, meaningful activities, a desirable and positive identity, as well as wider social contacts with mainstream society. These, in turn, may reduce young people’s participation in offenses and crime, as well as minimize the attractiveness to join gangs and violent organizations such as the FPI.

"Mon, August 9 2010",Attack on church sparks widespread outrage,"Muslims nationwide have condemned a hard-line Islamic organization for an attack on a church group on Sunday, saying the incident had tarnished the image of Islam. The public reaction surfaced in response to an assault allegedly carried out by the Islamic Community Forum (FUI) on Sunday morning against the HKBP Filadelfia church congregation in Bekasi, West Java, injuring about 20 people, mostly women. The attack, just one day after Jakarta Governor Fauzi Bowo and Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Timur Pradopo met with the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), an FUI affiliate, sparked outrage among people from social analysts to laymen. On the social networking website Twitter, the FPI was the fourth most discussed topic globally at press time on Sunday despite the group’s leader, Rizieq Shihab, having denied FPI’s involvement in the attack. One harsh “tweet” was posted by Wanda Chairunisa, who said: “FPI has no correlation with Islam, they don’t belong to Islam, they don’t even belong in this country.” Another topic under discussion titled Dismissing FPI (Bubarkan FPI) appeared on Twitter with posts denouncing the FPI as “Indonesia’s biggest enemy”. Most comments have called on the government to dismantle the hard-line organization, whose history is marred with violence. Sociologist Imam B. Prasodjo said strong reaction from the public was a sign of growing public impatience with the government’s policy of turning a blind eye to organizations that use certain beliefs to justify violence. “This is the climax of the government’s inaction to solve the problem,” he told The Jakarta Post. Hard-line Islamic groups, in-cluding the FPI, which was established in 1998, have been involved in several cases of violence in the country targeting minority groups such as Christians and followers of the Ahmadiyah sect of Islam. Sunday’s incident in Bekasi is the latest effort by hardliners to stop Christian congregations in the area. No investigations have been carried out to stop those responsible from carrying out further attacks despite efforts from the locals to report cases to the police and human rights commissions. Instead, the authorities have embraced the FPI, involving them in efforts to enforce a city bylaw banning entertainment centers from operating during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. This close relationship became apparent Saturday with the attendance of Governor Fauzi and city police chief Timur at the 12th anniversary of the FPI at the organization’s headquarters in Petamburan, Central Jakarta. The visit by Jakarta’s two highest authorities confirmed their support for the FPI, while just a day earlier, a FPI leader visited Jakarta Police to offer their service in enforcing the city’s bylaws. The move has received strong criticism from the public. “Fauzi was supported by many parties to become Jakarta governor because of his pluralist platform. [But] now he embraces the [non-pluralist] FPI. Surprising,” Muslim scholar Ulil Abshar Abdalla posted on Twitter. Analysts also believe that the authority’s apparent coalition with hard-liners will only prove its inability to protect the public. congregation page 17",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/09/attack-church-sparks-widespread-outrage.html,,2010

"Tue, August 10 2010",Letter: FPI government recognition,"I refer to the page 1 reports in the Aug. 7 and Aug. 8 editions of The Jakarta Post regarding the recent “offer of law enforcement help” made by the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) to the Jakarta Police, and the subsequent attendance by the Jakarta Police chief and the Jakarta governor at the FPI’s 12th anniversary celebrations. While seemingly innocuous, these developments should be of great concern to all thinking Indonesians. The FPI’s supposed offer to support law enforcement may be properly interpreted as actually containing an implicit threat by the FPI — if the police do not enforce the law in a manner acceptable for the FPI, the FPI will assume the role of law enforcement. At the same time, by attending the FPI celebrations, in their official capacities, Jakarta’s Police chief and Governor Fauzi Bowo are implying legitimate public recognition of a private militia group with a history of breaking the law. Indonesians should remember the unhappy experiences of Germany and Italy in the 1920s and 1930s, when mainstream politicians thought they could co-opt the “Brown Shirts” (Germany’s unruly and violent Nazi militia) and the “Black Shirts” (Italy’s equally unruly and violent Fascist militia) to serve their own ends, only to find that in so doing they had inadvertently opened a Pandora’s Box which ultimately consumed both countries in World War II. Likewise, one might make reference to Indonesia’s own struggle for independence following the end of World War II, when the hard-pressed republican government enlisted Japanese-trained militia groups and criminal gangs to prevent the return of Dutch colonialists. These extra-judicial forces had hidden agendas and were abusive and inherently uncontrollable. The end result of this opportunistic collaboration caused serious damage to both domestic and international perceptions of the legitimacy of Indonesia’s republican aspirations. In the final analysis, and regardless of any short term uses they may seem to have, there is no legitimate role in a civil society for private militia groups such as the FPI. Law enforcement is the responsibility of the police. If the police are not appropriately enforcing the law, then the solution should be police reform, not de facto subcontracting of police responsibilities to the FPI. Likewise, politicians who wittingly or unwittingly allow themselves to associate with the FPI are likely to find that the FPI actually aims to set the agenda and dictate the course of events. The politicians are sidelined, and are powerless to stop the FPI from doing whatever it pleases. History has a disconcerting habit of repeating itself, and people rarely seem to learn from past mistakes. Hopefully Indonesians will see the FPI for what it really is, and prevent the FPI from gaining serious power, something which would surely imperil Indonesia’s nascent democratic development.

"Wed, August 11 2010",Letter: The attack,"The recent attack on churchgoers in Bekasi, West Java, is horrifying and I’m utterly disgusted by the events that unfolded. For years, other countries have developed and openly understand and respect other people’s beliefs. But for some religious reasons, there are still some fanatic Indonesians out there (the FPI) bashing their own brothers and sisters in the name of religion! I just don’t understand it. This is part of the reason why many Indonesians, especially those from minority groups, choose to move out of the country and proudly renounce their citizenship. Everybody in this world longs to live peacefully and lovingly towards one another but this violence has turned your own people away due to a lack of trust and security. I haven’t been able to trust law enforcers ever since the violence of 1998. As long as this same violence continues to reoccur, it will smear Indonesia’s reputation around the world, breaking our brother/sisterhood relationship. I don’t blame anybody but the FPI, which is an abrasive and corrosive organization with a narrow mind set. I don’t really understand politics, and I am not interested in discussing it, but I am interested in what they taught us in primary school during weekly assemblies every Monday and on Indonesia’s independence day on TV “Pancasila”. I can no longer recall the five principles of Pancasila but I do remember freedom of religion is incorporated among them. Yet some Indonesian terrorists and the FPI rather fill their brains with violence than having to abide with the constitution of Pancasila. Then, what was the point of standing out in the sun every Monday morning shouting “Pancasila!” I distinctly remember the beauty of those days. “Deeds and not words are what count the most!” I’m sorry I’m sick of thinking about the riots and all the chaos, the hypocrisy of how rules and things are made in Indonesia. I was born in Indonesia and it’s a beautiful country. We all love the country, but some Indonesians have left Jakarta for fear and horror that disturbs their peaceful way of life. If only the FPI could show love instead of baleful attitudes, you could probably attract more peaceful people to your beloved religion.  I reckon what goes around comes around.

"Thu, August 12 2010",Hostile groups No. 1 foe of press freedom: AJI,"A report released Wednesday said hostile mass organizations were the leading enemy of press freedom and documented threats and violence directed at journalists. The Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) said it had recorded 40 cases of violence directed at journalists and media workers over the last year, adding that most of the perpetrators acted as part of mass organizations. AJI chairman Nezar Patria said that hostile mass organizations were “the leading enemy” of press freedom in 2010. Margiyono, AJI’s coordinator for advocacy, said there were 10 cases of assault committed by violent mass organizations against journalists. He said this year saw a shift in who had perpetrated violence against media workers. “Last year we noted that the police had done most of the oppression committed against journalists, but this year, violent mass organizations have smashed that record,” he said, adding that 38 cases of violence were documented last year. Some incidents involved Islam Defenders Front (FPI) members, who were alleged to have assaulted Lampu Hijau reporter Octabryan Purwo during a liquor raid in the Petamburan, Central Jakarta, in 2009. The FPI and the Anti-Communist Front allegedly collaborated to intimidated reporters of the Jawa Pos after the newspaper published a biography of Soemarsono, a former Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) member and a key figure in the Battle of Surabaya during the Indonesian National Revolution. Members of the Hisbullah group from Sunan Bonang division were alleged to have intimidated a Solo Radio crew in Surakarta in September 2009, according to AJI. Another mass organization prohibited journalists from TVOne from reporting on a terrorist-related incident in Jatiasih, Bekasi, last August, the report said. Margiyono said the growing number of assaults on journalists perpetrated by mass organizations stemmed from the nation’s dysfunctional system of law enforcement. “We reported all these cases to the police, but they never took action against the perpetrators. It seems as if the law is weak and thus members of mass organizations act as if they are above the law,” he added. According to the report, assault was the most brutal violence perpetrated against journalists. AJI recorded 12 assaults in the 12-month period ending in August 2010: five incidents of mob assaults, three perpetrated by mass organizations and one case of assault by university students. AJI said that mass organizations, politicians, mobs and unknown individuals have threatened or attempted to intimidate members of the Indonesian media and that there were eight such cases to date this year. The institute also said that censors also attempted to control the press, adding that there were six of such instances to date this year, all committed by local government officials, including personnel from local hospitals. Journalists have also been subjected to legal repression via criminal or civil defamation suits or witness subpoena requests. The police were involved in three cases, while politicians and private citizens each filed one case. Confiscation of equipment occurred four times, AJI says, with bureaucrats, private security guards, mass organization members and an unknown individual as perpetrators. Most of the cases took place in Jakarta. North Sumatra, East Java and Yogyakarta each recorded four incidents or press violence and Papua and West Nusa Tenggara each recorded three cases.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/12/hostile-groups-no-1-foe-press-freedom-aji.html,,2010
"Thu, August 12 2010","Issue: Governor, police chief hobnob with FPI","Aug. 7, Online: Jakarta Governor Fauzi Bowo and Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Timur Pradopo attended the 12th anniversary celebration of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) at the organization’s headquarters in Petamburan, Central Jakarta, on Saturday, drawing criticism that both leaders feared the hard-line group. Fauzi and Timur’s attendance comes a day after FPI leader Habib Rizieq visited Jakarta Police headquarters to “offer the group’s services” in enforcing a city bylaw banning some entertainment establishments from operating during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.

Your comments: Appeasement is wrong. Enforcement is right. Are our police so weak that we have to bow down to evil? Arie Susanto Jakarta Whatever it was that Fauzi and Timur discussed with FPI, it was clearly a dismal failure at averting the descent into anarchy at the hands of FPI. And I am sure that is how FPI wanted it to be seen by attacking a church and churchgoers in less than 24 hours following discussions. It is time to up the ante and bring in the big guns against this cancerous street violence. If the governor of Jakarta has failed then it falls to SBY to show some leadership on this issue. We need to remember that the FPI has grown and operated with total impunity during his watch.

"Fri, August 13 2010",Insight: No political salvation will come from tribalism,"It started as a media attraction on Aug. 6 when the leader of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) visited Jakarta Police headquarters to offer the group’s services to enforce city bylaws. As an institution that is increasingly losing public respect, the police looked like a neglected lover in need of instant endearment. I doubt if the police were so naïve, but it is not uncommon for anyone desperate for recognition to be blinded by the need for public acceptance. The next day, when the governor and the Jakarta Police chief attended the 12th anniversary celebration of the FPI, it was clear that something had gone awry. The occasion was public, but what took place resembled a secret deal struck by the denizens of the Jakarta underworld. After a torrent of public ire emerged, a war of semantics ensued. The FPI’s leader insisted that the attendance of the Jakarta governor and the Jakarta Police chief was only to support the group, whereas the police declined to make such a claim. It was only a matter of course that before the public immediately decided that the police and the governor had acted out of fear. It is indeed outrageous that the guardians of public order made an apparent concession to an organization with a notorious record of carrying out violence and disturbances of public order. But things may not be as they appear. Already some quarters have raised the tempting idea that perhaps the police and the governor simply accommodated the group as a way of containing its unbridled violence and vigilante-style attacks. Indeed, the tactic of containment is common enough in the underworld of politics, business and street gangs. The principle is plain: It is better to keep an ogre inside your garden than letting it loose. The logic of containment is bound to fail, and it will fail without delay. First, to have the likes of FPI supporting law enforcement can only mean anointing the group as a law enforcement agency. This is utterly unacceptable. Second, to have groups such as the FPI supporting law enforcement is to accommodate the FPI’s ideological mission. Even for many Muslim communities, let alone for the other groups comprising Indonesia, this is a recipe for a collective suicide. Most laughable is perhaps to have a governor and police chief who cannot distinguish a wedding reception from a hard-line group’s anniversary celebration. All this mirrors something that is more disturbing. Despite our regular claim to democratic reform, the nature of politics in this country remains quintessentially tribal and atavistic. In order to get their way, even the guardians of public order have succumbed to tribalism and atavism. The suavity of parliamentary debates and the finesse of media politics that are shown to us every day are in the end a game of deception for a political underworld that is even darker than hell. What is really at stake then? First, the bigots have arrived at the gate and are ready to make the guardians of public order look toothless. The more concessions are made, the more draconian the steps to be taken to recover ground. This is a throwback to something that is even bleaker that the authoritarian past. Second, if this pattern keeps on recurring, even the  governor or the Jakarta Police chief may become irrelevant. It is another way of saying that they may lose their reason for being state apparatuses. If the phrase “the absence of the state” is now in wide currency, it is precisely due to this sort of predicament. Third, a more subtle problem is also lurking in the wings. This concerns the fate of our dream to live in a healthy plural society. Gone will be the dream Indonesia as Bhinneka Tunggal Ika (unity in diversity), for the tribal and parochial will overtake the principle of citizenship. Fourth, to take the point a step further, tribalism will in turn change the landscape of Indonesian politics to be decided not by public reasoning, let alone by the decorum of a shared quest for the common good, but instead by a sheer assertion of physical force. This last point may sound overstated but it may also explain why Indonesian politics has a tendency to slip back into physical brutality and atavism. It is appealing to entertain the idea that social justice will heal the political wounds and mitigate the current virulence of sectarianism, radicalism and tribalism in this country, but this kind of explanation is more idealistic than practical. In the absence of a robust account, I have for some time entertained a curiosity that the material ground of the present situation may have its basis in the emergence of hard-line groups in 1998. It is no longer a secret that some armed groups then were vigilantes encouraged by some leader of the Indonesian Military, then lodged in fierce power struggles. Of course all this does not prevent them from gradually having a life of their own. But I would be surprised if the continuing presence of these groups as a trump card does not remain important in the current political underworld in Indonesia, even if their origins started in the barracks. It is enough for us to be alarmed by the unpleasant prospect that these groups will stubbornly persist. Indeed, while every day we are shown media-savvy spectacles of democratic politics, what really works deep down are political decisions made by the brute forces of tribalism. All may have started as a congratulatory cheer at the FPI’s 12th anniversary. But what the Jakarta Police chief and the governor have done reveals something grave: It is sheer feebleness of the guardians of the Republic to conquer the brute forces of physical pressure. No wonder many problems that concern the physical and material survival of so many people are unattended by state apparatuses that we have elect and to solve them.

"Sat, August 14 2010",Piety cannot be forced by the FPI or anyone,"Devout Muslims are now fasting as part of the Ramadan holy month under political stability and a buoyant economic outlook with the only threat to the serenity expected to come from hard-line religious organizations such as the Islamic Community Forum (FUI), which flexed its muscles recently by attacking a church congregation in Bekasi, West Java. The threat should not be taken lightly because such groups are currently enjoying a stronger presence since authorities recently and openly embraced the notorious Islam Defender’s Front (FPI). The support was exhibited by a visit to the group’s headquarters by city authorities for the FPI’s 12th anniversary on Saturday. The city police also plans to involve FPI in efforts to enforce city bylaws that ban entertainment centers from operating in the fasting month. The move enhances FPI’s power and has widely been seen as deplorable because by embracing FPI, the authorities have given their blessings to vigilante groups to police the community, emboldening all hard-line movements. The support boosts FPI confidence and, if the police fail to monitor them, attacks on churches and raids on entertainment centers during Ramadan are expected to become more frequent. It is a setback that, during the holy month of Ramadan, communities will be under tighter surveillance by vigilantes like the FPI. The groups’ much anticipated expanding presence during Ramadan surely induces fear not only among non-Muslims and expatriates, but among Muslims themselves. Muslims are not all devout, and average or non-practicing Muslims, who like to visit entertainment centers after work will feel that they are having their freedoms curtailed. The surveillance also runs against the spirit of Ramadan itself. In performing the fast, Muslims are taught to be responsible. Refraining from eating, having sex and other things prohibited during the month of Ramadan should come from self-conscience and cannot be imposed by others. Performing religious tenets is divine vertical interaction between human and God, and nobody can interfere. For non-Muslims, the hardliners have no right whatsoever to force them to relinquish their regular habits during Ramadan for the sake of respecting Muslims performing fast. It is certainly a civic duty for non-Muslims to respect Muslims who are fasting, but no one has the right to force that respect by limiting people’s personal freedoms. The organization also has no right to participate in the enforcement of city bylaws on the grounds that it is the task of the Public Order Agency. Outsourcing civic duty assignments to the FPI is a dangerous idea given that, unlike public order officers or the police, FPI members are not trained in policing people. Previous experiences of FPI raids turning ugly at the cost of not only the image of the FPI but also Islam should serve as a lesson for everybody that the duty to police the community should only be vested to trained institutions. It is refreshing to see that the outcry against the violence of the FPI has come not only come from the parties targeted by hardliners, such as expatriates, non-Muslims, non-practicing Muslims and entertainment operators; but from devout Muslims. Thanks to Twitter, Facebook and other social media, the movement against the hard-line groups has mushroomed among Muslims generating outrage against the actions of the hardliners that manipulate religion for their own gain. The Muslim resistance shows that the majority of Muslims still have a healthy sense in dealing with issues that concern the adherents of other faiths and will surely help lift the image of Islam as religion of peace and tolerance. The case in point here was the visit of Fahira Idris, the daughter of former manpower minister Fahmi Idris to FPI headquarters in Central Jakarta on Monday to appeal to the organization to avoid violence and have tolerance for others during Ramadan. The key to successful fasting is among Muslims themselves. If the Muslims can overcome temptations during Ramadan by themselves and not have to be forced to do so by others such as the FPI, they will surely reveive greater rewards from God.

"Sat, August 14 2010",Commentary: What I wish to tell the FPI leader: Corruption is our No. 1 enemy,"“Why did you like to sing gospels for the dead these last two days?” my daughter asked me on Friday morning. She was curious because usually I love to sing songs that, according to her mother, do not suit my age. It was just a coincidence. Since Wednesday I had tried very hard to gather enough courage to make an appeal to the leader of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) Muhammad Rizieq Shihab. In the last three days, every time I read newspaper files about his activities and looked at his pictures, I felt as if I heard threatening voices: “Who do you think you are that you want to criticize this widely feared person? Even President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has never openly said anything negative about his activities.” I was sweating. Worse, when I tried to search FPI on Google, I often found the following message: Bandwidth Limit Exceeded. I was very willing to make a friendly suggestion to Bapak Rizieq that it would be much more productive for this country if he and his followers helped the nation wage a jihad against Indonesia’s most dangerous disease: corruption! I wish I could convince him that the sons and daughters of this nation should call for a total war against corrupt people. Millions of citizens are forced to live under the poverty line because our state assets, our natural resources are being robbed by our leaders, their cronies and their bribers. I would like to tell him gently: We should use peaceful, legitimate but effective ways in our bid to eliminate the crime, which does not only ruin our economy but also turn us into a laughing stock in the world community. How come a nation, whose people are very proud to call themselves religious, cannot shake off the title of one of world’s most corrupt countries? I could not resist the temptation to go to Rizieq, who has many ardent followers. I am sure he also is deeply concerned about the country’s most acute social disease. Corruption is considered a sin by all religions. Please forgive me if I decide to come to him, because many Indonesians agree with me that we must think “out of the box” in eradicating corruption. Go to parliament members? Look what they have done. Go to the President? Go to our political elites whose mouths never stop preaching about good governance? These officials and politicians, before taking office, swore in the name of God with the Bible, Koran or other holy books on their hands or heads that they would not commit any form of corruption and abuse of power. To be honest I felt anxious: Would the well known Muslim preacher be upset by my decision to give him a “friendly suggestion”? Would his followers beat me for humiliating their adored leader in public? Right or wrong, there exists a frightening image of him among non-Muslims such as myself. But I was very eager to prove that the public perception that he and his followers were violent and intolerant was wrong. After reading many articles about the preacher and focusing closer on his pictures in the newspapers and on the Internet, I heard a voice from deep within my heart: just do it! Ustadz Rizieq dedicates his life to Islam, a very tolerant, peaceful and forgiving religion. “Just look at his smile. Initially you may feel scared, but if you concentrate more there is a wisdom and sincerity there,” the voice continued. I remember the advice of my foster parents Kartijo and Ngatinem, who circumcised me when I was still I a little boy but never changed my religion. “Islam brings peace and prosperity for all, not just for us Muslims,” said the illiterate Javanese farmers. Safety first! The motto is commonly seen at construction sites as a reminder to employers and workers that human safety rises above everything else, including possible material loss. Our publicly elected leaders such as President Yudhoyono and Jakarta Governor Fauzi Bowo are very quick to implement the two-word advice when they are required to by the Constitution to protect citizens from corruptors, human rights abusers and those who claim they are authorized by God to do anything they like against others whom they don’t like. When houses of worship are attacked, they seem to be deaf and mute. Safety first! To make sure that everybody likes him and that his popularity remains high, President Yudhoyono keeps pretending not to hear or know about the mass of public complaints and suspicion about rampant corruption practiced by the generals of the National Police, and by prosecutors at the Attorney General’s Office. The President apparently feels comfortable enough with his position as the leader of the country until 2014. Taking harsh action against corruptors and power abusers would only create unnecessary threats to the safety of his presidential seat. So where else I can go? To the FPI leader! I forgive readers who brand me as naïve or stupid with this idea. But if Pak Rizieq reads this column, I am sure he will shake my hand and say: “Trust me, fighting corruption is my top priority Let us do it now.” And he will show me a peace sign.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/14/commentary-what-i-wish-tell-fpi-leader-corruption-our-no-1-enemy.html,,2010
"Sat, August 14 2010","Letter: Yes, SBY may hear us","I refer to an article titled “The President hears you”, (Aug. 12) written by presidential spokesman Julian Aldrin Pasha. The President may hear us this time. But is it because the victim ofthe attack is HKBP, a gregarious ethnic-religious group that mayretaliate — and that there is the potential for tit-for-tat escalating violence. So the President chooses to hear this time? Where was the President when the FPI attacked other minor religiousgroups, suburban business owners, and other ethnic groups for years? The President did not hear because these people can be ignored politically. They have been doing this kind of outlaw activities for a long time.Even the police stand aside because they are afraid of retaliation orhave the same view of how “disturbances” to Muslim prayer should behandled. There is no rule of law, even among the police, only the law of the jungle. Perhaps the President should also think of potential insubordinationamong his senior police officers. The President was recently sidesteppedwhen the police presented him with a list of candidates for NationalPolice chief. There are a large number of fat police bank accounts which are still unexplained. The police force is totally unreformed. These are fundamental problemsthat our executive arm needs to address, if it wants to be effective,rather than just rhetoric and gaining the support of the majority. You may have heard us this time, but you should have heard all of uslong time ago. We need to see results. We had high hopes for you when wevoted for you. This is your final term in office.

"Sat, August 14 2010",Comment: FPI chief criticizes media,"Aug. 9, Online: Islam Defenders Front (FPI) chief Muhammad Rizieq Shihab condemned themedia for biased reporting of FPI activities. “The media has presentedmisleading information,” Rizieq said Monday, as quoted bytempointeraktif.com, adding that the media blames the FPI wheneverviolations occur. The media’s reportage of FPI activities is imbalanced, Rizieq said. Rizieq mentioned a recent raid of a healthcare discussion in Banyuwangi,East Java, allegedly launched by FPI members and another alleged FPIattack on Christians in Bekasi, West Java.  “No one apologized after it was disclosed that the attackers were not members of FPI,” Rizieq said. Your comments: The FPI creates mayhem. It’s the FPI attack dogs that should receive an apology when people defend themselves? It’s far too late for the FPI to claim to be the wronged party. Their anarchic violence is reminiscent of Germany in the late 1930s,where a similar group of dogmatic totalitarian vigilantes denied thepopulation of that country the freedom, which eventually led to a globalconflict. This fate could easily befall Indonesia, if the police remain impotentand fail to protect the citizens from this blatant violence and continueto ignore the principle of Indonesia’s Pancasila. The damage to Indonesia’s global reputation will likely be irreversible. Diggas Pekalongan",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/14/comment-fpi-chief-criticizes-media.html,,2010
"Mon, August 16 2010",Letter: Call for religious understanding,"Ramadan officially began on Aug. 11, heralding a month of prayers, peace, and self-discipline. Yet the start of the Ramadan month this year has been somewhat of a sensitive topic because it means Idul Fitri falls on Sept. 11. Clearly I do not have to say much or explain why that might be a problem because the entire world knows the tragic events of that particular day. Recently, conflicts between the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and HKBP church in Bekasi have angered many Indonesians and shown us that problems between Muslims and Christians in Indonesia are far from settled. Surprisingly enough, the same problem is occurring in the United States. I was just watching Anderson Cooper (AC) 360 on CNN, where the big debate in the US is whether to build a mosque near the World Trade Center site. Instead of people debating whether or not the mosque should be built, many Americans are opining their hatred of Islam. During that particular episode of AC 360, a reverend was being interviewed who did not support the mosque being built. As he was being interviewed by the host, he made the generalization that all Muslims are terrorists. Bear in my mind that this is the opinion of a reverend, which came as a shock to me because, of all the people in the world, it should be religious clerics setting good examples for their followers. The reverend had some preconceived notions about the religion of Islam, all of which were negative and it got me to thinking on when this issue between Muslims and Christians will ever end. It is a rhetorical question because we are all aware this issue has been going on for centuries. Personally, I feel that one of the key elements creating friction between Muslims and Christians is the lack of understanding each religion has toward one another and the generalization of both religions. Indonesia is home to the largest Muslim population in the world, and is able to prove that Muslims can coexist with Christians, because Christianity is also considered a religion. Yes, Indonesia has had its fair share of religious conflicts in the past but we have passed that phase where we are able to live in peace side-by-side with Muslim and Christian brothers alike. We are a prime example to show to the world that not all Muslims are terrorists because we have to remind the world that there are moderate Muslims and extremist Muslims. Indeed the religion of Islam has been tainted by the tragic events of Sept. 11, 2001, which has shaped many people’s negative opinions toward the religion. However this is Ramadan, when we shall call for peace and an end to hatred toward one another. As for the adults that have led the FPI to attack the HKBP, ask yourself what message you are trying to convey to today’s generation. Indonesians want to see more of its people be religiously tolerant and to develop and bring this country forward in every single aspect, so why try to go backwards? It wold be a shame for Indonesia to be divided by religion, and that is why the country should aspire for religious understanding and set an example to the world that Muslims can live alongside Christians in peace.

"Thu, August 19 2010","Letter: FPI, Pancasila and the govt","The attack on the (Batak Pastoral Church) HKBP congregation by the IslamDefenders Front (FPI) on Aug. 7 has evoked public demand to disband theorganization. Previously, the FPI has carried out several attacks thatwere mostly based upon a religious rationale, as they freely admitted. The HKBP attack might be the apex for the public, whereby the FPI is nowperceived as a violent and cruel organization. Indonesian Muslims mightsimply oppose the FPI and label them as deviant, to undertake suchattacks in the name of Islam, as they say Islam does not teach violence. If we refer to the Pancasila state ideology, the stance against the FPImight be strengthened. As an essential basis of being Indonesian,Pancasila is aimed at cultivating a pluralistic perspective in everyIndonesian. We are taught to be respectful, tolerant and fair. I believethe FPI has violated all the values within Pancasila. Since they were disrespectful to the non-Muslim community by attackingthem, it is a violation of article one and two of Pancasila ondisregarding others’ divinity and humanity. It could be considered neglecting the essence of the third article too,as they generated disorder, which threatens unity. The fourth and fiftharticles were also contravened through them resolving problems, notthrough discussion but by attacking, and by ignoring social justice. Having said that, when I referred to an opinion article by SudirmanNasir published in The Jakarta Post on Aug. 8, I paused to rethink.  Itwrote that the FPI mostly comprised of unemployed and/or underemployedyouths. They were easily recruited because of the lack of availabilityof ways for them to form an identity, and as a recognition ofmasculinity. This power was undoubtedly channeled in the wrongdirection. An ignorant government that is careless in governing the people causesthis phenomenon, in my view. It is the government that provides almostno means for youths to educate and develop themselves responsibly. Yet,simply presenting the problem is not enough; a solution is required toovercome it. Regarding the composition of the FPI members, mostly these youthsseeking a sense of identity, they would be better channeled into a youtharmy corps. The government should be asked to generate such corps sothat the power of Indonesian young people could be useful rather thandestructive. They could act as backup for the existing IndonesiaMilitary (TNI). They could fight for Indonesia and undertake projects for the sake ofthe nation. Surely, this sounds a better way. Furthermore, I predict theyouths would not refuse recruitment, since the motive of beingrecognized as strong and extremely masculine would be gratified.

"Fri, August 27 2010",Supreme Court order threatens press freedom,"A court ruling against the former chief editor of Playboy Indonesia, Erwin Arnada, sets a bad precedent, threatening the freedom of the press, the Press Council says. Council member Agus Sudibyo told The Jakarta Post on Thursday that the ruling could set a precedent for similar cases in the future. The Supreme Court in July 2009 granted an appeal lodged by prosecutors and sentenced Erwin to two years’ imprisonment after finding him guilty of public indecency. Public indecency is regulated in the Criminal Code. The South Jakarta District Court had cleared Erwin of charges in 2007, saying prosecutors should have charged him with articles in the 1999 Press Freedom Law. Agus said that with the Supreme Court ruling, “if in future there are people who dislike or feel threatened by media coverage they will be able to use the Criminal Code or other laws other than the press law.” The Press Council, he said, slammed the Supreme Court ruling because it was issued without taking the press law into consideration, when it was very clear that the now-defunct Playboy magazine was a product of journalism. The local edition of the US-based magazine sparked controversy when it was first launched in 2006. Only a week after the first edition was published, members of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) attacked the Playboy Indonesia editorial office in South Jakarta, injuring two policemen as they pelted the building with rocks, shattering windows and terrifying tenants. FPI members then reported the magazine, which contained no nudity, to police for allegedly violating public indecency laws. The South Jakarta District Court ruled that Erwin had not violated the law by publishing the magazine. Presiding judge Efran Basuning said photographs presented as evidence during Erwin’s trial could not be categorized as pornography. Erwin praised the verdict as a victory for press freedom in Indonesia. Rudy Satrio, a legal expert from the University of Indonesia, said he supported the ruling made by the lower court. “If [the magazine] indeed contained material that violated public decency or pornography [laws], the publisher should be punished, not the individuals. “The press law should have been applied,” Rudy told the Post. He also said the Supreme Court had “made a mistake” by sentencing (Playboy’s) chief editor to imprisonment. “The press law regulates violations committed by the press as a company while the Criminal Code regulates crimes committed by individuals. The Supreme Court should draw a line there,” he said, adding that Erwin was only a representative of a company that published the magazine. The Supreme Court justice presiding over the case, Mansur Kartayasa, said he planned to clarify the legal reasoning behind the verdict today. Court spokesman Hatta Ali told the Post on Thursday that he was unable to comment on the matter. South Jakarta Prosecutor’s Office said Wednesday it had received a copy of the ruling and would arrest Erwin immediately. Office chief Muhammad Yusuf said he had sent Erwin a summons, but that the letter had not reached Erwin. “Our data shows that he lives in Bendungan Hilir, but when we sent the letter there, the neighborhood chief said [Erwin] had moved.” Yusuf said his office would issue three summons before declaring Erwin a fugitive. According to Erwin’s Twitter account, @erwinarnanda, he is still in Jakarta. “One thing is for sure. I am not running away,” he said in one of his tweets on Thursday. Erwin said he would stand up for Playboy Indonesia, which he says was not a pornographic publication. The exclusive interviews in the magazine had been with prominent figures including novelist Pra-moedya Ananta Toer, writer Goenawan Mohamad and artist Butet Kartaredjasa, he said. “Would they have been willing to be interviewed exclusively had Playboy Indonesia been a pornographic magazine?” he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/27/supreme-court-order-threatens-press-freedom.html,,2010
"Fri, August 27 2010",FPI vows to retaliate over Koran burning,"The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) has vowed to retaliate if a US-based militant Christian group goes ahead with its “World Koran Burning Day” campaign in observance of 9/11. FPI chairman Habib Rizieq made the threat during a meeting with leaders of an interfaith group in Jakarta on Wednesday. He stopped short of being specific. “We have plans. Just wait and see what we will do,” he said. Rizieq said it was not enough for local religious leaders to simply condemn the Koran-burning plan. He said they must take “concrete action” so that the US government stop the campaign. “Indonesian Muslims will be angry if the Koran is burned and [the FPI] will not blame them if they retaliate here at home,” he said. The “World Koran Burning Day” campaign has been planned by the Gainesville, a Florida-based Dove World Outreach Center, which states on its website and Facebook page the day is “in remembrance of the fallen victims of 9/11 and to stand against ... Islam”. The campaign has been condemned by Indonesian interfaith leaders, who have demanded the Obama administration stop it. The FPI is notorious for its use of violence as a means to achieve its goals. Dialogue was held Wednesday to discuss the latest religious conflicts both at home and abroad, and how Indonesia should respond to the issues. On the domestic front, interfaith leaders raised the recent spate of religious violence allegedly involving hard-line Islamic groups such as the FPI. The latest major incident was an attack on the congregation of the HKBP church in Bekasi. The two-hour meeting facilitated by the International Conference of Islamic Scholars (ICIS) failed to reach any conclusion on how to end the violence, which is widely feared to worsen and threaten Indonesia’s integrity as a pluralist nation. Indonesian Communion of Churches (PGI) chairman Andreas Yewangu expressed his great concern over the attacks and forcible closure of churches and their worshippers, which he said were against the freedom of religion guaranteed by the Constitution. “We are truly sad about what has happened over the past few months. The violence committed in the name of religion cannot be justified and must be stopped otherwise it may trigger a domino effect that can lead to the nation fragmenting,” he said ICIS secretary-general Hasyim Muzadi underlined the need for religious communities to respect citizens’ constitutional right to worship wherever and whenever they wanted. “Nobody but the government has the authority to enforce the law and offenses should be referred to the police to handle,” he said. Indonesian Pentacostal Church chairman Rev. Robinson Nainggolan questioned the FPI’s motives behind the frequent raids on places of worship. Pentacostal churches are the most targeted, he said. He also lambasted the government and security authorities, which he said failed to take necessary measures against the Islamic mass organization and its members involved in raids. “We are aware of the reality that Christianity along with Buddhism and Hinduism are minorities in the country, but all sides should bear in mind that all communities are equal before the law. The government must take action against any sides taking the law into their hands,” he said. Rizieq has denied the accusations, saying the FPI respected other religions and shun violence.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/27/fpi-vows-retaliate-over-koran-burning.html,,2010
"Mon, August 30 2010",Yellow card for President Yudhoyono,"Due to Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s (SBY) sluggish and infirm response to religious violence and intolerance, a yellow card should be issued. A whistle should be blown. Halt the train for a moment, time for reflection. A referee should warn Ruhut Sitompul — a Democrat politician and a member of the House of Representatives who fished in the murky water to test the public — not to even think of a third term. “Behold SBY!” (Please forgive the referee who substitutes Ruhut’s name for SBY, or on the other way around). “Your record is yellow, close to red.” Be serious. A yellow card means warning, whereas a red one means stop – enough is enough. Please, never turn the yellow into a red card. A green card — meaning peace, environmentally friendly, a card issued by the US government to allow non-US citizens to work there, and that the show must go on – is preferable. Ruhut beat the drum, echoing the possibility of SBY’s third term, ironically amid the fire directed at SBY’s lame duck. The nickname “Mr. Doubter” lingers. Minority groups, for example, members of Ahmadiyah and Christians, become the target of attack by the hardliners, for example the Islamic Community Forum (FUI) andthe Islam Defenders Front (FPI), whose leaders and members never give up exhibiting their shallow rhetoric in the public. When a chance came, they seized it. There is always a temptation in their minds, whenever streets and roads are empty,  to hold mass rally. They feel invited whenever an issue can be twisted. Issues surrounding Ahmadiyah and Indonesian Christians, which the FPI still want to sell, are old. Indeed, nobody, except the FPI and the like, want to buy it. True, until early 20th century, Muslims and Christians were suspicious of each other, due to complicated elements of the native Indonesians, the Dutch government, and inter-religious relations. Th. Sumartana, a pioneer of inter-religious dialogue, has touched upon this issue. However, Christianization in Indonesia, which concerned both most Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah leaders from the 1970s to 1980s, is a sheer myth, which the New Order regime used very well in the effort of managing the conflict between Muslims and Christians for the benefits of the government (it sounds like divide et impera, divide and rule). An Indonesian scholar, Mujiburrahman, wrote this. Back to the point. Mosques and churches, built by minorities, are now in danger. Religious harmony and tolerance are in peril. Religious and ethnic diversity, which should be part of Indonesians’ identity, are threatened. It is a paradox that the Americans are now discussing whether a mosque can be built at Ground Zero, the World Trade Center (WTC) site in Manhattan, New York city — the target of the 9/11 attack. The Americans are debating how to differentiate between true Islam and al-Qaeda, between moderate Muslims and radicals, and between religion and fundamentalism. But here in Indonesia, people are witnessing that mosques and churches have been destroyed. People performing religious rites are ambushed. What a shame. Once again, in his second term, can SBY appear in the public with steadfastness and audacity? In theory, he must be. He was elected with a landslide victory. The Indonesians gave mandate wholeheartedly. However, it is up to SBY alone to show us that he deserves this second chance. Thus, the speed should be accelerated, the seatbelt should be fastened, the steadfastness should be shown, and the audacity should be exhibited. All of this should be done, before a red card becomes a theme in the public. Note that SBY and all his staff know very well that only one factor such as religious intolerance will unlikely lead the President to step down. You know, both Sukarno’s and Soeharto’s tumble was due to more complex factors, for example, the economy, and political and social mayhem. Nonetheless, keep reminding SBY to guard our harmonious diversity. Do not forget that there are also more issues in the limelight. SBY’s commitment to eradication of corruption is lately questionable. Some of those who were jailed due to corruption cases have been granted remission. Additionally, the dignity of Indonesians may have been disturbed again, and the government’s reputation in defending its own citizens and solving the problem appropriately is at stake. Hundreds of Indonesian migrant workers are faced with the death penalty in Malaysia. Ruhut never dares to announce the third term of SBY in a microphone with confidence. Behave Ruhut, behold SBY.

"Tue, August 31 2010",Police want violent groups disbanded,"National Police chief Gen. Bambang Hendarso Danuri said in Jakarta on Monday that violent mass organizations had to be temporarily banned or permanently disbanded. “There have to be sanctions by freezing mass organizations that repeatedly commit acts of violence,” Bambang said at a joint hearing with members of the House of Representatives’ Commission II on Domestic Affairs, Commission III on Law and Commission VIII on Religious Affairs. Bambang was accompanied at the hearing by Attorney General Hendarman Supandji, Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali, Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Djoko Suyanto, Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi, Justice and Human Rights Minister Patrialis Akbar and State Intelligence Agency (BIN) chief Sutanto. Bambang disclosed that between 2007 and 2010, there were 107 incidents of violent outbreaks by these groups, of which 36 had complete case files. Most of the incidents listed were perpetrated by the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), the Betawi Council Forum (FBR) and the Betawi Youth Front. The FPI alone was highlighted as being responsible for 10 acts of violence in 2007, he said, adding that the FPI and FBR were responsible for eight incidents of violence in 2008. The three groups perpetrated 40 acts of violence in 2009. So far this year, all 49 incidents of violence have been attributed to the FPI. Bambang reiterated that these organizations had to be frozen or outlawed, but at the same time admitted it would be difficult to do so. He argued that the option to disband mass organizations was not stipulated in the 1985 Mass Organization Law. The law needed to be revised, he said. However, a copy of the law obtained by The Jakarta Post clearly stipulates in Clause 13 that “the government can freeze a mass organization if it obstructs public safety and security, accepts donations from foreign institutions without the consent of the government, or donates to foreign institutions that can endanger the state and the nation”. In Clause 14, the law states that should the frozen organization continue to carry out violations, the government was allowed to permanently disband it. Gamawan said the number of mass organizations in the country had increased significantly, making it difficult for his ministry to monitor all of them. “In 2005, there were only around 3,000 registered organizations. In 2010, there were around 9,000 organizations at the central level,” he said. Gamawan added that there could be more unregistered mass organizations because the current law did not stipulate sanctions for mass organizations that were not listed. He agreed that the law needed to be revised and that his ministry was formulating a draft on a revision that would be submitted to the House by October this year. All talk: National Police chief Gen.

"Sat, September 4 2010",Letter: Did they lose their faith?,"I feel sorry that many Muslims in Indonesia have lost faith in theirreligion. This seems to include the religious affairs minister(“Ahmadiyah must be disbanded: Minister”, Aug. 30). He and organizationslike the FPI do not believe that Islam is a strong and attractivereligion. In the mid-seventh century into the middle of the eighth century, Islamspread from Mecca and Medina to cover half of the world. During thistime, as the Arabs conquered an area they did not force the populationto change religion. They protected the churches and temples of theconquered nations and allowed the people to worship as they pleased. They did this because they had great faith. Their belief was Islam andthe power of the religion and the Koran would overcome other religionspeacefully. They had faith — they believed. People like the minister and organizations like FPI are people who donot believe Islam is an attractive religion. They believe no one willbecome a Muslim without coercion or force. They are bad, unbelievingMuslims. They are also wrong. I am not a Muslim but I believe that real believers will have the strongfaith that allows others to worship as they feel. They are not afraid,as are the FPI, that Islam is weak and unattractive. They believe inIslam. Real Muslims will allow neither the FPI nor the religious affairsminister to besmirch their religion by persecuting others. In thisinstance, the minister wishes to punish the victims of violence and toreward the perpetrators of violence and unlawful actions. He is bothfaithless and cowardly to take this action.

"Wed, September 8 2010",Cafes keep their heads down to respect Muslims,"Many Jakarta cafes and restaurants remain open (and some even serve beer) during the fasting month, but they try to operate discreetly in respect of Muslims and in fear of raids by hard-line groups. A bar and restaurant on Jl. Wahid Hasyim, Central Jakarta, serves beer but keeps the bottles out of sight. When a customer orders a large bottle of beer, he or she is served the drink in two mugs. “We do this to prevent hard-line protests,” waiter Deden said. “I know it’s ridiculous, because the mugs have beer brands stamped on them anyway. But it is better to serve beer in mugs during Ramadan because as long as no beer bottles are around, we are safe,” he said. “We don’t want the FPI [Islam Defenders Front] to attack us,” he told The Jakarta Post, referring to a hard-line group infamous for its violent raids on nightclubs during the fasting month. Deden added that the cafe also closed earlier, normally between midnight and 1 a.m., instead of 3 a.m. Showing a similar gesture, KL Village, a cafe on Jl. Jaksa, Central Jakarta, puts shades on its windows and surrounding its open area. “My boss told me that we have to put shades on the restaurant during Ramadan because its required by the city administration,” waitress Putri said. The 2004 City Bylaws on Tourism prohibits nightclubs, bars and massage parlors from operating during Ramadan. The rules refer to bars as places which serve alcoholic beverages. The 2004 gubernatorial decree regulates the operating hours of night time entertainment centers such as karaoke halls during Ramadan. Dian Aryanti, whose office is located in the Skyline building in Central Jakarta, said that she appreciated that many cafes in the area put up shades to respect Muslims. “I appreciate that they respect those that are fasting. However, many other places, such as cafes at the Grand Indonesia in Central Jakarta and Senayan City in South Jakarta do not put up shades, and I’m OK with it,” she said. “It depends on each person’s faith. We are all grown ups. Actually, we don’t need discreetness like that,” she added. Tito Triputra, a regular patron of cafes and bars along Jl. Jaksa, said that as the majority, religious respect should begin with Muslims themselves. “Shades or no shades, it doesn’t matter. These cafes never intend to disrespect Muslims,” he said, adding that the city bylaw on restaurants, cafes and entertainment centers during Ramadan was unclear.

"Wed, September 15 2010","View point: Symbolic acts, real consequences","Ah, Ramadan’s over for another year, and on Sept. 10 and 11 we celebrated Idul Fitri (Eid) with much rejoicing and overeating, to say nothing of the noisy fireworks in the small park on my street. Ramadan is, of course, when Muslims engage in a month of sawm, Arabic for “to abstain”. For most, that just means no eating, drinking or sex from sunrise to sundown, although observance of sawm is also meant to train us to control our emotions, to engage in introspection, to be compassionate, charitable, tolerant, and to share with the less fortunate. One Islamic website adds that sawm should include avoiding acts of stupidity.  Now there’s a good idea! Perhaps if the Indonesia Ulema Council (MUI) weren’t so good at being guilty of it themselves, they would have issued a fatwa about it by now. It’s a pity they haven’t. It might have stopped the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) doing something in August that was both intolerant and stupid enough to be a serious sawm-stopper. Fast or no fast, FPI tried to hunt down Erwin Arnada, former editor-in-chief of (now-defunct) Indonesian Playboy magazine. Arnada had been put on trial for indecency and acquitted three years ago, but the Supreme Court recently reversed that decision and sentenced him to two years in prison, even though Playboy Indonesia famously (and disappointingly for some) contained no nudity. Before prosecutors even received the documents on the ruling, the FPI were after Arnada. You’re barking up the wrong tree, boys, Playboy Indonesia doesn’t even exist anymore! Why all the fuss about poor old “no boobs” Erwin when the country is awash with local magazines packed with much more hardcore stuff? Because the magazine symbolizes Western cultural imperialism, that’s why. The whole brouhaha was never really about pornography, just that name! Such is the power of symbols. As another example, take this year’s commemoration of the ninth anniversary of 9/11, which coincidentally fell on the second day of Eid. Terry Jones was a pastor from Florida whom no one had heard of until he put up a banner advertising his bright idea of turning Sept. 11 into “International Burn a Koran Day”. Pastor Jones and his tiny congregation of 50 didn’t really represent anyone but themselves, but the story quickly spread around the world. On Sept. 4, an Islamist group demonstrated in front of the US Embassy in Jakarta, and on Sept. 6, several hundred demonstrators protested in Kabul, with stones thrown at US Army vehicles. It’s scary: a misguided, attention-seeking nobody with a bad moustache had provoked demonstrations against the US in Muslim-majority countries, and its armed forces around the world were on high alert. Things began to spin out of control so badly that President Barack Obama had to state publicly that burning the Koran would be a dumb thing to do. Duh. Unfortunately, our leaders aren’t as sensible or principled as America’s leadership (on this occasion at least). President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) is famous for being a wimp on religious freedom, while Suryadharma Ali, the Religious Affairs Minister, is as bad as the FPI. After all, he’s the one who disturbed Ramadan with calls to ban the Ahmadiyah sect outright, which was like giving the FPI a license to kill. Perhaps he and Pastor Jones should get together and compare notes — preferably on a remote desert island? Fortunately, there are still some people who are prepared to engage in symbolic acts that aim to unite, not divide. Take Feisal Abdul Rauf, the imam behind the so-called “Ground Zero mosque” (actually the Cordoba Community Center). He is described by colleagues as “scholarly, quiet, serious, tireless, tolerant, open, gentle and dignified”. Deeply committed to the tenets of Islam that call for compassion, mercy and service, Imam Feisal is a bridge builder seeking to unite all faiths, although he’s has never been adverse to entering the fray when necessary, including criticizing fellow Muslims for travesties against Islam like the burning of churches in Malaysia. In response to the protests against the “Ground Zero mosque” for being “insensitive to the victims of 9/11”, Imam Feisal points out that it’s actually not a mosque (there’s already a mosque much closer to the Ground Zero area). Instead, he is proposing an interfaith center, with prayer spaces for Christians and Jews as well as Muslims. It’s also not even at Ground Zero, but ten blocks away. Finally, he reminds anyone willing to listen that 60 innocent Muslims were among those killed in the 9/11 attacks. However logical his explanations, the building of the Cordoba Community Centre remains a Catch-22 for Imam Feisal. If he goes ahead, he will be damned by the more than 70 percent of non-Muslim Americans who oppose it. If he doesn’t, he’ll be damned by Muslim hard-liners worldwide. Backing down and moving to another location would send the message that Islam is under attack and, as he says, that “will strengthen the argument of the radicals to recruit … and their increasing aggression and violence against [the US]”.  So — ironically — it’s not just the rights of Muslims he’s defending, but also US national security, and ultimately, peace for everyone. Yes, symbolic acts are very powerful, even more so negative ones. So whose example do our own leaders want to follow? Imam Feisal or Pastor Jones? Sadly, it seems very much like the latter.

"Thu, September 16 2010",Mayor says embattled church should move,"Bekasi authorities said Wednesday that the recently attacked HKBP Christian church should move for safety reasons, despite the group’s claim of a constitutional right of freedom of worship. Separately the police said they arrested a 10th suspect on Wednesday in the attack of two HKBP Pondok Timur Indah church leaders on Sunday. The new suspect was the head of the Bekasi branch of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), said police. Police previously said that none of the suspects in the attack, which sent a church elder and a priest to hospital, were connected to mass organizations. The FPI denied involvement in the incident. HKBP members said that the  congregation would not move, citing an agreement made on July 9 with local authorities that stipulated that  members could continue to worship at HKBP’s church construction site in Ciketing, Mustika Jaya district. The arrest came a day after President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono issued a stern warning that the case should be settled thoroughly. “There can be no place for violence ... more so when it comes to interfaith relations,” Yudhoyono said. Yudhoyono ordered local authorities to find “a wise solution” to the tensions in the largely Muslim community. Bekasi Mayor Mochtar Muhammad said officials met with Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Timur Pradopo and West Java Governor Ahmad Heryawan. After the meeting, the administration offered the congregation two sites in the city for their religious services, he said. Mochtar said that the first site was a 2,500-square-meter lot owned by the administration. The second site is a 2,000-square meter lot on Jl. Chairil Anwar. owned by a private company that the administration will buy for the church if it wants to move, he said. “We will provide the church with a building for temporary use while their new church is built. We will guarantee their safety,” he said. The governor said that residents did not lack freedom to worship. “We want to offer the best solution to everyone by giving the church these two locations,” he said. Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Boy Rafli Amar said that the latest suspect in the attack, Murharli Barda, allegedly provoked the other nine suspect to attack the church leaders. “He was not far from the crime scene when the incident happened,” Boy said. Murharli is from Babelan, near Bekasi, while the other suspects range from 17 to 29 years of age and come from places outside Ciketing, such as the industrial areas of Bantar Gebang and Cikarang, he said. Church elder Hasian Lumbantoruan Sihombing, who was stabbed in the stomach in the attack, was no longer in critical condition, according to reports. The priest who was hit on the head with a plank,  Rev. Luspida Simandjuntak, is also improving, HKBP members said. Jeirry Sumampow from the Indonesian Communion of Churches (PGI) said moving the church would not solve the problem. Another HKBP church in Jatimulya, East Bekasi, experienced intimidation from hard-line groups and was told to move to a place provided for free by the administration about five years ago. “They are still receiving threats from hard-line groups,” he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/09/16/mayor-says-embattled-church-should-move.html,,2010
"Thu, September 16 2010",Text your say: Attack on HKBP leaders,"Your comments on President Yudhoyono’s call to President Obama tostop the planned Koran burning and what the Indonesian President shoulddo about the attack on the two leaders of the HKBP Church in Bekasi,West Java. Why must the President be involved in every little thing? Where are the ministers? Is it one-man show? What is the Cabinet for? Iskendar New York Mr. President, you are our father. This is another case in which you talk too much. We need you and the Cabinet members to do more and talk less. Please, even temporarily, cut out the boring speeches. We are tired of listening to your complaints. Mardjan Bekasi SBY has to be very careful. There’s a law that stipulates that any construction of a house of worship has to be supported by at least 60 local residents. In short, this law means that any religion group can build their house of worship if enough of the congregation (at least 60) is living in that area. The incident occurred because HKBP wanted to build their church in a heavily populated Muslim area without showing proof that they had enough of a congregation in that area. Can a mosque be built in the HKBP heartland, the Batak Karo area? Of course not, the HKBP would be furious if a mosque were built in their heartland. So why does the HKBP demand to build their church in an area where most of their members do not live? This incident already shows the political motive of the HKBP leadership. The HKBP, in my eyes, is not that much different than the FPI as a group that uses religion as a tool for their political ambitions. Ananda Jakarta Like the cigarette ad says, “Talk less, do more.” So how about it, Mr. President? Cah Cilacap, Central Java Will Obama ask SBY to stop the attack on minority and Christian group? Tony Wong Riau I think it would be a good idea if people who are not already familiar with it, took the time to read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

"Sat, September 18 2010","Who is more heartless, SBY or Terry Jones?","The planned Koran burning initiated by Florida Evangelist Church leader Terry Jones has been canceled. Previously, Jones and his followers had been planning to burn the holy book of Islam to commemorate the Sept. 11 tragedy. This “insane” plan stirred up massive reactions from Muslims around the globe, including the Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY). SBY sent an official letter to President Barack Obama requesting the Koran “BBQ” be canceled. SBY reminded Obama that the incident would affect world peace. In his letter, SBY aimed to point out that Indonesian Christians did not share Terry Jones’ sentiments. What a wise president. Not long after it was announced that the Koran-burning was canceled, an incident occurred in which two leaders of a Batak Protestant Church (HKBP) in Bekasi, West Java, Hasian Lumbantoruan Sihombing and Rev. Luspida Simanjuntak, were attacked by assailants. The police are still investigating the case. Unfortunately, Jakarta Police Chief Timur Pradopo hastily concluded that the case was a purely criminal act devoid of any religious sentiment. His statement was challenged by Indonesian Communion of Churches chairman Rev. Andreas A. Yewangoe, who deplored the police general’s statement. Andreas said Timur had arrived at the conclusion too hastily and before conducting a thorough investigation. A similar argument came from senior lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis, who said the stabbing of the HKBP priest was not an ordinary criminal act. The incident probably has the potential to threaten the freedom to worship. President SBY was extremely proactive when dealing with the Terry Jones threat, but how about the HKBP attacks and other similar violent cases carried out in the name of religion in Indonesia? Did SBY feel the same? The burning of the Koran cannot be justified in any way. This act would have indirectly hurt other communities, in this case: Muslims. The very same feeling was also experienced by followers of the Ahmadiyah sect and the HKBP congregation in Indonesia, who constantly face violence and intimidation from the communities around them. As a result, they have become traumatized. What the religious extremists did in Indonesia was very similar to what Terry Jones never got around to doing. Although Terry Jones only planned the burning of Koran, violent acts have happened so many times in Indonesia. According to Setara Institute, an NGO, in 2009 alone there were 200 cases of violations of freedom of faith comprising 291 incidents in Indonesia. Those were criminal acts that involved the state as a minor player. The followers of the Ahmadiyah sect have suffered the greatest number of violations of all religious groups in the country. It has on 33 occasions been the victim of religious violations, many of them violent — including the burning down of their place of worship and being denied the right to worship. The HKBP church in Bekasi has suffered similar treatment. These facts, along with the absence of a legal process, are evidence that the Indonesian government systematically allowed acts of religious violence to occur. The instigators of this violence, including the FPI (Islam Defenders Front) and other similar organizations are apparently protected by the government, while Terry Jones was heavily pressurized by President Barack Obama’s administration. One of the impositions affecting freedom of religion is the Religious Affairs Ministry’s and the Home Ministry’s Joint Decrees (SKB) No. 9/2006 and No. 8/2006 on the establishment of places of worship. This SKB has ignited violent and discriminative acts aimed at religious minorities looking to establish new places of worship. The decree makes it hard to obtain a permit to build a house of worship and has paved the way for the government and communities to blackmail minority groups. In addition, Ahmadiyah followers are discriminated against by three joint ministerial decrees about worshiping and proselytizing. Even incumbent Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali voiced his plan to dissolve Ahmadiyah after this year’s Idul Fitri holiday. Prominent Catholic figure Romo Franz Magniz-Suseno called Suryadharma’s statement a disgrace. Eva K. Sundari, a legislator, suggested the withdrawal of the SKBs on the establishment of places of worship and Ahmadiyah. Her suggestion constitutes the right thing to do for SBY’s government. Terry Jones’ hatred of Islam was reflected in his plan to burn the Koran, and Suryadharma Ali’s hatred of Ahmadiyah is reflected in his desire to dissolve the sect. It is ironic because President SBY promptly sent a letter to Obama about the Koran burning, but at home he appears to be ignorant of the violent acts that have happened so many times in his own backyard. The government does not seem to care about what has happened recently. If Terry Jones’ plan to burn the Koran was just an empty threat, and SBY’s sacrificing of the HKBP church in Bekasi and Ahmadiyah is done just to protect his regime, then SBY is more heartless than Terry Jones!

"Fri, September 24 2010",Letter: An open letter for FPI,"If it is proven that those who attacked the HKBP congregation and stabbed their pastor are members of the Islam Defender’s Front (FPI), there is no reason for the government not to ban the organization, like the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). It is very urgent. Why? Many devout Muslims in my area condemn every harsh action taken by the FPI. They say, “People like the FPI members practice syahadat only in words!” FPI clearly does not represent the real face of Islam, a religion of peace. I just worry that every time FPI brutally destroys and attacks a particular group of people or place, Islamophobia will spread much faster in Indonesia. Islam will be feared by all non-Muslims, and all Muslims will be labeled as a community of blood-sucking hyenas that  destroy everything and hate peace. I respect FPI members as human beings and I respect their spirit and humanity. What I condemn is their deeds that jeopardize our religion. Even Imam Hasan al-Banna, the founder of Ikhwanul Muslimin, whom I’m sure is highly respected by the FPI, once condemned the actions of ‘Misr al-Fatah Party members who destroyed a café and everything inside. Imam al-Banna denounced such brutal actions and approaches, but also reminded the government to look upon the objective substance that called on those people to commit such crimes. I know that the FPI wants to practice amar makruf nahi munkar (call on good deeds and prevent evil deeds). It is highly respected in Islam. So don’t be trapped in amar munkar li nahi munkar.

"Wed, September 29 2010",FPI disrupts gay film festival,"Members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) staged rallies at foreign cultural centers on Tuesday, demanding the termination of the 9th Q! Film Festival, which showcased LGBT artwork. The group demanded the cultural centers close down the festival within 24 hours. In a rally in front of the Goethe Institute German cultural center in Menteng, Central Jakarta, at around 11:45 a.m., a protestor from the FPI said the group would burn down the venue if it continued to showcase movies about gay and lesbians. Dressed in traditional white Muslim attire and waving posters showing screenshots of the  movies featured in the festival, the protesters verbally abused homosexuality. FPI Jakarta deputy chairman Fachry Idrus Jamalullail said the group would reject any events related to lesbian or gay issues because “it is against the principles of Islam”, and claimed their actions represented all Muslims in the country. Fachry would not be drawn into discussing what the group might do if the festival persisted, saying they would just wait and see. The FPI also rallied in front of the Erasmus Huis Dutch cultural center, the Center Culturel Francais Jakarta and the Japan Foundation. The rallies caused the festival’s organizer to cancel several movie screenings in the afternoon but several screenings were held in the evening. The annual film festival that ends Thursday also features art from various countries focusing on human rights and HIV/AIDS issues. The festival is also being held at several galleries and theaters. Festival cofounder and director John Badalu said he and his team were committed to running the festival according to schedule. “We’re still going to go on,” he said. He said there had been venue changes, adding that the Cemara 6 gallery in Central Jakarta and the Apollo bar in South Jakarta would not host any more events. “The Japan foundation has not decided yet. They stopped today and won’t do it tomorrow. But we don’t know after that,” he said. John said the FPI had protested the festival in its first years, but not in recent years. John said intense media coverage of the event might have triggered this year’s protests. “This year we decided to talk to AFP, which ran a story under the heading ‘Gay Film Festival Opens in Muslim Majority Indonesia’ and Republika [newspaper daily] picked that story up,” he said. John said the festival aimed to celebrate diversity and was meant to allow people to learn to appreciate human beings for who they were. Movie theater Kineforum program manager Lisabona Rahman said the film festival had continued at Kineforum despite FPI protests because the program was important from a human rights and human identity standpoint. “We are proud to partner with the [festival] organizers.” Commenting on the protests, the Jakarta administration said it was hard to stop the FPI’s violent protests and raids. “We have often tried to communicate with them, but they still don’t change,” said Arfan Arkili, head of the administration’s National Unity Board, which oversees mass organizations in the city. Governor Fauzi Bowo was not available for comment because he is in Rotterdam, and Deputy Governor Prijanto refused to comment about the protests. Hesty Armywulan from the National Commission for Human Rights said as long as the FPI did not resort to violence their actions were acceptable, “but when they start to intimidate that can be considered a violation [of human rights]”. Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Boy Rafli Amar said the police would only take action if they received reports from residents.

"Thu, September 30 2010",Fear of PKI leads to banning books,"Indonesia observes the anniversary of the death of seven generals in the 1965 abortive coup, that led to a pogrom against hundreds of thousands of alleged members of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). Forty-five years on, fears of communism linger on in the Attorney General’s Office (AGO), still unwilling to revoke laws allowing the government to ban books on Marxism. The AGO in 2009 banned books, including John Roosa’s take on the coup, entitled Dalih Pembunuhan Massal Gerakan 30 September dan Kudeta Soeharto (Pretext for Mass Murder The September 30 Movement and Soehartos Coup d’ Etat). The AGO claimed the book might “disrupt public order” allegedly containing “false information”. An AGO official was reported to have said the book was provocative against the Constitution and Pancasila, and communist propaganda. The AGO also prohibited the distribution of Lekra Tak Pernah Membakar Buku, Suara Senyap Lembar Kebudayaan Harian Rakjat 1950-1965 (Lekra Never Burns Books, Harian Rakjats Cultural Pages Silent Voice) by Rhoma Dwi Aria Yuliantri and Muhidin M. Dahlan. Books on faith and spirituality were also banned on the grounds that they could spread heretical teaching and cause confusion. The AGO confiscated dozens of history textbooks, particularly those highlighting the Sept. 30 movement, citing fears they could lead to a resurgence of communism. A historian from the University of Indonesia, Asvi Warman Adam, told The Jakarta Post on Wednesday that Roosa’s book offers a new perspective on the history behind the 1965 incident to the public. “Book banning is no longer a relevant practice today. It is a product of the Sukarno’s regime, which survived the new order regime,” he said. He added that after the fall of Soeharto’s New Order in 1998, the AGO actually stopped banning books, but started to do so again about 2006. “There was no book banning through the era president Habibie, Abdurrahman Wahid or Megawati. It was only picked up during President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s administration,” he said. He urged Yudhoyono to “take responsibility” and put an end to this. Under Article 30 (3) of the 2004 AGO law, the AGO has the authority to control the circulation of printed material to maintain public order. This authority is being contested by an author whose book was among those banned in February who requested the Constitutional Court to review the article. The court has yet to decide on the matter. Asvi said fear of communism is still prevalent among some people. “But what is more visible is that there are attempts made by certain groups to keep the threat of communism alive. They reap benefits by doing so. But this is irrelevant. What danger can it possibly be? Their members are now 80 years old. Just because they believed in communism, does not mean their children would have the same ideology,” he added. Indonesia witnessed in June that the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) raided and broke up a meeting in a restaurant in Banyuwangi involving members of the House of Representatives committee overseeing health affairs. The FPI accused the legislators of holding a reunion for former members of the PKI.

Around 50 students from the UI’s various dakwah (preaching) organizations staged a protest in front of the Goethe Institute German cultural center on Jl. Sam Ratulangi, Central Jakarta, demanding an end to the 9th Q! Film Festival. “The screenings of the movies have violated the rights of Indonesians, who are  Muslim in the majority, because the movies are loaded with violations of moral and religious values,” said protester Nur Fahmi, a student of UI’s School of Law, as quoted by tempointeraktif.com. Nur said the screenings violated the 2008 Pornography Law and article 28 of the Constitution about tolerance and democracy. The organizers of the festival, which runs from Sep. 24 to Oct. 3, went ahead with the event despite the protests, but canceled screenings at several locations, including the Cemara 6 gallery, the Japan Foundation and Kineforum in Central Jakarta and Apollo Bar in South Jakarta. Festival co-founder and director John Badalu said in a text message to The Jakarta Post that the organizers had to cancel all screenings at Kineforum on Wednesday for security reasons, and because there were not enough volunteers to preside over the screenings. The festival went ahead at several foreign cultural centers, including the CCF French cultural center, the Erasmus Huis Dutch cultural center and the Goethe Institute. In its official statement published on its website www.q-munity.org, the Q-Munity Foundation for Equality in Indonesia, which organizes the film festival along with various organizations and cultural centers, said it intended to continue with the event as scheduled. National Commission for Human Rights commissioner Nur Kholis said the festival organizers and the FPI had the same right to express their stance on any issue. “Unfortunately, there was suspicion that the protest by one party [the FPI] was intimidating the other [the organizers]. Since this problem relates to values there should be a long dialogue between the two parties to bridge their difference. “The initiative should come from the government. Don’t let this conflict be drawn out because it concerns the freedom of expression,” Nur said.

"Sat, October 2 2010",FPI reports festival organizer to police,"The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) reported the Q-Munity Foundation for Equality in Indonesia (Q-Munity) to police on Friday for allegedly screening pornography. The organizer has breached the information and electronic transaction law and the anti-pornography law, FPI advocacy unit chief Munarman said. “The Q! Film Festival broadcasts pornographic content in the form of unnatural sexual intercourse and same-sex relationships,” he said. FPI staged rallies on Wednesday at foreign cultural centers where the movies have been played, demanding the termination of the festival within 24 hours. The festival, which runs in Jakarta until Sunday, has continued despite the protests, but has canceled screenings and events at several locations, including the Cemara 6 gallery, the Japan Foundation and Kineforum in Central Jakarta and Apollo Bar in South Jakarta. The festival will also be held in Surabaya, Malang, Bali, Yogyakarta and Makassar until mid-October. “Q-munity has violated the information law by distributing the movies. They also violate the pornography law by broadcasting imported porn,” Munarman said. Munarman and Jakarta branch FPI chairman Habib Salim Alatas gave the police movie CDs as evidence. “Homosexuality is a crime against decency and morality, also a crime against religion,” Munarman said. Homosexuality should not be celebrated in a festival but “cured” because it is a “mental illness”. Habib Salim bin Umar Al Athos said FPI would bring the case to court. “People say the FPI are instigators that threaten society. Here’s the proof, we are reporting violation of the pornography law.” The FPI had protested the festival during its first years but had not showed significant opposition before this year. The annual film festival has run since 2001, screening LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans-gender) movies and holding art exhibitions and discussions concerning human rights issues. The Q-Munity website stated that the festival achieved international recognition by becoming part of the Berlin Film Festival. LGBT communities are minorities that need to be protected because they have the same rights to express their opinions and to assemble in an organization, National Commission for Human Rights advocate Ridha Saleh said. “The problem is not the film festival. It’s their right to express their opinions and to gather in an organization. These communities gathered to express their feelings, not to commit treason. Therefore the police have to protect them in an objective manner,” he said. Ridha emphasized that the movies were tools to empower the LGBT communities by informing the public about their lives and their problems. “They have no intention to encourage others to become gay or lesbian. The festival is a tool to communicate and share their experiences.” The festival could also better inform the public and improve awareness on HIV/AIDS. The Health Ministry reported a spike in HIV/AIDS cases, from 2,684 in 2004 to 21,770 in June 2010. About 49.3 percent of the cases were caused by heterosexual intercourse, while another 40.4 percent were caused by needle exchanges among narcotics users, Ridha said.

"Sun, October 3 2010",By the way ... A solution to traffic jams; MUI prohibition of cars,"Traffic jams are expected to vanish throughout Indonesia once a new edict by a leading agency takes effect. The surprise fatwa from the MUI (Motorcyclists’ Union of Indonesia) was announced just before mudik, the annual pilgrimage to hometowns and parents undertaken by many Indonesians at the end of the slowing month. MUI secretary Bangbang Twostroke said the fatwa prohibited the use of cars, which were now haram. Although it was difficult to impose a fatwa on those groups that didn’t follow MUI’s teachings, it was expected that most would accept the ruling to avoid drawing attention to themselves and creating unnecessary conflict. The roads would be far less congested once the fatwa was in place and all four-wheel vehicles were either locked up or deported. He added that two-wheel transport goes back centuries so reverting to the past would create a purer nation. “You can’t hide on a motorbike,” Bangbang said. “Everyone can see what you’re up to. Behind the tinted windows of cars all sorts of immorality can take place. “The MUI has long been concerned about the rise in popularity of other means of transport. “We’ve had to accept the government’s five-brand policy, but there have been issues in some regions that have disturbed local communities. “Allegations have been made of moves to Toyotarize Indonesians.  I’ve even heard of preman [thugs] with Manado accents trying to Nissanize locals with promises of high trade-ins and cashbacks. “The Mercedes trinity star is known to have other meanings. Those of us who believe in only one brand find the symbol offensive.” The police have been instructed not to tolerate attempted conversions from two to four wheels by outside forces with other agendas. FPI (Friendly People of Indonesia) squads were ready to assist the police and ensure the fatwa was obeyed. Mr. Bangbang rejected reports that FPI members had already started trashing cars as “baseless accusations from dark forces planning to overthrow the Unitary State”. A spokesman for the Ministry of Agama (Automobile, Gasoline and Mechanical Appliances) said no comment would be made on the MUI’s fatwa, though the minister welcomed any moves to restrict the number of road users, particularly those who didn’t follow the number one brand. “In the past we’ve been tolerant of deviants like Suzuki and Yamaha, but it’s now time to disband them,” he said. “The minister realizes this is a controversial move. It may be in breach of the Constitution, which allows citizens freedom to ride the brand of their choice. But no matter. Our founding fathers did not appreciate the threats now coming from outside. Public order must be maintained.” During the slowing month, when petrol tanks may only be filled between dusk and dawn, reports of surly young men in gangs hanging around food stalls at nightfall astride motorcycles have been causing concern among supporters of cars. Last month it was claimed motorcycle numbers in Indonesia would double by 2015.  Last year 6.5 million pedestrians converted to motorbikes, the majority choosing to follow Honda. For every car that rolls onto the road, five motorbikes take to the streets. Mr. Bangbang said it was clear the infrastructure could not cope.  There just wasn’t enough room on public roads, so some users have to go. It was right and proper that those evicted from the highways should be the rich driving foreign cars and taking up too much space. If action wasn’t taken now Jakarta could suffer a stroke as its traffic arteries became clogged by the cholesterol of unconstrained private transport. “The reality is that this is a Honda nation,” he said.  “Those who want to follow other forms of transport should move to North Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara or Bali where different brands are tolerated. “However the transmigration of motorbikes from the overcrowded roads of Java to the quiet tracks of Central Kalimantan and elsewhere will continue.  This means that the majorities in those regions may soon become the minorities. “The alternative if for dissidents to embrace two-wheels with fervor if they want to remain citizens.  This is a move that can only enhance democracy by ensuring that all Indonesians follow only one way.” — Duncan Graham",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/10/03/by-way-a-solution-traffic-jams-mui-prohibition-cars.html,,2010
"Wed, October 6 2010","Pinar Ilkkaracan : All of her sexualities, all of her Islams","Once upon a time there were two Muslims, one from Indonesia, the other from Turkey. Yes, they share a religion, but there’s scarcely any connection between the two in terms of how their faith affects their attitude to life. Courtesy of Pinar Ilkkaracan The one from Indonesia is Tifatul Sembiring,   minister of what should be called the (Mis)communication and (Mis)information  Department in the Second (Dis)United Indonesian Cabinet. Yes, Tifatul is notorious for his odious statements and tweets, the most recent ones in reaction to the Q! Film Festival (http://www.q-munity.org). He targeted gays with a series of homophobic tweets blaming “perverted sex acts” for the spread of HIV/AIDS, quoted a passage from the Koran about God “smiting with rocks from a burning land”, and broke down the acronym AIDS as “Akibat Itunya Dipakai Sembarangan” (what you get for sticking your penis into just about everything). Titaful’s tweets would be insulting, offensive and deeply inappropriate coming from anyone, but being a Cabinet minister only makes this embarrassingly flagrant display of bigotry and ignorance worse. Now, compare our pathetic minister with that other Muslim I mentioned, Pinar Ilkkaracan. She is a researcher, activist, trainer, psychotherapist — one of Turkey’s leading feminists — and her mission in life is to do the exact opposite of people like Tifatul wherever possible. Pinar was the executive director of Women for Women’s Human Rights (WWHR)-New Ways for twelve years (1994-2006), an organization she founded in 1993. WWHR engages in advocacy and lobbying for women’s human rights at the national, regional and international levels, conducts training programs, and coordinates an international program to promote sexual and bodily rights as human rights in Muslim societies. For almost two decades Pinar has worked tirelessly to dispel prejudices and promote understanding about the centrality of human sexuality and the difference it can make in people’s lives. In her country, the campaign led by Pinar’s organization brought about the reform of the Turkish Penal Code in 2004, which included 30 amendments that constituted a major step to the protection of women’s human rights. Internationally Pinar is also very active in UN forums. She recalls being involved in a milestone event when as a result of immense pressure from thousands of women and women’s groups, the UN finally recognized that women and girls have human rights — only in 1993! Pinar was recently in Jakarta in her capacity as one of the international coordinators of the Coalition for Sexual and Bodily Rights (CSBR) in Muslim Societies  (see my column “Divided by Culture, United by Religion and… Sex”, in TJP, Sept. 29 2010). This was not the first time she’s conducted an event in Indonesia. She says she loves it here because she was inspired by what she saw then as the tolerance for sexual diversities. That’s why in 2004 Pinar organized the first South and Southeast Asian Conference on Sexuality and Human Rights in Muslim Societies here in Jakarta (http://www.wwhr.org/files/jakarta.pdf), in collaboration with the Indonesian Women’s Health Foundation (http://ykesehatanperempuan.org/). WWHR gathered 25 NGO representatives and researchers from Muslim societies in Jakarta, to discuss key issues on sexual and bodily rights, sexual politics and human rights. If Tifatul invokes the Koran to justify hatred, Pinar’s press statement at the 2004 conference invoked it in the name of an all-embracing love. It emphasized that “social justice and the dignity of women and men are enshrined in the Koran” and that sexual oppression was not Islamic but, like so many things, a result of political, social and economic inequalities. Despite the taboo on sex in many Muslim societies, many scholars have argued that the Koran itself discusses these things openly, and in great detail. Pinar has certainly picked up on this and is one of an increasing number of Muslim scholars who reinterpret texts to allow for a wider spectrum of sexual relationships, including homosexuality. In Islam, she says, sex is pretty cool — in fact, it’s obligatory within marriage. Why did Pinar chose Indonesia again, given increasing violent protests and demonstrations against a number of LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bi-Sexual, Transgender) events this year by Muslim hard-liners like FPI (Islam Defenders Front)? She said that’s precisely why she felt it was important to hold the event in Indonesia: to counter the bigotry of the thugs who call themselves Muslims. Not just Tifatul, but also the likes of Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) who also gave the thumbs down on the Q! Film Fest. So which one of the two Muslim leaders do you think takes the inner message of their religion seriously? Tifatul the turkey or Pinar from Turkey? The answer wouldn’t surprise anyone except of course, Titaful and that man in the palace who thought he was Ministerial material! Wrong again, Pak Beye!",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/10/06/pinar-ilkkaracan-all-her-sexualities-all-her-islams.html,,2010

"Thu, October 7 2010","The tipping point, terrorism and crimes against humanity","It’s mind-boggling that the National Police have claimed they are one of the best police forces in the world in tackling terrorism and that the government has claimed it is an administration that governs a pluralistic country. Their claims are far from factual conditions. Otherwise many people wouldn’t be puzzled. The Islam Defenders Front’s (FPI) acts of terror are rampant and have reached a point where religious minorities, including both non-Muslims and Muslims, have no place to stand and breathe. Recently, the places of worship and private residences of the Ahmadiyah Muslim sect have been ransacked, destroyed and burned. People have been abused physically, mentally, and emotionally. Nothing the FPI does projects an image of peace, which is what Islam stands for. The FPI are more than religious extremists. And the Indonesian government has not acted properly to ensure they no longer perform acts of terrorism in the future. The government must ensure that future acts of terrorism are eliminated, including those that may be perpetrated by the FPI on any civilian and any minority group. Only in this way could the country be called an integrated and pluralistic nation. Today, Indonesia is merely a segregated pluralistic country, or in other words, it looks pluralistic on the surface only. To this day, a joint ministerial decree issued in 2008 banning Ahmadiyah members from practicing their faith in public or spreading its beliefs is still in force. In 2005, the MUI (Indonesian Ulemas Council) also issued an edict that said Ahmadiyah was heterical and blamesphemous. Let me humbly remind the government that it allegedly “condoned” those brutal acts legally (through the joint decree) and morally (through the MUI’s edict). It might be true that President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono previously expressed his sympathy to victims and asked the police to maintain security. However, by upholding the joint ministerial decree, the government became the perpetrator of so-called “legalized persecution.” It violated the 1945 Constitution (the right to worship), principles of democracy (the protection of minorities) and principles of human rights. Of course, the government has not signed the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Otherwise, Indonesia would have to ratify and enforce the statute. Upon enforcement, crimes against humanity could be brought to ICC in the Netherlands. The Rome Statue defines crimes against humanity as offenses that constitute a serious attack on human dignity or cause grave humiliation to one or more human beings. Crimes against humanity are not isolated or sporadic events, but are part of a government policy (although the perpetrators need not identify themselves with this policy) or are part of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a de facto authority. Murder, extermination, torture, rape, political, racial, or religious persecution and other inhumane acts may reach the threshold of crimes against humanity only if they are part of a widespread or systematic practice. Let me underscore this phrase: the wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a de facto authority. Not performing sufficient measures to prevent attacks by the FPI falls under this definition. At this point, we need to keep pressuring the government and Yudhoyono to use their consciences, maintain security and respect the Indonesian people’s sense of justice. International human rights watchdog organizations are working hard to pressure the government. And we, the people, are now waiting anxiously for a tipping point. The “tipping point” is a theory popularized by Malcolm Gladwell, which refers to the moment of critical mass, threshold or a boiling point. Certain individuals or situations may trigger the boiling point for sociological change. Considering the current state of frustration with and distrust of government by concerned citizens, it is not an exaggeration to predict that a tipping point for Indonesia is near. Such an occurrence might manifest itself in various forms, among which include the possibility of a revolution. A revolution itself is a fundamental change in power that takes place in a short period of time. How and when it will take place is a big question mark. It is simply a historical fact that change occurs periodically. Indonesia has endured far too long and is ripe for a major change where every citizen is equally protected. Things are boiling now and the tipping point is near.

"Sat, October 9 2010",Rights advocates turn to House to block top cop nominee,"Human rights activists continued to protest on Friday the nomination of Comr. Gen. Timur Pradopo to be the next National Police chief, saying they would lobby the House of Representatives to reject Timur. The House has scheduled a “fit and proper test” for Timur next week, after he was named the sole candidate for the job by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Monday. Top politicians from several parties including Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, the Golkar Party, the United Development Party and the Prosperous Justice Party have not objected to Timur’s nomination. Others, however, protested the move. Activists from several leading human rights NGOs vowed to intensify their lobbying of legislators to block Timur’s appointment. According to activists, Timur was unlikely to uphold human rights. Three human rights-related incidents continue to dog Timur’s nomination. First, Timur was West Jakarta Police chief in 1998 during the Trisakti shooting, in which four students were killed. Second, he was Central Jakarta Police chief in 1999 during the Semanggi incident, when another student was killed. Third, Timur declined to answer a summons in 2003 from the National Commission for Human Rights to answer questions about his role in the Trisakti incident. Al Araf, program director of Imparsial, an NGO focusing on human rights, said a series of meetings between activists and legislators had been scheduled to discuss the possibility of rejecting the President’s nominee. “Ever since the Trisakti shootings, Timur has proven that he doesn’t care about human rights,” he said. Araf said the NGOs has a list of potentially sympathetic legislators. “We must be very serious in showing them how dangerous it would be to approve Timur,” he said. Another Imparsial activist, Poengky Indarty, said that if the lobbying effort failed, activists would file a lawsuit with the State Administrative Court. “We must bring these complaints regarding Timur’s performance as police officer before the court and make them see that he is problematic and that is why we need to appoint another officer with cleaner background,” she said. Activists from the Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence (Kontras) previously protested Timur’s nomination, casting doubt on his ability to curb vigilante violence by groups such as the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). As Jakarta Police chief, Timur said that he would embrace the FPI to ensure security in the capital. Kontras representative Usman Hamid said Timur’s decision to embrace hard-liners had obviously violated the policy of current National Police chief Gen. Bambang Hendarso Danuri, who recommended that the government take a strong stance against violent mass organizations.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/10/09/rights-advocates-turn-house-block-top-cop-nominee.html,,2010
"Tue, October 12 2010",Comment: Freedom of association,"Oct. 6, p. 7: There have been numerous calls for the disbandment of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) recently.  Despite many allegations of crimes conducted by this mass organization,from an institutional aspect it appears that the human rights law ismarred by a paradox of tolerance and inherent intolerance. On the onehand, the law acknowledges the right and freedom to  create an association and on the other hand, there are also possible inhibitions imposed by the government on this freedom. This article attempts to scrutinize some legal justifications ininternational human rights law on how the government could conductlegitimate interferences on the freedom of association.  (By HarisonCitrawan, Jakarta) Your comments: It is really simple, you have the freedom of association, but as anassociation, you are bound by the law and the Constitution and you donot have the freedom to take actions that violates those laws. Simply put, the FPI certainly has the freedom to form theirorganization. The problem is their actions, unless I am mistaken,stoning people, stabbing people, running around like police when theyhave no authority is not sanctioned by Indonesian law and theConstitution. Just like in any democratic society, freedom offered to its citizensdoesn’t include freedom for its citizens to commit crime and otherconstitutional violations. This is a simple concept that a fifth gradershould understand.

"Fri, October 15 2010",The right to build mosques and churches,"Mosques and churches, in which believers pray to God for a happy life in this world and salvation in the world to come, can also cause tension and conflict. In this archipelagic country — with a boast-worthy diversity of ethnicities, faiths, ideologies, political parties and social organizations — mosques and churches of minority groups are under attack. Ahmadiyah’s mosques and the churches of the Batak Protestant Church (HKBP) in Bekasi are cases in point. Ironically, those who attacked those places of worship, such as the FPI (Islam Defenders Front), also pompously voiced their disagreement in public statements. They question the rights of minorities to build places of worship that they perceive as a threat to their mosques. Worse still, the government, e.g., the religious affairs minister, makes that disagreement its main concern and shields the mosques of the majority — which are in fact “safe and sound” as nobody dares to disturb them. The mosques and churches belonging to minority groups are then further discredited, while some of the perpetrators are roaming free and looking for vulnerable people who can be turned into radicals. Through the public media, schools and mosques, the younger generation can become the prey of radicals. True, some, such as Abu Bakar Ba’asyir and those who stabbed the HKBP leaders, were jailed for their roles in spreading hate, causing disorder and breaking the law. However, their ideologies are far from diminishing in this country. Nevertheless, you may wonder why the “majority” is so scared of the “minority”. Common sense and logic are turned upside down. Who is intimidating whom? Who are the perpetrators and who are the victims? The minority or the majority? Which one is increasing? Mosques or churches? Ahmadiyah’s mosques or the Muslim majority’s mosques? Throughout history, the diversity of this country has been palpable. Evidence can be seen in the remaining sanctuaries in Indonesia, Hindu and Buddhist temples scattered throughout many cities. Most of these places of worship — such as many of the old churches in Europe that attract tourists with their photo-ready exotic sculptures — no longer function. Certainly, Hindu and Buddhist temples were built much earlier than mosques and churches, where believers are still coming to listen to preachers’ words. What is also obvious is that the number of majority Sunni Muslim mosques is noticeably increasing. In 1997 the Religious Affairs Ministry recorded 392,044 mosques. In 2004 the number was 643,834. Now the number has likely doubled or tripled. “Nevertheless, you may wonder why the ‘majority’ is so scared of the ‘minority’. ” The increase in the number of mosques can be felt whenever you visit an Indonesian city — provincial, district, or subdistrict — you will find a new mosque with a shiny dome. Mosques dominate many cities’ landscapes. In front of the Prambanan temples in Yogyakarta a mosque stands mightily. In the heart of Pekalongan, Central Java, a large mosque was built in front of an old church. Mosques are also found in malls, schools and other public places. Remember that before the 1990s, mosques were not as numerous as they are now. Yet there is no evidence to suggest there is significant growth in the number of mosques belonging to minority groups, e.g. Shiite, Ahmadiyah, Tarekat and other Muslim minorities. Nor is there a significant rise in the number of churches in Indonesia, such as those of Roman Catholics, Protestants, Eastern Orthodox, and others. Why are many so anxious about the construction of places of worship other than their own? Clearly the idea that there is an increase in faiths other than Sunni and rising missionary activities is mythical. Many scholarly studies have shown this. However, the anxiety and the spread of the myth are not fairytales. They are real. Keep in mind that the Sunni majority can build a mosque anywhere they choose, any time they want, in any form they desire and without special permission from any authority or the government, even though minority groups are required to obtain permission before building their places of worship. The number of mosques and churches demonstrates this.

"Thu, October 21 2010","Govt must protect Ahmadiyah, other minorities: Golkar","The government has a constitutional obligation to protect Ahmadiyah and other minority religious groups and must take action against violence directed against them, says a Golkar Party representative. Speaking at a press conference at the end of the party’s three-day leadership meeting in Jakarta on Wednesday, Golkar’s patron board chair Akbar Tandjung said the government had no authority to interfere in Ahmadiyah’s internal affairs, including its religious teachings, and should take action against hard-line groups that burned down Ahmadiyah mosques and other buildings in several cities in the country. “Our party has proposed a bill on religious freedom to help provide protection for all people, including minorities.” “In the name of Pancasila — the state ideology — and the diversity of the nation, the government cannot prohibit Ahmadis from following their own teachings, which are different from the true Islam followed by the majority of Muslims. The government also has to guarantee Ahmadis their fundamental right to their faith,” he said. Hard-line groups launched a string of attacks on Ahmadiyah followers and their buildings in Banten, West Java, and West Nusa Tenggara over the last several years. Ahmadis accept Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, instead of Muhammad, as their last prophet. Hundreds of Islam Defenders Front (FPI) followers burned Ahmadi houses in Parung, Bogor, last month. Earlier, several hard-line groups sealed mosques belonging to Ahmadis in Kuningan, West Java, demanding the government disband the sect. Despite the 2008 joint ministerial decree accepting Ahmadiyah’s existence, Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali asked Ahmadis to dissolve their sect and come back to the true Islam. Golkar slammed the government for its slow response to the recent FPI assault on HKBP church ministers in Bekasi, West Java, and is determined to campaign for religious tolerance to counter increasing intolerance among Muslims. Golkar chairman Aburizal Bakrie said his party, one of the nationalist parties, together with the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), the Greater Indonesian Movement Party (Gerindra) and the People’s Conscience Party (Hanura), was deeply concerned about the deterioration of national attachment towards Pancasila among the people. The declining implementation of and respect for Pancasila has been demonstrated by the increase in social disharmony, increasing intolerance among the Muslim majority and increasing terrorism and the emergence of terrorist cells, said Aburizal. When asked why Golkar had remained silent amid the government’s slow response to minority attacks, Aburizal said his party was not an executive body, although it was included in the pro-government coalition. “Our party has proposed a bill on religious freedom to help provide protection for all people, including minorities,” he said. Golkar and local party members in Banten, West Sumatra, South Sulawesi and West Nusa Tenggara have been involved in the issuance of sharia-inspired bylaws, as previously reported.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/10/21/govt-must-protect-ahmadiyah-other-minorities-golkar.html,,2010
"Tue, November 16 2010",Letter: Debate on issues of tolerance,"This refers to comments made by a man who calls himself “Euroman”, who has lived in Jakarta for six months. His comments were posted through The Jakarta Post website in regards to an article titled “Did Indonesia minister shake US First Lady’s hand?” (Nov. 8). Euroman: I am told to be careful when I’m out in case I encounter the FPI or others. Why? I assume it’s because I have white skin and I must be a Christian and therefore a legitimate target. My friends think they are helping me when actually I just feel oppressed and bullied. Tolerant? My answer: Actually you are looking at the negative here. Most Indonesians are very helpful and welcoming to any stranger. Your colleagues are just making sure that you are safe in what is a foreign city for you. Euroman: I was advised not to go to the gay arts festival because I might be a target of violence, since if I go I must be gay. This advice was from an official government source and also published in this newspaper. I don’t mind gay people and some of the movies are emotionally and intellectually stimulating and challenging, but I am not a gay. I see the irony that the same fighters proclaim a loyalty to the Wahhibi principles of Saudi Arabia, where buggery is simply a way of life for many men. A: Just because 200 people from hard-line groups demonstrate against this does not mean that the whole country hates homosexuals. Any parent would hope that their child grows up to be straight, and that is only natural. In fact, I notice far more effeminate gays in Asia than I do in Europe. Euroman: I see in the news and on TV the internal persecution and violence Indonesian’s have towards each other in every possible sphere of life. Tolerant? A: To generalize that there is violence in every sphere of Indonesian life is a ridiculous assertion. Is there some racism and intolerance that results in violence? Of course there is, but that does not make it a national characteristic. Euroman: I see nationalistic wailing designed at nothing more than stirring trouble against other nationalities. I reference almost anything to do with Malaysia, China or the US. Your government risks violent conflict with Malaysia and demands a minimum wage for [Indonesian] house staff there. Do you have a minimum wage here? Do you treat your house staff well? I am sure you think you do, but I’m also sure you know someone who does not. I do not see any protests against the abuse of [Indonesian] maids in Saudi Arabia or other rich Middle East states. A: It is easy to rally the uneducated masses to support a nationalistic cause. Politicians and the media are oft at fault here for this. I do find it alarming at the outbursts against their near neighbors, who are basically the same people. Euroman: I see Christians harangued from their worship – even stabbed, reference Bekasi. The governors and clerics call for a war against Christians and the police and governments do nothing. At the same time, known extremist clerics teach hatred in schools and mosques. Tolerant? A: Agreed, except that does not make the whole population intolerant.

"Mon, November 22 2010",Ariel asks fans not to come to trial,"Antara JAKARTA: Peterpan vocalist Nazril “Ariel” Irham has asked his fans not to come to the first day of his court trial today, an attempt to avoid them clashing with a hard-liner Islamic group expected to come to the trial. The first session of Ariel’s trial for alleged creation of pornographic content in the form of two sex videos featuring him, was set to begin on Monday at Bandung District Court, West Java. “Tomorrow, it will be better [for my fans] not to come to the court, [because] later they might be confronted by them,” said Ariel, referring to the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), which declared it would come to the court. “It will be enough that I am alone,” Ariel said to his fans last weekend during a prayer gathering held at the vocalist’s home in Bandung. Ariel told kompas.com that he was ready for the trial, after being detained for five months in police custody. He declined to comment on the FPI’s plan to come to the court building Monday. FPI announced it would send some of its members to Bandung to “monitor” the trial.

"Fri, December 10 2010","Ahmadiyah mosque, other facilities closed in Tasikmalaya","Ahmadiyah members in Tasikmalaya, West Java, have been gripped with fear following the closure of two of their facilities in the area on Wednesday by the Community Faith and Supervision Coordinating Board (Bakorpakem). The closure took place after a meeting, demanded by the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), which said Ahmadiyah activities were still carried out by the group in the area despite the issuance of a joint-decree by three ministers on banning Ahmadiyah activities in 2009. Head of the Tasikmalaya Ahmadiyah chapter Encang Zarkasih said Bakorpakem closed a mosque on Jl. Nagarawangi, Cihideung district, and the Al-Kautsar foster home in Cariang village, Kawalu district, located around 6 kilometers apart. “When we asked them where we would pray, they said it is your own business,” said Encang. Encang added that four Ahmadiyah representatives attended the meeting at the Tasikmalaya Bakorpakem on Wednesday. The meeting was also attended by Tasikmalaya chapter Indonesian Ulema Council head Acep Noor Mubarok, police chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Hendra Suhartiono, military command chief Let. Col. Bahram and around 20 FPI members. “The meeting focused more on defaming Ahmadiyah after the FPI urged the closure of the mosque and foster home. We went home dismayed due to the closure of our worship places,” Encang said on Thursday. Tasikmalaya chapter FPI representative Wahyu said it was furious because Ahmadiyah was still carrying out its activities openly and breached the joint-ministerial decree. “The Tasikmalaya municipality tends to be indecisive in handling the issue so we urged the government to ban all Ahmadiyah activities,” said Wahyu. The Ahmadiyah members became more tense Thursday when a group of FPI members using motorcycles rode through the city and threatened to burn their facilities. Al-Kautsar foster home caretaker Iyon Sofyan said police had initially asked orphanage authorities to lock the home themselves before they locked it from the outside, but they refused. “Why should I lock my own home. I refused. The police also asked everyone to exit, but those inside refused to do so,” said Iyon.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/12/10/ahmadiyah-mosque-other-facilities-closed-tasikmalaya.html,,2010

"Thu, December 16 2010",Christians uneasy over FPI guardian angel pledge,"The Indonesian Communion of Churches (PGI) and the Indonesian Bishop’s Conference (KWI) said on Wednesday the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) had not spoken to them about its plan to help guard churches during Christmas. The PGI and the KWI denied they had had any contact with the FPI. “We never made any agreement with the FPI. We never even communicate with them,” PGI chairman Andreas Anangguru Yewangoe said. Benny Susetyo, KWI Secretary for Interfaith Relations, who learned about the FPI initiative from newspapers, said he was puzzled by the news as KWI had not had any contact with the FPI. “Besides, we are not in charge of security. This is handled by archdioceses, which have their own security measures. KWI is a separate organization,” he said. Benny said churches had their own security arrangements, in which local parishes usually liaised with local police. On Tuesday, FPI leader Rizieq Shihab went to the Jakarta Police headquarters to offer the police his help in safeguarding Christmas celebrations at churches. Responding to the FPI plan, Christians in the city showed signs of being uneasy with the prospect of performing Christmas services under the watchful eyes of FPI members. A number of Christians said they would likely feel intimidated by the presence of FPI members in the vicinity of their churches. “To tell you the truth, I won’t feel safe being guarded by the FPI considering the way they have treated Christians in the past,” said Agung Pambudi, a member of St. Matius Church in Bintaro, South Tangerang. He respected the good intentions of the FPI though, as they would set an example of religious harmony. “If they are sincere, we will have no problem accepting their offer. But police and the church community should keep an eye on them.” Lusiana Diah Ningsih, a member of the St. Matias Rasul congregation in Kosambi, West Jakarta, did not want to have FPI members around her church, especially if they were dressed in strict Islamic garb, saying “it was very intimidating”.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/12/16/christians-uneasy-over-fpi-guardian-angel-pledge.html,,2010
"Sun, December 19 2010",The Week In Review: Between soccer and politics,"It has been a while since Indonesians cheered and danced as one and momentarily forgot their problems, as they did while sharing the joy of the red-and-white national soccer team’s glory at the 2010 ASEAN Football Federation Suzuki Cup. Since scoring five goals against Malaysia in the cup’s opening match, the Indonesian team smoothly routed Laos 6-0 and then beat Thailand 2-1 – Indonesia’s first victory over Thailand in 12 years – to top the group. Indonesia is on track to play in the cup’s finals after beating the Philippines 1-0 in the first semifinal match at Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta on Thursday night. The victory was greeted with joy by the crowd, including President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his entourage. Still, there is more to come. The second semifinal match will be held on Sunday at Bung Karno Stadium. The winner will earn a ticket to the finals and challenge the winner of the other semifinal showdown between Malaysia and defending champion Vietnam. It did not come as a big surprise when members of the House of Representatives passed less than half of the bills targeted for this year. The law on political parties that was passed Thursday was the last piece of legislation for the year. Many critical bills, including the Financial Services Authority (OJK) bill, have to wait. The House concluded the year with only 15 bills passed into law, and are carrying over another 55 bills to next year. Recently, the House was under fire for financing foreign trips for certain commissions and committees for different purposes, from comparative studies to haj pilgrimage supervision, at a time when the country was being rocked by natural disasters. Legislators also secured the government’s approval to expand the legislative buildings in Senayan, Central Jakarta, and allotted Rp 250 billion (US$27.75 million) of the state’s budget for early funding. But, the House failed to pass the housing and settlement bill that would have set the groundwork for the expansion of public housing programs. Christmas celebrations are just around the corner, but a pledge by the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) to help guard churches during the celebratory time has made Christians feel uneasy. The Indonesian Communion of Churches and the Indonesian Bishop’s Conference were unaware of the FPI plan and said they had never made any agreement — or even communicated — with the FPI. A number of Christians said they would likely feel intimidated by the presence of FPI members in the vicinity of their churches during Christmas services. If the plan is a sincere one and comes from good intentions, the FPI will be helping to set an example of religious harmony. But, considering the FPI’s notoriety for attacking minority groups, Christians have every reason to be cautious. The time has come to clear up the confusion as to who is in charge of security and protecting the people. The Constitution clearly says the state guarantees everyone’s freedom to adhere to their religion and perform their religious duties in line with their religion and faith. The government and the House of Representatives finally agreed Tuesday to restrict the sale of subsidized gasoline. Under the fuel reform policy, the sale of subsidized gasoline will only be allowed for public transport vehicles, motorcycles and small fishing boats. Jakarta and its surrounding cities will be given three months for logistical preparations until the program starts in April, and then the policy will expand to other parts of Java and Bali in July and to Sumatra and Kalimantan in 2013. Fuel subsidies have long been a source of headache. They have been criticized as a misallocation of scarce resources, as more than 55 percent of subsidies are enjoyed by private car owners instead of being set aside to provide better healthcare and education for the country’s many low-income and poor people. The decision has been praised as a positive signal for the market, indicating Indonesia’s fiscal sustainability with the steady rise in oil prices. The move will also indirectly help push for green practices, with businesses preferring fuel-efficient technology and investing in fuel-conservation programs. The challenge will be how to implement the policy transparently and strengthen control over the distribution of subsidized fuel to prevent abuse. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was again in the hot seat this week with legislators criticizing him for stalling for nearly a month the inauguration of new anti-graft commission chief Busyro Muqoddas, following his appointment by the House of Representatives. The President’s dawdling will certainly burden the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) and prevent it from doing its work, with many cases waiting to be handled. It also creates the impression the President is deliberately trying to undermine the commission and its work. The Yogyakarta provincial legislative council agreed Monday to continue the traditional procedure of governor’s appointments. The decision means that the Sultan of Yogyakarta will continue to be appointed the province’s governor, while the vice governor will continue to come from Pakualaman principality. The decision is still pending approval by a House of Representatives session, but remains a blow to President  Yudhoyono’s suggestion that Yogyakarta’s governor should be decided through elections just like in other parts of the country. In past weeks, the President’s statement about Yogyakarta’s special status has triggered controversy and caused unproductive political spats. — Stevie Emilia",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/12/19/theweekinreview-between-soccer-and-politics.html,,2010

"Mon, December 20 2010",Between ideas and acts: Anticipating radicalism in 2011,"In 2010, Indonesia witnessed the police’s triumph, and in particular that of the special antiterrorist squad Densus 88, over terrorists. The successful year was preceded by a long effort that peaked with the killing of top terrorist suspect Noordin M. Top in 2009. However, terrorism is not a consequence of cause, but of result. Terrorism is an act triggered by ideas. The acts of terrorists do not stand alone. Ideology, plans, strategy and network precede these acts. Thus, if the police chase after these terrorists and eventually catch, or even shoot them, that would not mean an end to the story. Ideas cannot be eradicated by the deaths of those who promoted them. People may die, but their ideas live on. In fact, the network runs well. Its gears of recruitment are still active. The cell system has operated confidentiality and the continuation of the movement can be guaranteed. When a group is annihilated, another group, with its robust branches, grows. The cell system is in fact not new in Indonesian history. Communist movements — prior and after Indonesia declared independence — employed this tactic, with loyalty of and a mode of expansion that was impressive. With regard to this method of developing an organization, nowadays terrorism, particularly in Southeast Asia, and communism a long ago are deemed comparable. Thus, we should not put the task of annihilating terrorism on the police alone, who will never be able to eradicate all aspects of terrorism. By the same token, do not persecute too many people, simply because they are suspected of having connections with certain radical groups. Indonesians should learn more lessons from the way in which the communist movement was extinguished in 1965 under the banner of Soeharto’s New Order. The regime imposed strict rule upon its own citizens by screening for signs of communism. The New Order regime successfully frightened its own people. Communism was defined as Marxism which teaches atheism, according to which God does not exist — a doctrine that would destroy this nation. If those who are suspected of terrorism are treated in the same way as those alleged communists were, old mistakes will be repeated. In fact, everybody, with no exception, deserves equality and unprejudiced treatment. So far, the war against terrorism has been conducted through a campaign of hunting “terrorists”. If this method is still employed in the future, the root cause of terrorism — namely the ideas that precede its actions — will remain untouched. In short, this method has a blatant flaw. In fact, many Indonesians — who have boldly appeared in public and have had so far plenty of room and freedom to voice their radical dogmatic views — share the ideology that the terrorists embrace. To put it differently, the ideology firmly held by radicals is spreading in Indonesian society. According to this ideology, the world is sharply divided between the believers and infidels, and war should be waged against those who fall into the second category. Many mass organizations in this country — the FPI (Islam Defenders Front), the HTI (Indonesian Hizbut Tahrir), the FUI (Islamic Community’s Forum) and the MMI (Mujahidin Council of Indonesia) to mention but a few — exhibit dogmatic and narrow minded religious interpretations of various issues in Indonesia. Worse still, they intimidate the moderate majority Indonesian Muslims and non-Muslims. These groups dictate the public by arrogantly showing that what they offer is the only “truth”, whereas those who stand against them are categorized as misleading. In showing their might in response to many cases, they hold mass rallies on the streets, demanding the government meet their needs. This can be seen in their responses to the pornography bill in the case of the Playboy magazine chief editor, of Ariel’s and Luna Maya’s video tape, their demand to remove Obama’s statue in Menteng, and many others. Unfortunately, the government often gives into their demands. In imposing their dogma upon the public, these groups also demonstrate their “shallow” reasoning in the media. They force the public to follow the way they think. This can be seen in the way in which they articulate arguments in defending their atrocities, such as the stabbing of priests in Ciketing, Bekasi, the mass attack on Ahmadiyah, their support for Sharia local ordinances, and their support for all edicts pronounced by the MUI (Indonesian Ulema Council). The HTI also relentlessly promotes their most valuable commodity, namely khilafah (a traditional Islamic system of monarchy). No matter how sophisticatedly some experts of Islam already can explain the concept of true ancient khilafah, which is very different from theirs, this group persistently hold that their own concept of khilafah should replace the current democracy we are nurturing. Apparently, Indonesians are not interested in buying into any Islamist agenda in politics. The people prefer secular political parties to Islamist parties. Learning lessons from this, the PKS (the Prosperous Justice Party) has applied a new gambit. To fix their image, this “Islamist” party states that they intend to accept the values of pluralism as clearly defined by Pancasila (the Five Principles). Nobody, except God, knows whether they are telling the truth or not. Nevertheless, the Indonesian future generation is still at stake. In fact, radical ideas have already penetrated public schools, universities and mosques. In the curriculum set up for these educational institutions, religion, particularly Islam, is treated as a mere symbol rather than as a set of ideal moral values and spirituality. As a result, more female students wear veils (jilbab) in order to look pious. The spirit of tolerance, and inter-faith dialogue is not being cultivated. Thus, in 2011, the campaign should be waged not only against acts of terrorism but also against the root causes of this, namely ideas and ideology, from which terrorists were inspired to commit atrocities. Never underestimate ideas.

"Fri, December 24 2010",Insight: Guarding a merry and bright Christmas,"May your days be merry and bright, and may all your Christmases be white On Dec. 25 Christians all over the world celebrate Christmas. For many, to have a merry and bright Christmas will require a number of things. Special dishes, cookies, presents, and holiday cards are among the common things being prepared. Decorating homes with lights and trees are also two important features of Christmas. If the weather or the situation permits, many like to go caroling – going around the city or a neighborhood in a group singing Christmas songs (carols). For those who live in colder climes, of course, they wish for snow to make their Christmas a white one. More than anything else, however, Christmas needs to be celebrated in a peaceful, secure, and tranquil surrounding. How can this — a merry and bright Christmas — be realized? In today’s Indonesia, in several of its largest cities in particular, to have such a Christmas is still a wonder. Several years ago, in the early period of democratic transition, we had very disheartening and bitter Christmas celebrations. Senseless attacks were launched by human beings aimed at those who were attending religious services. This was a very sad occurrence indeed, especially at a time when religious piety is supposed to be at its height, our bonds of humanity and brotherhood strengthened and our sense of tolerance deepened. Since then many Christians have been haunted by a specter of disharmony as if disruptions might recur whenever Christmas was celebrated. In situations such as this, when many Christians still wonder about their upcoming celebrations, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) has offered to lend a hand to help guard churches when Christians are celebrating Christmas. Taking into account the perceived reputation of the organization, which has often been involved in violent activities, one can only wonder why such an offer was made. Is it possible that FPI has actually been moved by the concerns of many Christians? Or was it a tacit declaration of guilt on the part of FPI over the involvement of their members in a raid of a home in Bandung allegedly used as a place of worship? Under these circumstances, one is likely to speculate that the gesture may reflect a sense of guilt. This may not necessarily be related to the religious beliefs of FPI members, but more to what they had done and the destruction they had caused. Regardless of their motivation, we don’t know for sure whether Christians will accept or reject the offer. Considering how Christians and the FPI relate to each other, which is characterized by a high degree of suspicious and enmity, it is likely that Christians would turn down the offer. This is not the first time an Islamic organization has offered to lend a hand to Christians to celebrate Christmas. Several years ago, Nahdlatul Ulama’s youth wing, Ansor, also helped protect Christmas celebrations. A couple of years ago, Muhammadiyah also issued a statement that Christians were welcome to use Muhammadiyah buildings if they encountered difficulties celebrating Christmas. Undoubtedly, those initiatives were noble endeavors. They demonstrated a high degree of tolerance on the part of the country’s two biggest Islamic organizations — Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama. They indicated a strong bond of humanity and brotherhood among many Indonesian Muslims towards their fellow Christians. Yet one may ask if it is really necessary for Muslims to guard churches or for Christians to guard mosques when Muslims are celebrating their feast day. In normal situations, where the state functions effectively, the answer would definitely be no. It is incumbent upon the government and existing law enforcement officials to provide proper and decent protection to all citizens regardless of their religious creeds and beliefs. As any civics textbook will tell us, the common practice of functional states and one of their clear primary duties is to create a stable and safe environment. The non-existence of such a condition may only lead to the declaration of a dysfunctional – if not failed — state. Obviously, it is not easy for Indonesia to provide a much-needed tranquil situation for Christians — or any other religious denomination for that matter — so that they don’t have to wonder whether or not disruptions will occur while they are performing religious services. Law enforcement is still one among the country’s many weakest spots, especially in the aftermath of democratic transition. When and if the state is able to do what it is supposed to do — providing stability and security, as well as generating wealth for prosperity — only then can Christians enjoy a truly merry and bright Christmas. May your days be merry and bright, and may all your Christmases be white.

"Fri, December 24 2010","Some 8,000 troops prepare for the holidays","Jakarta security institutions will deploy thousands of personnel to secure this year’s celebration of Christmas and could possibly embrace assistance proposals from other organizations, officials say. Christmas security will be ensured by 8,300 specially deployed officers — 7,200 from the police, with the remainder comprised of Indonesian Military (TNI) and public order institutions, Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Sutarman said on Thursday. The officers will begin their operation from Dec. 24 to Jan. 2 in approximately 1,600 houses of worship and 878 entertainment spots. Jakarta Police public relations head Sr. Comr. Baharudin Jafar said that large churches were the main security focus this Christmas, such as the Jakarta Cathedral in Central Jakarta, the Santa Church in South Jakarta, and the Batak Protestant Church (HKBP) Tebet, also in South Jakarta. Ten years after the Christmas bombing carnage in 2000, fear remains among Christians and the public as a whole. Information suggesting that separatist movements and terrorists could launch a violent campaign during Christmas had been discovered by authorities, Governor Fauzi Bowo said on Thursday. In Jakarta, the Christmas bombs struck the Koinonia Church in Matraman, the Oikoumene Church in Halim Perdana Kusuma, the Cathedral in Gambir, and the Santo Yosef Church in Matraman. The chairman of the National Antiterrorism Agency (BNPT), Insp. Gen. (ret.) Ansyaad Mbai, recently said that despite the deaths and arrests of numerous terrorist leaders recently, the chance that the remaining members of radical, hard-line groups could launch an attack still existed. Baharudin said police had been gathering intelligence data 24 hours a day to secure Christmas celebrations. Sutarman said that Jakarta’s overall condition remained secure but the police would not let their guard down. “We deployed a lot of undercover policemen in churches long before these Christmas operations began,” he said. Sutarman also said that the public should be more cautious, and report to the police immediately if they spot any suspicious people or activity during this Christmas season. Previously, the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), a group notorious for attacking minority groups, said that it would like to help guard churches during Christmas. FPI leader Rizieq Shihab went to Jakarta Police Headquarters last week to offer the police his help in safeguarding Christmas celebrations at churches. “We hope Christians can peacefully revel in Christmas. They have the right [to celebrate Christmas] and we have to respect that,” Rizieq said. Baharudin said that the police had no official plan to establish cooperation with the FPI or any other mass organizations to defend Christmas. “However, we will not forbid anyone willing to help us protect Christmas. If anyone wishes to help us, they can contact their local police precinct and the chief of that precinct will have the full authority to coordinate Christmas security strategies with the local public,” Baharudin said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/12/24/some-8000-troops-prepare-holidays.html,,2010

The defendants, including the leader of the Bekasi FPI branch, Raya Murhali Barda, will stand trial for battery charges and violating the criminal code for using violence against members of Batak Christian Protestant Church (HKBP) congregation on Sept. 12. Police in Bekasi dispatched 300 personnel to secure the trial, as more than 500 supporters of the defendants are expected to turn up at the Bekasi District Court. Bekasi Police chief Sr. Comr.

"Thu, December 30 2010",FPI leaders stand trial for church attack,"Thirteen defendants, including the chairman of the Bekasi branch of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), stood before the court in five separate trials Wednesday on charges of attacking a reverend and a member of a church congregation in Bekasi in September. In the first trial, prosecutors sought seven years in prison for the defendants, including Bekasi FPI branch leader Raya Murhali Barda, for battery and violence against a reverend and a member of the Huria Batak Protestant Church (HKBP). “The defendants collectively perpetrated violence against the victims,” prosecutor TM Pakpahan said in the hearing at Bekasi District Court. The Bekasi Prosecutor’s Office decided to expedite the trials. On Wednesday, trials for the 13 defendants were held in five different courtrooms. A member of the FPI defense team said that the charges were vague. “We will easily challenge their argument,” said defense lawyer Salih Mangara Sitompul. On Sept. 12, the defendants attacked HKBP Church Rev. Luspida Simanjuntak and a member of the congregation, Hasian Sihombing, after a long-simmering conflict between church members and local Muslims who objected to the construction of the church. Hasian was stabbed in the abdomen while Luspida was struck on the head with a wooden plank, according to witnesses and police reports. Shortly after the attack, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono condemned the violence and ordered the police to investigate the case. “I have instructed all officials at the central and local government to take steps to find a solution to the conflict over places of worship,” Yudhoyono said after a meeting with then National Police chief Gen. Bambang Hendarso Danuri and Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Djoko Suyanto. In October 2008, FPI leader Riziq Shihab was sentenced to 1.5 years in prison for his role in an attack against Muslim liberal activists rallying at the National Monument (Monas) Park to call for religious moderation and tolerance. A recent survey by the human rights watchdog Setara Institute found that Bekasi is the least tolerant region in Greater Jakarta, with 74 percent of respondents rejecting the construction of places of worship of other religions in their neighborhoods.

"Wed, January 19 2011",Conference on 1965 tragedy overshadowed by FPI threat,"Many believe that the aborted communist coup of 1965 was the result of a global conflict between world superpowers. What is less understood is the impact of the coup and the events that succeeded it on world politics. In an attempt to shed light on what many consider the country’s darkest hour, the German Cultural Center Goethe Institut is currently holding a conference on the subject. “The title of our conference is ‘Indonesia and the World in 1965’. So, we will not only talk about what really happened back then but its impact on the world,” Goethe programming division head Diniah Latuconsina said. In its official statement, Goethe Institut said that the motive behind the conference was to get a new perspective on what really happened when an aborted coup blamed on the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) led to the murder of hundreds of thousands people. In the four-day conference between Jan. 18 and Jan. 21, experts including John Roosa, author of the controversial book Pretext for Mass Murder, will speak in a session titled  “Indonesia in the Cold War Game: The Rise of Soeharto and the involvement of the world leaders” on Jan. 21. Given the incendiary topics discussed in the conference, Goethe Institut has requested the police guard against threats from radical groups, including the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), which has threatened to close down the conference. Goethe Institut cultural officer Lely Cabe said precautionary measures had been taken to protect the conference from the FPI. “The police are ready and prepared for any possibilities,” said Lely. On Tuesday, rumors abounded that FPI members would mob the Goethe Haus building. The threat materialized when dozens of people who called themselves members of the Youth Islamic Movement (GPI) staged a rally in front of the building, calling for the conference to be called off. Protesters carried banner denouncing the defunct PKI. The FPI denied that GPI was part of its organization. “I don’t know about that group. Our members are now busy preparing for events to celebrate the birth of Prophet Muhammad,” FPI Jakarta head Salim Alatas said as quoted by tempointeraktif.com. — JP/Hans David Tampubolon",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/19/conference-1965-tragedy-overshadowed-fpi-threat.html,,2011
"Mon, January 31 2011",FPI mobs Ahmadiyah mosque,"Dozens of Islam Defenders Front (FPI) youth mobbed an Ahmadiyah secretariat office and mosque in Makassar, South Sulawesi, on Saturday. The group tried to drive away Ahmadis and demanded the local administration disband Ahmadiyah. Ahmadiyah has come under attack in recent years from Islamic hardliners who believe that Ahmadiyah is a heretical version of Islam. Police officers, who had been deployed in the area since Friday, attempted to secure the area. The FPI called for the Ahmadis to leave the premises and for a halt to all their activities. The angry youths, dressed in FPI style with white robes and hats, then vandalized a plaque at the office and the walls of the Ahmadiyah mosque on Jl. Anuang. They also burned a poster of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who Ahmadis consider their prophet. The Indonesian government has been searching for a way to resolve the Ahmadiyah issue following attacks on Ahmadi homes and places of worship in various parts of the country. So far, no resolution has been achieved. The FPI youth were led by Habib Reza bin Muhfyn. They dispersed after about an hour, but soon returned, saying they would not leave until all the Ahmadiyah members present, who had sought safety in the mosque, were removed from the site. The police, led by South Sulawesi Police chief Insp. Gen. Johny Wainal Usman, attempted to evacuate the Ahmadis from the mosque, located adjacent to the secretariat office. Most of the Ahmadis vigorously opposed their evacuation. Dozens of Ahmadiyah followers insisted on staying in the mosque and locked all the doors. Ahmadiyah secretariat caretaker Jamaluddin said Ahmadiyah did not disturb followers of other religions. There was no reason for them to leave, he said. “We will stay here because this is our home. We do not have any problem with the FPI or any other groups. We are not afraid,” he said. The South Sulawesi Police later forced the Ahmadis to evacuate amid the heightening tension. Police officers broke the lock on the mosque at 9:15 p.m. and removed all the people present, including 25 women and 11 children. They were taken to the Makassar police station in two vans and a truck. Some Ahmadiyah members reportedly managed to flee through the mosque’s back door. The previous day, FPI members had gone to the Ahmadiyah secretariat and warned them about possible actions against them in the future.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/31/fpi-mobs-ahmadiyah-mosque.html,,2011
"Tue, February 1 2011",Issue: Police evacuate Ahmadis amid threat,"Jan. 29, Online South Sulawesi Police used force to evacuate around 40 Ahmadiyah followers from their mosque on Jl. Anuang, Makassar, amid heightened tension in the vicinity with the presence of a hardline Muslim group. Police officers broke the mosque’s locked door at 9:15 p.m. local time and removed all Ahmadiyah members, including 25 women and 11 children. They were taken away by the Makassar Police in two vans and one truck. Some Ahmadiyah members reportedly managed to flee using a backdoor. These members locked themselves in the mosque following a rally by a hardline group claiming to be members of the South Sulawesi’s Islam Defenders Front (FPI). The mob vandalized the mosque’s door and brought down the address board in front of the office using an electric saw. The mob shouted at the Ahmadiyah members and ordered them to leave the mosque. Dozens of police who had safeguarded the vicinity since Friday reportedly allowed the mob to turn violent. Makassar Police deputy chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Endi Sutendi claimed that they evacuated the Ahmadiyah members amid concern for their safety. When asked about the vandalism, Endi said, “We will process that later.” Your comments: With the police standing by and looking on, it gives a perfect picture of how the authorities are handling the allegedly guaranteed “freedom of religion”. It’s a disgrace! Linda Jakarta They should be praised for their action. The government makes strong noises about the sect from 2008 but do not act. The FPI and the police are doing the job for them.

Widya Utama Bergen Why were the police trying to remove the Ahmadiyah from their mosque? They had a right to be there. It was the FPI mob that was breaking the law and behaving in an intimidating way, so why weren’t they removed? When will the government wake up and recognize the FPI as an urban terrorist gang which repeatedly terrorizes ordinary law-abiding citizens, destroys property and generally sets itself up as a de facto law enforcement agency. We hear not one utterance from the President or government ministers condemning this organization, which leads us to believe they support these thugs. Now they are infesting Makassar. Its time to draw the line before this mob wants to be the government. FPI Makassar should be put on the next boat back to Jakarta. We don’t need them to mess up our diverse and tolerant city.

"Wed, February 2 2011","Issue: Ariel gets 3 years, 6 months in prison","Jan. 31, Online Popular Indonesian singer Nazriel Irham, aka “Ariel Peterpan”, has been sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison and ordered to pay Rp 250 million in fines for his alleged role in the production and distribution of pornographic videos. The verdict was lighter than the five-year term demanded by prosecutors. Ariel’s legal adviser, OC Kaligis, immediately voiced objections. “The court has handed down three-and-a-half years imprisonment to Nazriel Irham,” presiding judge Singgih Budi Prakoso said at the Bandung District Court on Monday. Kaligis said the charges against Ariel had not been assessed carefully, particularly as many of Ariel’s alleged legal violations took place in 2008.  “His alleged violations occurred before the law was made,” Kaligis said. Your comments: Even Ariel’s lawyer said he was worried if Ariel were acquitted — how weird is that. The sentence was to appease SBY and the hard-liners. I remember it was SBY who made such loud noises over this case and that the guilty should be prosecuted. Shame he wasn’t so vociferous over the FPI radicals and their creating mayhem. I think we will see this go to appeal very quickly and very quietly and he will be acquitted. That is unless the power brokers have ensured that he must serve time. I have to agree with most other comments here — the law and justice in this country is just a sick joke. Dennis Surabaya Forget about claims of Indonesia being a moderate country, it is run by the religious police. Sheldon Probolinggo, East Java That’s a crazy verdict!

The whole world will laugh at us and think the Taliban have taken control. Poor Indonesia and shame on judge Singgih Budi Prakoso. He thinks he is a hero. Dewi Jakarta The rule of law is dead today in Indonesia with the sentencing of Ariel. There were once high hopes in concepts such as justice, honesty, freedom, wisdom, common sense, decency, conscience, democracy and equality. In one fell swoop they have all gone. It’s seemingly OK for religious fanatics to threaten life and limb, even kill, maim, loot and burn with impunity. The judiciary has demonstrated that it’s a joke, a cruel, pathetic caricature of wisdom, prostrating itself in front of a mob of mindless fools, terrified of the consequences and setting the worst possible precedent. There seems to be no plans to stop the increasingly arrogant and complacent Islamic thuggery, violence, graft and corruption which are geared towards making a misery of the lives of fellow Indonesians whose beliefs differ from the mainstream. Pak SBY, you were warned. You fiddled and hid your head in your hands. You didn’t care or understand, and now it may be too late. You should be indicted for indecision and incompetence, and for not upholding the Constitution. Let’s hope Ariel is a strong lad. He will need to be. He doesn’t have corrupt friends in high places like the others. I hope the outside world takes note. Maurice Sanur, Bali Once again the Indonesian justice system is shown to be an embarrassing joke: Making a naughty video with his girl friend — three-and-a-half years; getting caught with less than a gram of marijuana — five years; stealing Rp 28 billion from the public purse — seven years; paying for a judge to be assassinated — four years; torturing a Papuan — 10 months and attacking a religious minority group — not even charged.

"Sat, February 5 2011",Inter-religious forum condemns Ahmadiyah attack,"MAKASSAR, South Sulawesi: The Inter-religious Forum condemned the National Police for indecision on the hate crimes in South Sulawesi during last week’s attack of an Ahmadiyah congregation. The condemnation was disclosed at a meeting by forum members with academics and representatives of NGOs at the Alauddin State Islam University campus in Makassar on Friday. The meeting was aimed primarily to discuss how to preserve harmonious life among embers of the communities in the face of violence, in the name of religion. On Jan. 28, 2011 police “evacuated” members of the Ahmadiyah congregation from their mosque in Makassar amid increasingly threatening protests by members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). The FPI later attacked the mosque, destroying property and breaking windows. “The police should have acted firmly against FPI members by preventing vandalism and violently acting against Ahmadiyah followers,” said Qasim Mathar, one of the forum’s supporters. Previously, the Human Rights Watch also condemned the police for “tolerating” the FPI’s violent acts. “The Indonesian Police may have believed they were taking the Ahmadiyah out of harm’s way, but they let the mob go on a rampage,” Elaine Pearson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch said Thursday. “The authorities need to send a message that hate crimes won’t be tolerated by prosecuting those responsible.” — JP",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/02/05/interreligious-forum-condemns-ahmadiyah-attack.html,,2011
"Thu, February 10 2011",Hard-liners vow to attack Ahmadiyah in Tasikmalaya,"A group claiming to represent the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) in Tasikmalaya, West Java, vowed on Wednesday to launch sweeping raids against Ahmadiyah property unless the organization was disbanded within 24 hours. The threat seemingly mocked President Susilo Bambang Yudho-yono’s call to disband organizations that engage in anarchic violence, which he said threatened national unity and religious harmony. Yu-dhoyono made his call at a speech on Wednesday marking National Press Day in Kupang. About 100 people riding on motorbikes and four trucks protested in front of the Tasikmalaya legislative council building on Wednesday, voicing opposition to Ahmadiyah. “We just want Ahmadiyah to not use the name of Islam because they are not Islam. They have a different prophet and use the Tadzikoroh, not the Koran,” rally leader Acep Sofyan said. Attacks against Ahmadiyah first began in 1992 and became more frequent after the 2005 law on blasphemy was enacted. Many blame the government for not cracking down on the perpetrators of the attacks. Acep accused the government of intentionally stalling a decision on whether Ahmadiyah should be forced to stop claiming it was an Islamic group and to not provoke Islamic organizations. “Based on the joint ministerial decree passed in 2009, the government should disband Ahmadiyah. But they still exist,” he said. He said the FPI would destroy all Ahmadiyah property in Tasikmalaya — which is about 60 kilometers east of West Java’s capital city, Bandung — if the council did not ban Ahmadiyah within 24 hours. “We promise to bring more people and... don’t prevent us from carrying out our actions,” Acep said. Ahmadiyah coordinator Encang Zarkasih blamed their prosecution on misinterpretations of the joint ministerial decree. “The decree is being misconceived as a vehicle to disband Ahmadiyah. The decree only tells us not to worship openly. We still have the right to perform religious worship — that is stipulated in the decree,” he said. Encang said that the local Ahmadiyah community trusted the police and military to protect the 600 Ahmadis in Tasikmalaya . Security around Ahmadi-owned properties in the area has been heightened following the Ciekusik massacre in Banten province, in which three Ahmadis were killed by a mob. In December two Ahmadis were killed in Tasikmalaya by a mob who claimed the joint ministerial decree had disbanded Ahamadiyah. “We are resigned to accept whatever will happen,” Encang said. The Cikeusik incident has terrified Ahamadiyah communities throughout the country. In Palembang, South Sumatra, home to 1,000 Ahmadis, local leader Basuki Ahmad appealed to the security forces to protect his community. “We are here only doing religious worship, saying prayers and attending learning forums. We never preach because that would violate the decree,” he said. In Malang, East Java, Ahmadiyah followers were urged to abandon their houses of worship and pray in mainstream mosques. This was a way for Ahmadiyah communityto still practise their religion, Faishal Haq, a lecturer at the Surabaya’s Sunan Ampel Institute of Islamic Studies, said. “I think there is no differences between religious practices. They also perform prayers five times a day.” He said religious differences should be settled within the Islamic community. “Islam is the religion that gives peace to mankind. Why should there be violence?” he said. — Khairul Saleh contributed to the reports from Palembang",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/02/10/hardliners-vow-attack-ahmadiyah-tasikmalaya.html,,2011
"Thu, February 10 2011",SBY seeks action against extremists,"Where were you Tuesday?: Members of the Police’s elite force Mobile Brigade guard a church in Temanggung, Central Java, on Wednesday. Three churches and the local court building were attacked by mobs dissatisfied with a five-year prison term handed down to a blasphemy defendant on Tuesday. Antara/Anis Efizudin In the wake of the killing of three Ahmadis in Banten and the attack on three churches in Central Java on Wednesday the President called for the disbandment of mass organizations that have often incited violence and acted as hate-mongers. The statement came in response to a recent attack on Ahmadis in Cikeusik village, Banten, which killed three of the group’s followers, and mobs vandalizing three churches in Temanggung, Central Java. “If there are groups or organizations continuing to perform acts of violence, law enforcers should seek legal ways, if necessary, to disband [them],” President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said as quoted by Antara in a speech at the commemoration of the 2011 National Press Day in Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara, on Wednesday. “We will not tolerate hatespeech or calls on certain communities to commit violence, including murder,” he said. The President stopped short of naming any groups, though many believed he was possibly referring to the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), a local hard-line group known for its violent raids on nightclubs and animosity toward anything blasphemous against Islam. Yudhoyono also instructed all heads of regional administrations, military personnel and police to take steps to detect, prevent and punish those responsible for acts that cross the boundaries of decency. “In this country, there are no villages or sub-districts without leaders or security officers.” Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi said that thus far there had been no mass organizations found to have disturbed public order that would need to be disbanded. He added that an organization could be disbanded if they were thought to have disturbed public order and received foreign aid that induced them to provoke unrest. “That is what we are looking into. We need to act based on facts,” he said. Law and Human Rights Minister Patrialis Akbar said disbanding the organizations would not be an easy task, because not all of them were officially registered. Interfaith group Setara Institute put its support behind President Yudhoyono’s call for disbanding “violent groups causing unrest among the communities”. The NGO said in a press statement it appreciated “the President’s plan and moves to study and explore possibilities of dissolving certain groups”. The Central Java Police said on Wednesday they had named eight suspects in the Temanggung incident, identifying them as M.H.Y., S.D., H.S., N.Y., S.F., A.K. and S.M. Central Java Police chief Insp. Gen. Edward Aritonang told The Jakarta Post that M.H.Y. was detained on Tuesday, while the others were on Wednesday. He said the suspects were charged with involvement in preparing to instigate riots and attacks, adding that the police confiscated several pieces of evidence. “One [piece of evidence] is a police shield they took.” He declined to say which organizations the suspects were from, only saying they were from Temanggung and the surrounding areas. National Police chief Gen. Timur Pradopo had earlier said mob attacks  did not involve local residents. The attackers, who were standing outside Temanggung District Court to hear the verdict of Antonius Richmon Bawengan, on trial for blasphemy, were not from Temanggung, he added. The FPI denied allegations it was behind the Temanggung attacks. “Our organization has one command system, and there was no order to go [to Temanggung],” FPI Central Java-Yogyakarta branch chief Bambang Tedi said on Wednesday as quoted by tempointeraktif.com. Setara suggests that law enforcers question leaders of such organizations, which it describes as “supporters of intolerant ideas actively committing violence”. It also says the President can dissolve such organizations using an article in the 1985 Law on NGOs as legal basis. Setara said the President could use the law by collecting evidence presented in trials of perpetrators of violent acts who were found guilty and linked to such organizations. Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali told the lawmakers at a hearing on Wednesday that a joint ministerial decree on Ahmadiyah was meant to protect its followers from persecution, though critics said the decree was used as an excuse to persecute the group.

"Fri, February 11 2011",Police move to ban violent organizations,"The National Police said Thursday it had compiles a list of those often engaged in acts of violence in response to the President’s call to disband violent mass organizations. National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Anton Bahrul Alam said police would take stern measures against the organizations if they were proven to have broken the law. “There are mass organizations that have often broken the law and we will surely take strong actions against them,” he said. Anton, however, did not identify the organizations. The call to disband mass organizations that often incite violence and spread hate speech has recently gained ground with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono instructing law enforcement institutions to seek legal ways of doing so. Yudhoyono’s statement comes in the wake of the killing of three Ahmadis in an attack in Cikeusik village, Banten, last week and an attack on three churches in Temanggung, Central Java, earlier this week. Hard-line Islamic groups are believed to have played the main role in instigating and executing the two attacks. Under the 1985 Mass Organizations Law, an organization could be disbanded if its activities disturbed public order and security. A 1986 government regulation states that the authority to dissolve mass organizations lay with the central or provincial governments, or the municipalities. Before disbanding a mass organization, the government must first issue a letter to the organization’s board requesting it to comply with the law. If after three months the organization fails to do so, the government would then freeze the organization. Home Ministry spokesman Reydonnyzar Moenoek told The Jakarta Post that the government must seek the views of the Supreme Court before disbanding a mass organization at a national level. “It is important to remember that disbanding a mass organization requires legal evidence to prove there have been violations of the law. This evidence should be made available by the police,” he said, adding that disbanding an organization did not automatically outlaw it. He added that the FPI was registered with the ministry and that the ministry had issued a letter warning the FPI board against disrupting public order after a 2008 clash with pluralism activists. Public pressure mounted for the FPI to be disbanded after the incident. “The FPI was very cooperative at the time. They respected our warning,” Reydonnyzar told the Post, adding that a further inquiry showed that the FPI had not instructed  the 2008 attack on the activists. “The attack was instigated by individuals,” he said. “We have to be able to differentiate between acts done by individuals and instigated by the organization’s board.” Calls for the disbandment of the FPI have reappeared with some people showing their support of Yudhoyono’s stance on the Internet. “Dissolve all mass organizations and the FPI if they only know how to destroy and murder,” a user posted on Twitter. But the FPI issued a sharp retort to Yudhoyono’s statement, warning it would overthrow Yudhoyono if he dared to disband any mass organization, including the FPI. “Yudhoyono will become like Ben Ali of Tunisia. Indonesia will be like Egypt. We will topple SBY because he has diverted [attention away from] the [Ahmadiyah] issue,” FPI militia commander Munarman told news portal tempointeraktif.com.

Indonesia will be like Egypt. We will topple SBY because he has diverted [attention from] the [Ahmadiyah] issue,” FPI militia commander Munarman said Thursday, as quoted by tempointeraktif.com. Munarman made the statement in response to Yudhoyono’s calls for the disbanding of any violent mass organizations following a barbaric attack on an Ahmadiyah congregation in Cikeusik, Banten, which led to the deaths of three Ahmadis. He said Yudhoyono had made a mistake because the Cikeusik incident, as well as the burning of three churches in Temanggung, Central Java, on Tuesday, had not involved any mass organizations. Your comments: The FPI should also be aware that thousands of Indonesians will go out onto the streets just like in Egypt to demand the FPI be disbanded.

This clearly is treason. It’s been a long time coming but at last the FPI has given him a clear and direct reason to act. Let the dice roll. Duncan Jakarta I think disbanding the FPI won’t solve any problems because the FPI is only the cloth. Both people and the spirit are the same.

"Fri, February 18 2011","Govt claims attacks too random, lacks evidence linking groups","Probes into a string of violent attacks against religious groups in the past two weeks have yet to conclude anything, averting actions to bar any mass organizations. Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Djoko Suyanto said evidence from the rampages in Cikeusik, Banten; Temanggung, Central Java; and Pasuruan, East Java, lacks any pattern that could implicate certain groups or actors. “The three cases are very different. They are not linked to each other,” he said after meeting the respective governors in Semarang, Central Java, on Friday. The minister argued that the attacks against the Islamic boarding school in Pasuruan were not new. “Such attacks [by one group against another] have happened several times before [in Pasuruan],” he said without elaborating on the group attacking the school. Three consecutive attacks against religious groups occurred in the last two weeks, continuing a history of violence against such groups in the past two years. Various groups have collected evidence, indicating that there were certain patterns in the cases and that they might have been orchestrated. In the Cikeusik rampage that killed three Ahmadis, video recordings indicated the attack had been planned and organized, including the fact that the attackers wore blue ribbons to differentiate themselves from the Ahmadis. The indicators have pointed to Muslim hard-liners in the country. The National Police detained a Muslim cleric, identified only with the initial U, as a suspect in the Cikeusik tragedy, and arrested six suspects linked to the Pasuruan case. Islamic extremist groups have been involved in various attacks against minorities in the past two years, some of which were bloody or even fatal. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s administration has only acted against individuals who were caught on site perpetrating the violent acts, but has taken no action on the hard-line groups because, as a democracy, the state protects the existence of such mass organizations. Critics said the government’s slow response in taking stern actions against the groups has caused those behind the actions to becoming more random and difficult to identify. Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi, who was also at the Semarang meeting, said the government had not found evidence of the mass organizations breaching the law, including the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI). “We have procedures to disband mass organizations; we are still studying it while seeking evidence from the police,” he said in Semarang. Gamawan referred to the 1985 Law on Mass Organizations. Minister Gamawan met leaders of the FPI and the Islamic People’s Forum (FUI) to hear their suggestions on what to do about the minority sect Ahmadiyah. The speculation that the recent incidents had religious motives were also challenged. Rector of Surabaya-based Sunan Ampel Islamic State University Nur Syam said the attack in Pasuruan’s Islamic boarding school was not prompted by religious differences. “Unlike in Pandeglang and Temanggung, there was no religious issue in the school attack in Pasuruan. It was part of old animosity between different groups in Pasuruan,” Nur Syam said as quoted by Antara. Departing Governor of the National Resilience Institute (Lemhannas) Muladi said the government could not disband mass organization using the 1985 law because it would violate human rights principles.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/02/18/govt-claims-attacks-too-random-lacks-evidence-linking-groups.html,,2011
"Sat, February 19 2011",Ahmadiyah refuses to be named new religion,"As Ahmadis turned down a proposal that would declare them to be non-Muslims, hard-line groups ratcheted up their campaign in calling for the disbandment of the sect. Responding to a proposal from the government and politicians that Ahmadiyah should be declared a new religion, Ahmadiyah spokesman Zafrullah Pontoh said it would be almost impossible for them to accept the proposal and they would continue to regard themselves as Muslims. “Religion belongs to God. We don’t have the courage to deal with God if we have to build a new religion,” Zafrullah told The Jakarta Post. Law and Human Rights Minister Patrialis Akbar said the government would discuss the possibility of requiring the Ahmadis to declare themselves to be non-Muslims. The chairman of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s Democratic Party, Anas Urbaningrum, said that if the government could clarify the status of Ahmadiyah by declaring it a new religion, it would create a more positive perspective toward the sect. “If we declare Ahmadiyah a ‘religion of Ahmadiyah’ and not Islam, then people would apply the principle of lakum dinukum waliyadin [to you your religion and to me mine]. It would create mutual respect.” The new stance from Ahmadis will likely embolden radical groups which had called for the banning of the sect. One of the staunchest supporters of the ban against Ahmadiyah, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) took to the streets on Friday, giving an ultimatum to the government to disband the sect before March 1. Joined by other Muslim groups including the Association of Islamic Students (HMI), FPI members rallied on the city’s main thoroughfares, repeating their previous demands. “Either the government bans Ahmadiyah or we will wage a revolution,” said a group spokesman at the rally, Bernard Abdul Jabbar. One of activists at the rally, Nurdiati Akma from the Koran Reciting Group (Forsap), called for the swift disbandment of Ahmadiyah, as its teachings had compromised the purity of Islam. “Therefore, it is halal [allowed] for us to spill the blood of Ahmadis,” said Nurdiati, who is also a high-ranking politician from the National Mandate Party (PAN). Her call for spilling the blood of Ahmadis was quickly greeted with the chant, “Allahu Akbar [God is great],” from the crowd. Meanwhile, in Makassar, South Sulawesi, FPI chairman Habib Rizieq swore that he would fight for the banning of Ahmadiyah until the very end. “In the name of God, until the very last drop of my blood, I, along with my colleagues from other Islamic organizations, will continue fighting for the disbanding of Ahmadiyah in Indonesia. We will face any risk,” Rizieq said. Responding to the mass rally from the hard-line group, coordinator for the Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence (KontraS) Usman Hamid said it was time for Yudhoyono to take a bolder stance against civilian organizations advocating violence and bent on rebelling against the country’s legitimate government. “If these mass organizations are allowed to spread their violent ideas freely, then it will further threaten the nation’s constitutional integrity and pluralism,” Usman said. Some in Yudhoyono’s inner circle, however, said that the government needed to express prudence when dealing with hard-line groups. A member of Yudhoyono’s Democratic Party central board, Rachland Nashidik, said there was no need yet for the police to arrest the leaders of hard-line groups.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/02/19/ahmadiyah-refuses-be-named-new-religion.html,,2011
"Wed, February 23 2011",Viewpoint: Handbag heroes and the President,"The saying “Wham, bam, thank you Ma’am” had a different meaning for me until I came across a video of Ann Timson, a 71-year-old pensioner in Northampton (UK), taking on six men twice her size (http://video.perthnow.com.au/1784997849/UK-woman-beats-robbers-with-handbag?area=videoindex16). The fearless granny saw they were engaged in a brazen smash-and-grab robbery of a jewelry shop, in a main street, in broad daylight. Furious that no one was doing anything about it, she ran across and started clobbering the burglars with her handbag. Stunned and astonished, one of them ran away immediately, but the others kept bashing the windows, grabbing jewelry and expensive watches. One of them threatened Timson with a sledgehammer, but she kept hitting him, undaunted, until passers-by joined in. Eventually the police caught four of the suspects, and are still hunting the other two. Hailed as a hero, Granny Timson said she didn’t feel she was a hero at all. She simply had to do something, she said, because no one else was. It all sounds a bit like Indonesia to me, where no one does anything about violent crimes committed in public, in broad daylight by religious vigilantes. In fact, I’m starting to wonder if we should all club together and buy President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) a nice big handbag? Who knows, maybe such an accoutrement could give him the courage boost he so desperately needs. After all, Margaret Thatcher was also a handbag hero. She was poster girl of the handbag brigade in fact, and never left home without one. Prime minister of Britain for almost 12 years, she did controversial and unpopular but undeniably brave things for her country. A Conservative minister once remarked that she had  “the authority of her office always with her. It was in her handbag …” If not a handbag, SBY certainly needs something to ward off the accusations that he — and the state — are behaving in a cowardly way by allowing increasingly violent attacks to continue against Ahmadis, Christians and other religious minorities. Yes, Indonesia has always had religious conflict, and it has always tested the authority of the state. Unfortunately, however, the Cikeusik tragedy, which claimed three lives, looks like a test this government probably won’t pass. The reason? Deep down, the government probably doesn’t think the attacks are wrong, even though the FPI (Islam Defenders Front) is threatening to topple SBY if he dares to disband any mass organization, including them. It is hard to avoid the suspicion that for our government the real criminals are not the attackers, but the Ahmadis, because they dare to be different. Of course, in a democracy that respects human rights, being different is what it’s all about. It’s called pluralism, duh! It means the smallest, weirdest religious group has the right to exist, and that right should be defended. SBY should check out Articles 28E and 29 of our newly-amended Constitution, and get the backbone to do what it says there: Guarantee freedom of belief. Remember the brouhaha about the so-called “Ground Zero Mosque” in New York? President Barack Obama repeatedly spoke out in defense of Muslims’ right to build what was, in fact, a community center. It was a politically high-risk position to take, and Obama could have lost much credibility in the eyes of many Americans (and not just Pastor “Koran burning” Jones). And yet Obama took that risk. Why? Because the notion of human rights runs in his blood. Not so SBY. His mindset comes from the New Order militaristic mentality that prioritizes stability above everything else. You can take the general out of the New Order (and even make him President in the Reform Era), but you can’t take the New Order out of the general. Once a general, always a general — and that, sadly, is our Pak Beye. In 2007 I wrote a column about Indonesia being a gangster state (“Den of Thieves, Republic of Gangsters”, www.juliasuryakusuma.com/column.php?menu_=2&year=2007&month=5&column_id=145). State-sanctioned violence is a classic manifestation of this gangster state, and has its origins in the “Integralistic” 1945 Constitution. Before it was amended, that Constitution granted authoritarian and arbitrary rights to the state, allowing governments to rule unchecked. SBY must have forgotten we amended it to guarantee human rights — including freedom of belief. While extreme or radical organizations like the FPI will always exist, even in democratic countries (like the far-right Ku Klux Klan in the US), the majority of Indonesian civil society believes in pluralism. It’s our state institutions that need to catch up. The problem is that there is still is no public culture of rights yet in Indonesia. The laws exist, but not the mentality. So is there hope for us? Yes, possibly in 2014, if we all vote to kick out outdated has-beens from times gone by, and get a government led by people whose brains were not formed under the New Order. Ann Timson, crime-buster and supergranny, says she and her handbag have been fighting crime for over 10 years. Maybe we should fly her over to Indonesia to teach SBY a trick or two? She was 61 when she started, and SBY is now 62, so he’s only a year behind Britain’s handbag-toting hero if he starts now!

"Thu, February 24 2011",Disbandment undemocratic,"During the commemoration of National Press Day in Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono urged state apparatus to evaluate the presence of mass-organizations involved in acts of violence and, if necessary, to disband them. But this idea is likely to fail not because of a threat from hard-line Muslim group FPI (Islam Defenders Front) to topple the government or the recent meeting between the Home Minister and FPI leader Habib Rizieq, but because it lacks reasonable judgment and risks radicalizing wider groups of believers and escalating riots. Whereas this idea may hurt freedom of expression and freedom of association, the question that may arise next is how persecution, intimidation and violence will come to an end while the same people are still on the streets. Instead of disbanding them, the government should enforce the law and regulate them. There are some arguments regarding this issue. First, most of the mass-organizations involved in the violent acts are community-based organizations. They created their communities long before they formed their organizations. The decision to formalize was simply a strategy to achieve their goals. If formalization is deemed necessary, they will create it. If not, they will go back to their community for further promulgation (dakwah). Following the issuance of a fatwa (religious edict) by Shaikh Muhammad ibn Hadi al-Madkhali of Saudi Arabia, Ja’far Umar Thalib disbanded the Laskar Jihad (LJ), the jihadist group involved in Muslim-Christian conflicts in Ambon, and urged all of his followers to go back to their madrasa and pesantren. On the same day, the LJ headquarters in Yogyakarta was evacuated. Should, for instance, al-Madkhali issue another fatwa that jihad against Ahmadiyah was a must for every Muslim, thousands of its members would be ready to be mobilized and attack the Ahmadis. Second, it is hard to believe that hard-line organizations such as the FPI are single-minded and can be put into one basket. Like moderate Muslim organizations, they vary. A friend of mine working for a foreign NGO in Jakarta told me that some branches of the FPI were involved in anti-corruption and funding for poverty movements. These actions came in response to the rampant corruption in the country. While the FPI in Bekasi, West Java was involved in vandalizing the allegedly illegal Batak Protestant (HKBP) Church, in Pekalongan the FPI was promoting the importance of public knowledge on budgeting. The FPI leader in the Central Java town was enthusiastic to announce he had finished reading the Holy Koran, but he just started reading the budgeting book. These facts must be eye opening for those who viewed the FPI as a violent organization that persecuted minority groups, ransacked the Playboy office, crushed the gay and lesbian film festival or swept the expatriates when global injustice erupted in the Middle East. The point that I want to make is that the FPI is a part of civil society born during the time when the country began to enjoy freedom. Third, freedom of expression should be entwined with another element of democracy: Law enforcement. The road to democracy is long and arduous and we don’t need to romanticize civil society. We don’t take the pill of civil society tonight and wake up the next morning having democracy. Civil society is a bunch of people who have interests. It is therefore obligatory for the state to create regulations to prevent civil society from going astray. At this point, many of us agree that the ability of the state to enforce the law has eroded. Some even dare to say that the state has been absent for too long. The state has been ignorant witnessing violent acts taking place unashamedly in public life. This is the great mistake of our democracy when civic seedlings grow wild and endanger the tree of state. The Tocquevellian idea that civil associations contribute to democratization can only be understood in the framework of a strong state. Fourth, many organizations in Indonesia, be they religious, social, ethnic or political, have militia wings. The origin of this idea stems from the belief that each element of a society should be aware of and responsible for the survival of the nation. While these militia groups were needed during the Indonesian revolution, in the context of new emerging democracy, their existence will threaten the diversity of Indonesia and escalate horizontal conflicts. They can easily be manipulated by the elites. I want to make another point which becomes the lynchpin of my argument that the state should disband all the militia groups and clean up their attributes that might lead to violence. The fact that ordinary citizens are not sanctioned to freely brandish weapons such as daggers and knives in public arenas has created fear among certain groups and apathy and hate among others. These uncivilized gestures should be outlawed and the perpetrators should be punished and put into jail. It is estimated that the total number of mass-organizations in the country are more than 100,000. The Home Ministry is revising regulations on this issue. No matter what it takes, revisions should reemphasize the fundamental principle that each mass-organization should respect the common platform. This common platform refers to the spirit of pluralism that Indonesia is religiously, ethnically, and politically diverse. If this principle is ignored, and business as usual continues, a more horrible, helter-skelter disaster will take place before our eyes.

"Sat, February 26 2011",Issue: Ahmadis should live on isolated island,"Feb. 17, Online A legislator has said Ahmadiyah sect members should be relocated to an uninhabited island to prevent conflicts between them and those who deem the sect heretic. “Indonesia has 17,000 islands, many of which are uninhabited. So why not move them to an island that is not inhabited,” HM Busro from the House of Representatives’ Commission VIII said Thursday as quoted by tribunnews.com. He said during a meeting with Jamaah Ahmadiyah that segregation was needed because conflicts occurred because the Ahmadis lived among other communities. Your comments: I am a Muslim living in America where almost 500 million are Christians. There is no problem here. People do their own businesses. Nobody tells you to go away. Nobody hurts you.

"Wed, March 2 2011",RI seeks to redefine freedom amid rising religious violence,"God have mercy: A group of Ahmadiyah followers in Yogyakarta conduct a prayer on Tuesday after recent bans issued by several regional leaders across the country. The Yogyakarta chapter of Ahmadiyah has halted its public activities. -JP/Slamet Susanto As local administrations move to ban Ahmadiyah, the government is in a dilemma revolving around “liberty versus order” as it responds to calls to disband the notorious Islam Defenders Front, known as the FPI. Following the mob incident that killed three Ahmadis in Banten and the burning of three churches in Central Java last month, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono ordered his ministers to seek legal measures to disband groups frequently involved in acts of violence. Some believed he was likely referring to groups such as the FPI. But the order has proved to be no easy task. The Home Ministry, which is endowed with the authority to outlaw an organization, said the freedom to form a union or organization was guaranteed by the 1945 Constitution. This, ministry spokesman Reydonnyzar Moenek told The Jakarta Post, meant the government was in a dilemma. As of 2010, more than 9,000 mass organizations were registered with the ministry. It has never banned a single one since the issuance of the mass organization law in 1985, which granted it authority. Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi, a politician from President Yudhoyono’s Democratic Party, denied he had ignored the President’s order, saying he was only cautious not to use the authority recklessly in fear of violating the Constitution. “We are now studying the facts of the incidents,” he claimed. The minister argued that the procedures to disband mass organizations under the existing regulation were complex. “The 1985 Mass Organization Law is too old and is no longer relevant to the country’s current situation,” he said, adding that his ministry was finalizing the revision draft of the law, which will be submitted to the House of Representatives for deliberation this year. A 1986 government regulation outlining the ministry’s authority to disband mass organizations stipulates the government at central and regional levels can freeze a mass organization that disrupts national security and public order, receives foreign aid without the central government’s permission and helps foreign parties that jeopardize national interests. The regulation also stipulates that the ministry ask for considerations from the Supreme Court on whether a certain group be frozen. A frozen organization shall be disbanded if found to continue the illicit acts for three months after receiving warning letters from the government. Despite its violent acts over the past few years, the ministry said it had not yet found evidence that the FPI had broken the 1985 law. While legal matters are hindering the government from taking stern action against the militant group, local administrations are facing no difficulties in finding reasons to ban Ahmadiyah, a minority group deemed heretical by the country’s mainstream Muslims. Last week, Samarinda Mayor Syaharie Jaang in East Kalimantan froze the local chapter of Ahmadiyah after dozens of FPI members rallied in front of his office a few days earlier. The hardline group gave Syaharie a week’s deadline to disband the local chapter of the Islamic sect, saying if it failed to do so it would do it themselves. The mayor reportedly granted the FPI’s demand because he considered Ahmadiyah “a time-bomb that could trigger violence”. In another instance, East Java Governor Soekarwo issued a decree banning Ahmadis from conducting any kind of activity on Monday, only days after 32 Islamic organizations announced a plan to carry out a mass rally in the provincial capital of Surabaya to demand the administration outlaw Ahmadiyah in the province. Activists have questioned whether democracy is the actual reason behind the government’s reluctance to disband the FPI. Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI) chairwoman Erna Ratnaningsih said Timur had a long history of hobnobbing with hardliners since he was West Java Police chief in 2008. Along with Jakarta Governor Fauzi Bowo, Timur attended the FPI’s 12th anniversary celebration at the organization’s headquarters in Jakarta, she said. Last month, she added, Gamawan also met with FPI leader Rizieq Shihab to seek advice over Ahmadiyah. But disbanding mass organizations, some have argued, might not be the answer to end religious violence. Imam Prasodjo, a sociologist from the University of Indonesia, for instance, said violent acts were also caused by cultural aspects that were difficult to manage. “Disbandment of those groups will not automatically reduce violence. Group members will continue [committing violence] as long as cultural problems exist,” he said referring to the stigma against Ahmadiyah.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/03/02/ri-seeks-redefine-freedom-amid-rising-religious-violence.html,,2011
"Fri, March 4 2011",Issue: AGO supports local bans on Ahmadiyah,"March 2, Online The Attorney General’s Office (AGO) has supported the issuance of several bylaws that ban Ahmadiyah activities. “Of course we support [the regional administrations’ acts] because they are the ones who own their territories, and that’s their stance, so why not support them?” Attorney General Basrief Arief said on Wednesday as quoted by Antara news agency. Several regional administrations have issued bylaws that ban Ahmadis from religious activities following a bloody attack on followers of the minority religious group in Pandeglang, Banten, last month. Basrief said the administrations’ decision to issue the bylaws must have been based on their comprehension of the regions’ social condition and to keep public order. If Ahmadiyah is considered to be inciting violence and disrupting public order, “it is the regional administration’s authority [to ban Ahmadiyah],” he added. Your comments: This is not a constitutional law — pure discriminatory religious based politics. So presumably the AGO will support similar bylaws to ban FPI activities? And any other religious based group that tries to protect their human rights. Isn’t this bizarre — just weeks after a Muslim group of terrorists attack and kill Ahmadiyah people in a private house, the AGO supports bylaws that will limit the activities of Ahmadiyah?

East Java Governor Soekarwo on Monday issued a four-point decree that ordered Ahmadiyah to cease all proselytization, banned the use of its name in public places, demanded all signboards bearing the Ahmadiyah name on mosques and schools be dismantled and banned the use of its name on any forms of identification. Falling short of outlawing Ahmadiyah entirely, Soekarwo said the decree was issued in the name of public security and order, something which he claimed as governor he was empowered to do. It is easy to see where all this is going. What they cannot achieve nationally, they do first locally. One is immediately reminded of Mao Zedong’s guerrilla warfare tactic of launching a campaign in an area and having it spread until it surrounded the city. This is happening in Indonesia faster than many thought. On Tuesday, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) launched a massive demonstration in Jakarta demanding that the city administration follow suit in banning Ahmadiyah. The Indonesian Ulema Council, supposedly the umbrella organization for all Islamic organizations in the country, has led the campaign to have Ahmadiyah completely outlawed in Indonesia. While Ahmadiyah believes in most of the tenets and principles of Islam, it recognizes its founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as a prophet, in contravention to the belief of mainstream Sunni Muslims that Muhammad was the last prophet. The campaign had been waged in the streets by the FPI, which has coordinated or supported some of the violent attacks on Ahmadiyah followers and their property in recent years. There are more than 200,000 members of Ahmadiyah throughout Indonesia, and as they tend to live in housing complexes they became easy prey. Last month, three Ahmadis were killed in a mob attack at one of their homes in Cikeusik, Banten. The incident, and another mob attack on churches two days later in the Central Java town of Temanggung, prompted President Yudhoyono to order his government and the police to ban organizations that use violence and spread hate. But, his demands only emboldened the FPI even more as they then threatened to bring down the government. NU, Indonesia’s largest Islamic organization, threw its weight on Monday behind the campaign to have Ahmadiyah outlawed. Making the call in a speech in Sampang, East Java, NU chair Said Aqil Siradj described Ahmadiyah as “clearly deviant” and said the group should therefore be banned. The central government has so far resisted the mounting pressures to issue an outright ban on Ahmadiyah. It issued a vaguely worded decree in 2008 ordering Ahmadiyah to stop all activities deemed counter to Islam, which is the dominant religion in the country. The FPI saw this as not far-reaching enough and has continued with its violent campaigns. The Ahmadiyah case has put Yudhoyono in a difficult predicament. As President, his oath of office obliges him to uphold the constitution, which includes guarantees of freedom of religion and protection for people of all faiths. But, he cannot ignore public opinion either. While the government, or the courts for that matter, cannot make judgments about the substance of a religion, it can rule to ban an organization on the grounds of public order and security. Other suggestions floated to break the impasse include ordering Ahmadiyah to stop all claims to being part of Islam or to term it a new religion apart from Islam. But, calls to ban or outlaw the group appear to be growing stronger and anything less is not likely to stop the ongoing campaign. An outright ban on Ahmadiyah raises the larger question about the state of freedom of religion in Indonesia, and more particularly the government’s ability to guarantee that freedom and to protect the rights of religious minorities to practice their faith. Christians and Catholics, the largest religious minorities in the country, have also seen their churches being targeted by violent FPI campaigns in recent years. If Ahmadiyah is banned, no religious minority is safe in Indonesia. Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta and the rest of the nation’s founding fathers must be turning in their graves seeing the republic they fought to create with their blood, sweat and tears — that was open to all religions — now being torn apart by religious difference.

The Party will lose its selling points and so much time will be wasted. The remaining three-and-a-half years of SBY’s government will not do much to improve the public’s welfare.

Pikintoro Jakarta It seems the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) will be ousted from the ruling coalition and the position will be offered to the Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra). But because Indonesia follows the presidential system, not parliamentary, I think it is better if the President also ousts the Golkar Party from the ruling coalition. President SBY must dare to reshuffle his Cabinet and name new professional ministers, particularly for strategic positions such as the Industry Ministry, Agriculture Ministry, Research and Technology Ministry as well as the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry.

"Fri, March 11 2011",Jambi allows Ahmadiyah to perform religious activities,"When faced with the option on whether to ban Ahmadiyah, the Jambi provincial administration has chosen not to, while in East Java calls to support bans continue. Jambi Deputy Governor Fachrori Umar said his administration allowed Ahmadiyah followers to perform religious activities freely across the province. “We will not follow other regional administration heads who issued bans on Ahmadiyah activities. They are free,” Fachrori was quoted as saying by Antara in Jambi on Thursday. The administration is left with the obligation to supervise Ahmadiyah’s activities, he added. The decision not to issue a bylaw to ban Ahmadiyah was made on the grounds that the province did not have a problem with the matter. The administration, he said, would follow the central government’s directions and not issue a one-sided policy over fears it would instead incite conflict. “The supervision we have been giving so far shows a promising result as indicated by the fact that no rifts have occurred in Jambi. The development of the sect has also been small as there are no new Ahmadiyah members here,” he said. He said supervision would be conducted, among others, through religious preaching. But instead of providing supervision, a number of other regional administrations said they preferred to issue policies to ban Ahmadiyah in their respective regions. East Java Governor Soekarwo on Feb. 28 imposed the ban, which was supported both legislative and executive institutions, religious leaders and the Indonesian Ulema Council’s (MUI) provincial branch. The Ahmadiyah community has been banned from spreading their teachings and has been ordered to dismantle the sect’s signs and attributes. West Java and South Sumatra have also implemented the same policy but Yogyakarta has opted against it. Separately in Riau, Governor Rusli Zainal said his administration had yet to decide on whether to issue a bylaw for the same purpose considering that the Ahmadiyah community had been in the province for a long time, especially in Pekanbaru, the provincial capital. He said there were at least three locations in Pekanbaru that had been centers of Ahmadiyah activities in the region. In Surabaya, thousands of Muslims from 36 mass organizations staged a rally Thursday in front of the Grahadi building in support of the ban. Calling itself the United Muslim Community Movement (GUIB), the group urged Governor Soekarwo not to void the 2011 governor decree on the ban. “The FPI [Islamic Defenders Front] will always guard the decree. Together with GUIB we are ready to defend the governor should there be someone or some group wanting the cancellation of the decree,” FPI East Java chairman Habib Haidar Al Hamid said in his oratory at the rally. He added that the FPI was also ready to protect and guarantee the security of the governor both while in his office or at home. — Wahyoe Boediwardhana contributed to the reports from Surabaya",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/03/11/jambi-allows-ahmadiyah-perform-religious-activities.html,,2011
"Sat, March 12 2011",Does SBY have the guts to ban violent groups?,"It looked like there would be a showdown when President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono promised to ban violent organizations and the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) — the obvious intended target — retorted that it would start a revolution if the President failed to meet their demands that Ahmadiyah be dissolved by March 1. The timing of the war of words has never been more critical, occurring only a few days after violent hard-line Muslims stormed an Ahmadi residence in Cikeusik, Banten, and killed three people and others attacked three churches in Temanggung, Central Java. But, as of today, the President has yet to do anything to make good on his promise, which received mixed reactions from the weary public. It could be just another bluff given that he has made the same threat at least three times since 2006. But, the FPI has not done anything yet either, apart from a small street demonstration it jointly organized with other radical Muslim groups like the Muslims Forum and Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia in Jakarta late last month. In numerous interviews with the media, FPI leaders promised to topple President Yudhoyono should he refuse to ban Ahmadiyah, the way the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia thrashed the authoritarian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. In fact, the whole affair has only revealed how weak Yudhoyono’s government is. When addressing the National Press Day celebration on Feb. 9, SBY ordered his aides to ban violent organizations. But, none of his most authoritative aides: Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi, Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali, Attorney General Basrif Arief and National Police chief Gen. Timur Pradopo seemed to heed his orders. Instead, Gamawan hosted a meeting with top leaders of the notorious FPI at his office on Feb. 16, exactly a week after Yudhoyono made his threat. Smiling broadly, Gamawan told waiting journalists that he and FPI leaders Habib Rizieq and Munarman exchanged opinions on how deal with Ahmadiyah. Meanwhile, Suryadharma has been busy blaming the Ahmadis for the Cikeusik tragedy and wanting to ban Ahmadiyah entirely. Even more mind boggling, the Attorney General’s Office spokesperson Marwan Effendi lauded local governments that caved in to radical demands and banned Ahmadiyah in their areas. Yudhoyono has not made any comments on these glaring insubordinations. What has happened is that more regencies and cities are toying with the idea of banning Ahmadiyah in the name of regional autonomy. Gamawan, like Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali, is known for his anti-Ahmadiyah stance. Along with then attorney general Hendarman Supandji, they issued a joint decree banning Ahmadis from conducting religious activities outside their community. When Gamawan was the governor of West Sumatra, he was one of the regional heads who introduced the controversial sharia-inspired morality bylaws. Ahmadiyah followers have suffered from discrimination and physical attacks since the Indonesian Ulema Council called the cult heretical in a 1980 fatwa and reaffirmed it in 2005. For hard-liners, the controversial decree has become a license to bully Ahmadis with the tacit support of the local police and government bureaucrats. They vow there will be no peace until Yudhoyono formally bans Ahmadiyah, which they consider heretical because it does not recognize the Islamic orthodoxy that Muhammad is the last prophet. Interestingly, while Yudhoyono has yet to prove he was not bluffing, such provinces as Banten, East Java, West Java, Lampung and South Kalimantan have boldly announced that they have banned Ahmadiyah. This is a worrying development that can give way to more cases of violence against Ahmadis, whose numbers are estimated at 200,000, living in enclaves across the archipelago. Yudhoyono’s inaction in banning violent vigilante groups as he promised to do has given added credence to the perception that he is afraid of the small but noisy hard-line groups. It has also left many wondering if violent radicals are enjoying the backing of some extremely powerful but corrupt individuals in the police, military, political parties or interest groups who are using terror for their personal or institutional interests. Yudhoyono has mishandled the FPI’s threat to topple him like the Tunisians did with their despot. He was ridiculed when his spokesperson Julian A. Pasha promised to take measures against the FPI. His critics argue that the President should have ignored the FPI threat because the group is just too small to make an impact politically, because moderate majority Muslims do not share its brand of Islam. His overreaction has made it as if the FPI were so important that mainstream politics has to reckon with it. Political analyst Hermawan Sulistyo says the FPI, which has only a few thousand members, has no financial and human resources to mobilize the masses for a revolution as it brags that it has. To start a revolution it would need at least 100,000 people militant enough to demonstrate for at least four weeks, which would also require a lot of money, he says. Hermawan may be right. The gargantuan anti-Yudhoyono demonstrations that the FPI promised have not manifested. And, Yudhoyono seems to have forgotten his threat as well, for pressing new issues keep arising. This whole political comedy should not distract Yudhoyono from the real issue: protecting minorities and punishing people who break the law, not banning organizations, as the right to organize is guaranteed by the Constitution.

SBY is forever sitting on the fence, postponing important decisions until he himself has forgotten about it. He lacks the guts to tackle important problems that have been festering for so long. He sends his aides to ban violent organizations such as the FPI, but his aides have their own agendas that are totally opposed to the instructions of SBY. Instead of banning violent organizations, Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi, Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali, Attorney General Basrif Arief and National Police Chief Gen. Timur Pradopo have all ignored his orders. Gamawan instead hosted a meeting with top leaders of the FPI on Feb. 16, a week after SBY issued his orders. Attorney General spokesperson Marwan Effendi even lauded local governments that have banned Ahmadiyah in Banten, East Java, West Java, Lampung and South Kalimantan. I sincerely applaud the regional governments of Jambi, Lombok, Bali and DKI who have stated that they do not ban Ahmadis. However, the recent developments in a number of provinces that have totally banned Ahmadis is worrying. SBY only thinks of his own reputation. He wants to be friends with everybody. If problems arise, he is always blaming other parties for failed policies. If he runs out of black sheep, he  blames the weather.

"Thu, March 17 2011","We will not be silenced by terror, say liberal Muslims","The country’s liberal Muslims said Wednesday they were not deterred by the renewed threat of terror after a liberal Muslim activist was mailed a bomb disguised in a book. Liberal Islam Network (JIL) co-founder Luthfi Assyaukanie said that the terror attack allegedly targeting his colleague Ulil Abshar Abdalla was an attack on freedom. He dismissed Ulil’s suggestion Tuesday that the attack was politically motivated and linked to his role as a Democratic Party politician. “This is more than just a threat to the Liberal Islam Network. This is a threat to our pluralistic society,” Luthfi told The Jakarta Post on Wednesday. A bomb packed in a book titled Mereka Harus Dibunuh Karena Dosa-Dosa Mereka Terhadap Islam dan Muslimin (They Must Be Killed for Their Sins against Islam and Muslims) was sent on Tuesday to JIL’s headquarters in Utan Kayu, East Jakarta. JIL was co-founded by Ulil. The bomb exploded while being defused, injuring three police officers. Ulil, who never actually received the book, was uninjured. Luthfi said it would be naive to believe the botched attack against Ulil was political. “This is an attack against liberal Islam. And this was not the first time JIL has been intimidated like this,” he said. In 2003, hard-liners from the Islamic Community Brotherhood Forum (FUUI) declared Ulil’s blood halal, meaning that it was okay to kill him. A suspected terrorist, Abdullah Sunata, ordered Iqbal Husaini to shoot and kill Ulil in 2004. In 2005, hard-liners from the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) reportedly planned to attack JIL’s offices after JIL issued a petition asking the government to protect all citizens’ right to worship and to protect the 200,000 Ahmadis in Indonesia. Noted moderate Muslim scholar Azyumardi Azra from Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University condemned the attack, saying that differences in opinion could not be resolved through violence. “The development of Islamic thought will not be stopped by bomb threats,” he told the Post. Mohamad Guntur Romli, a former JIL member and defender of pluralism, was a victim of a violent ambush by the FPI during a rally promoting religious tolerance in June 2008. He said he would continue to fight for freedom of expression, including religious expression. “Closing the door to interpretations of Islam is a threat to Islam itself because in doing so Islam will decline,” he said. The liberals’ mission is clear. “We defend the rights of minorities, including Ahmadiyah. And we only condemn one group: Those who commit violence,” Guntur said. Some admitted the challenges they faced were now greater than ever. The bomb attack in Utan Kayu came amid rising intolerance in the country towards minority Ahmadis, who some consider heretics. Critics said the state was not only failing to protect Ahmadis but was also complicit in persecuting the group. “Religious intolerance and the radicalization of Islam are getting worse. The government is failing,” Luthfi said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/03/17/we-will-not-be-silenced-terror-say-liberal-muslims.html,,2011
"Mon, March 21 2011",FPI sets its eyes on underground music,"Hot on the heels of its campaign against the dissolution of Ahmadiyah, the hard-line Muslim group Islam Defenders Front (FPI) is now setting its eyes on underground music, which its members believe carry messages that would lead young Muslims astray. In a public lecture at the FPI headquarters in Petamburan, Central Jakarta, senior FPI member and purported Islamic music “expert” Farid Budi Fahri alleged there had been concerted efforts to turn young people away from Islamic teachings through a variety of underground music. “There has been a conspiracy. A war launched by the underground community [against mainstream Islamic teaching],” he told FPI members who came to the talk last week. Farid traced the roots of the underground music to a Zionist movement. He said that a group of people adhering to Zionist ideology has used the medium to conceal their objectives of world domination. “At the end of the day, it will sow conflict among Muslims themselves,” Farid said. He went on to speculate that the underground music community, which initially developed as a resistance towards the mainstream industry by independently producing and distributing music, has been subverted by the Zionist movement to spread ideas that would contradict Islam. “Are these musicians carrying out a Zionist mission? I would say no. The conspiracy is within the music, the lyrics which carry messages and the ideology which would create a lifestyle and counter culture in the end,” Farid said. He cited the lyrics of John Lennon’s song Imagine as Zionist music, although Lennon was not Jewish and was not considered an idol of the underground music community. “People keep singing his songs without realizing the meaning behind it,” he said. He suspected that the song — about a hypothetical state of the world where religion, state and ideology did not exist — carry a pure Zionist message. Farid also said some underground musical outfits had promoted Satanic messages. He said bands like Sepultura, Metallica and Lamb of God were satanic bands that could turn young Muslim fans away from religion. The FPI has thus far tried to extend efforts to reach out to punk communities in the city to spread the message of Islam. “So far we have tried to approach punk communities in Pulo Gadung and Blok M bus terminals so that they can return to the true Islamic teachings,” Farid said. He said FPI would soon expand its anti-underground initiatives. “We expect that we can be done with the Ahmadiyah case soon so that FPI can concentrate on other issues like dealing with heresy that is rampant in the underground community,” Farid said. Responding to the threat, the Jakarta Police said it would look into the matter. “We have not received information about the issue yet,” City Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Baharuddin Jafar said. This is not the first time FPI launched a campaign against creative arts. The Bekasi branch of FPI last year called on the removal of a sculpture design by a Balinese artist titled Tiga Mojang (Three Women), alleging that it was a depiction of the Holy Trinity.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/03/21/fpi-sets-its-eyes-underground-music.html,,2011

The reality is that our constitution allows the freedom to practice freely and without hindrance one’s religion and you and others are withholding that freedom. Please consider the fact that many of our grandparents and parents died to secure that freedom and your actions are at best disrespectful and ignorant and at worst treason. In addition to the constitutionally illegal 2008 decree, you have allowed a significant number of bylaws to be introduced that are quite simply a further violation of human and religious rights. Your rhetoric and that of others such as the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) has lead directly to increases in violence and in at least three instances death. In essence, you have legitimized the persecution of Ahmadiyah, often turning a blind eye to offenses committed against them.

"Fri, April 1 2011",Underground community members aim to bury hatchet,"The underground music community is taking in stride alleged threats from the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) regarding a potential crack down on their activities, saying that bullying would not deter them from doing what they liked best — making music. In a speech last week, an FPI preacher allegedly said FPI members should prepare to initiate a campaign to bring members of the underground music community back into mainstream Islam because they had been perverted by Satanism, Zionism and Liberalism. In a statement published on the group’s website on Thursday, FPI said The Jakarta Post article titled “FPI sets its sights on underground community” published on March 21st, is slanderous and that the organization had no plan to act against underground music. However, in the statement the FPI said that the underground music community had indeed been infiltrated by what it called “Zionist intrigue” and this had prompted some members of the underground music community to rise up against a “Zionist conspiracy”. Some members of the underground community have told the Post about a simmering conflict between Muslim-leaning members of the underground music community and more liberal groups. Members of the liberal grouping, who wished to remain anonymous, talked about intimidation and physical threats made toward them. Those who were willing to talk openly said that there was no conflict to speak of. “Everything is fine with this community,” said Irma from underground group Rotorcorp. The lead singer of legendary metal band Seringai, Arian 13, gave a similar assessment. “All I know is that the underground scene is still alive and kicking.” Other underground members seemed to take the FPI threat lightly. “As long as they do not threaten our existence and the diversity of the community, we will ignore them,” said Doni Herdadu, a.k.a. Doni Iblis, lead singer of underground thrash metal band Funeral Inception. Doni said that the FPI could say anything it wanted about the underground scene, as long as it did not resort to violence. Doni said that the religious underground community, which at times is referred to as “one-fingered metal” started to gain momentum last year when they began to spread Islamic teachings through their music. Members of this grouping aimed their campaign against the so-called “three-fingered metal,” referring to the peace sign used by more liberal underground members. The Muslim metal community rejected the symbolism of three-fingered metal, considering it as a symbol of Illuminati, a secret society believed to be planning a design for a new world order. One finger, on the other hand, is thought to be a symbol for tauheed (monotheism Islam). Doni said that members of the Muslim underground were in fact old friends and colleagues, adding that there is little they could do other than share information and start a campaign to raise awareness so that people would not be easily provoked to attack each other. “I don’t think we are an FPI priority right now. We are probably at the lowest rung in terms of urgent problems they have to deal with,” Doni said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/04/01/underground-community-members-aim-bury-hatchet.html,,2011
"Fri, April 8 2011","The banal rhetoric of imperialism, colonialism","The current campaign waged by the US and its allies against Col. Muammar Qaddafi’s merciless dictatorship also entails a war of ideas. Qaddafi and his followers have shielded themselves from democratic protesters with a predictable and boring rhetoric of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism. Libya will be occupied by the West, just as Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam were occupied! Colonial powers harbor nothing but jealousy of the Third World’s advancing wealth! Oil is at the root of every problem! The rhetoric evokes the bitter experience of the Islamic world under a long period of Western colonialism. It is not surprising that the US and its allies have been branded as crusading armies bent on destroying their Muslim enemies. Conspiracy theorists have already drawn analogies between colonialism and the recent Libya campaign. Some Indonesian politicians have promoted this rhetoric in public. Whether anyone wants to listen is a different issue. Hidayat Nur Wahid, a senior politician of the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), said that the goal of the current war in Libya was “to seize the nation’s oil”, adding that “European countries have suffered from an economic recession. They need new resources to revive their economy.” It sounds like the rhetoric of Iranian president Ahmadinedjad, except in an Indonesian format. Compare Hidayat’s words with those of Ahmadinedjad on the Libyan crisis: “The Westerners have to cast aside their colonialist ambitions.” The rhetoric of imperialism and colonialism can also be found in the case of Ahmadiyah, the minority Islamic sect that has suffered repeated harassment at the hands of Indonesian radicals. According to the hard-liners, the European Union, the UN and US congressmen asked the Indonesian government to pay serious attention to the plight of Ahmadiyah. Many Indonesian officials, rather than heeding their warnings, fired back at perceived international pressure. Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi, for instance, rejected demands to revoke laws that discriminate against the Islamic sect. Gamawan’s response to the US congressmen does not surprise us, as he warmly welcomed the FPI leaders’ proposal to disband the group. You can guess which faction the man sides with. On March 23, I was invited to speak at the Religious Affairs Ministry’s dialogue and public hearing on Ahmadiyah that was held in Central Jakarta. I made myself as clear as possible to other participants that the failure to protect any citizen of Indonesia means the beginning of the nation’s collapse. I reminded the audience about the domino effect. After Ahmadiyah, the Shiite, Christian minority, and liberals, Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah — all groups that are not considered purely “Islamic” by Islamists — will be targeted by the radicals. I realized that most of the participants disagreed with me. Before my turn to speak I listened to members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) — an organization whose fame lies in their radical stances and terrifying tactics — give their threatening opinions. The Religious Affairs Ministry used to be a place where the idea of religious pluralism and other progressive concepts were incubated under the leadership of A. Mukti Ali, Alamsjah Ratuprawiranegara and Munawir Sadzali. Now the ministry has become a rendezvous for the FPI leaders. I am afraid that Ahmadiyah will be disbanded by a more “authoritative” law, enacted after the government’s “consults” with different groups. In fact, nobody is sure that the government listened the sound judgments conveyed by scholars and activists at the seminar. As usual, politicians placed political interests ahead of all other concerns. Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali, who also chairs the United Development Party (PPP), revealed his true colors. At a conference in Samarinda he urged fellow party members not to hesitate to make Islam as an ‘ideology’ (The Jakarta Post, March 27, 2011). He also denounced liberal thinking (The Jakarta Post, Feb. 23, 2011). Indeed, at the ministry’s dialogue I heard a moderator provoke the audience when he said that the US and Western powers were meddling in the case of Ahmadiyah — a form of intervention that we must not bow down to. This rhetoric reminds us the way Abu Bakar Ba’asyir often defends himself in the court. He has repeatedly said that he was arrested under orders from the US. The conspiracy theories then followed: the Indonesian government was a mere toy of the world superpower, the US. I am afraid to draw some points of similarities among the opinions conveyed by Qaddafi, Ahmadinedjad, Hidayat Nur Wahid, the FPI leaders, Ba’asyir, two of the President’s current ministers and perhaps other state officials. I question to what extent radical thinking has penetrated the government. Has this government and other political leaders already knelt down before the FPI’s leaders?

"Fri, April 15 2011","Ahmadiyah a test of dialogue, law","In the wake of attacks against Ahmadis on Feb. 6, 2011, many have called for a dialogue between the members of Ahmadiyah and groups — such as Front Pembela Islam. In other instances, commentators have emphasized the legality of citizens to practice their religion in the manner that they choose. The practice of dialogue and the enforcement of particular laws, however, will not necessarily bring about the easy resolution to conflicts between groups such as FPI and a religious minority such as Ahmadiyah. Dialogues and laws also offer the opportunity for some to further their will upon others. Although a “dialogue” is a welcomed alternative to physical violence, a dialogue is not without its own pitfalls and needs to be judged on its own merits. It is worth questioning, for example, as to who participates in the dialogue and for what ends. A dialogue is not something that can be forced to take place. Dialogues also present an opportunity to perform a kind of discursive violence: a violence, which even if only spoken, still rejects the other participants in the dialogue. In the days after the attacks on Ahmadis in Cikeusik, Banten, some leaders referred to the belief of Ahmadis as being blasphemous of Islam. Elsewhere, in Sabili a conservative (and popular) magazine, Ahmadiyah members are blamed for inciting the violence against them. Moreover, they are referred to as being intolerant of non-Ahmadis. There has been a rush to be considered as “tolerant”, as well as a claim to being “offended”. Discourses regarding religious orthodoxy and deviancy somehow become more important than the criminality of three killings performed in broad daylight. Dialogue, however, might be more useful as a tool to prevent violence, rather than to solve cases or ease tensions after grave violations of one’s rights has already taken place. Since the killings and other attacks, no one has volunteered a statement in which he or she acknowledges a kind of complicity in sharpening attitudes against Ahmadis. Calls for dialogue, thus, become an effort to avoid accountability. Groups that have participated in discursive and physical violence against others, should not participate in public “dialogues” unless they are willing to acknowledge the violence of their actions and words. Ahmadis or others, do not need to validate such calls for dialogues, until those who are guilty have faced public and criminal censure. Some commentators have pointed to the weakness of the state in allowing the killings of Ahmadis. That is, the state has not been able to implement laws that protect Ahmadis (just as it should for any other citizen) from criminal acts of violence. One of the curious elements of recent attacks on Ahmadis, however, is the presence of the state. Throughout the footage that shows the killings in Cikeusik, police are present. They are shown to be passive in watching the killings as they occur. Some publications have continued to report on how different levels of the police force knew about the impending attacks on Suparman’s house in Cikeusik. Here, the state is clearly present: but it is a state that is willing to take sides with an outraged and violent mob. Just as public forums have served to discriminate against Ahmadis, so have the decrees of various governors sought to criminalize belief. These laws are curious as they seemingly go against the laws that are part of the Constitution that state that each citizen is able to hold his or her belief in accordance with their wishes. It seems that these governors, however susceptible they are to different political interests, are willing to give in to the demands of different radical groups. Instead of moving to protect Ahmadis from further discrimination and violent attacks, the state through laws issued at the provincial level have provided more room for discrimination against Ahmadis. Hate-speech is normal when talking about Ahmadiyah. So, the state is present and laws are being created. These laws, however, have followed the demands of “the mob”, rather than referring back to the authority of the Constitution and the state ideology, which states “unity in diversity” and “social justice for all”. The clashes between a self-proclaimed mainstream Muslim majority and that of a minority Muslim sect (Ahmadiyah) are representative of a conflict between “the orthodox” and “un-orthodox”. The orthodox and those who claim to be so, are unwilling to accept those who divert from what is considered to be “the true” or “the real” Islam. This is seen clearly in recent attempts to re-convert Ahmadis away from their chosen faith and back to “the real”, “the right” and “the true” Islam. In such an instance, the orthodox clearly consider themselves to be the paternal representatives who know what is best for the infantile “other” who has strayed from “the straight path”. A negotiation of values was strikingly absent on that morning of Feb. 6, 2011. It was a moment when “dialogue” was no longer possible. It was a moment for violence and rejection of the other. Decrees at the provincial level have further normalized violence against Ahmadis. A dialogue “after the fact” won’t solve anything until the injustices against this particular minority are recognized. It is not the time for a dialogue, but the time for openness and arguments: where people are willing to accept the legitimacy of others to hold their beliefs. Until guilt and culpability is established, a monologue of violence — both physical and discursive — will persist. The writer is based at the Asia Institute, the University of Melbourne, Australia.

"Sun, April 17 2011",Jakarta inundated with proliferating ills,"Already confronted with an absence of clear-cut policies by the Jakarta administration to address poor living conditions, the worsening traffic situation and an overflowing population, the Big Durian also lacks any solution for the uncontrollable prostitution and the growing number of street children. A team of The Jakarta Post’s journalists explored the issue. Here are the stories: Erotic female dancers are up for grabs for any passerby seeking a partner to dance with to dangdut music, while dozens of sex workers — including transvestites — and their pimps roam the vicinity to net customers. A cheap mix of alcoholic drinks, on-the-street massage services and low-quality marijuana and crystal meth are easily available on the spot. Expose These worldly pleasures are available at the Cipinang “one-stop service” evening entertainment spot for low-income Jakartans. Located along a section of Jl. Cipinang in East Jakarta — between the Jatinegara train station and the Cipinang penitentiary — the area is a busy place for street vendors coming from outside Jakarta during the day. But at night, it is a quintessential red light district. Although prostitution is illegal in Indonesia — a country home to the world’s largest Muslim population, several police officers, either on their patrol motorcycles or in cars, could regularly be seen stopping. Reporters witnessed exchanges being made, although the specifics of the transactions were unclear. Cipinang is one example of a new red-light district flourishing in the past five years, indicating a failure by the local administration to at least reduce or control prostitution businesses. Such areas and brothels — operating either openly or camouflaged as massage and spa parlors or beauty centers — can now be found in nearly every corner of Jakarta. Prostitutes can also be easily found standing along streets near the Presidential Palace and the National Police Headquarters, or waiting for customers at bars inside lavish hotels and nightclubs. As Jakarta is littered with prostitutes, there is absolutely everything for everyone. For high-income people, places such as Kota, Jl. Gajah Mada and Jl. Harmoni in Central Jakarta are havens for those seeking such pleasures. There is also Jakarta’s largest red-light district of Kalijodo, located on the border of West Jakarta and North Jakarta, which is probably the oldest site in Indonesia, as it has been around since the 18th century. For those of a lower-income, however, there are numerous hunting grounds, and Cipinang is the latest on the list of Jakarta’s underbelly. According to local residents, prostitution has been in Cipinang since as early as 1993, centering in a park near the Jatinegara station. “There used to be only transgendered prostitutes here,” recalled Ukim, a street vendor operating near the station. But public order officers had driven them out four years ago, he said. “Such measures eventually failed to deter the business, as the transvestites, along with female prostitutes, moved to sidewalks to net customers,” said Ukim. Every night, from around 8 p.m. until around 3 a.m., young girls below 20 years of age, dressed in alluring outfits, lined the sidewalks to lure customers. One girl, no older than 12, could be seen roaming around looking for customers. Most of the prostitutes are from Indramayu, a coastal city in northern West Java. The prostitutes charge customers around Rp 50,000 (US$5.7) for a short time in a small tent beside the railways near the Jatinegara station, or Rp 250,000 in nearby lodges. Another infamous red-light district is Bongkaran in Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta — only few meters from the Tanah railway station, the iconic Tanah Abang traditional market, the Jakarta textile museum and a police post. The area is also two kilometers away from the headquarters of notorious hard-line group the Islam Defender Front (FPI) on Jl. Pejompongan. The FPI has regularly used violence to crack down on places they deemed against Islamic values such as bars, clubs and karaoke parlors. Sexual transactions at Bongkaran take place day and night in shabby shacks along the railway or in cheap hotels nearby. The area has existed since the 1960s, and attracts high-income people as well. When The Jakarta Post was recently on site, a black Toyota Alphard was seen picking up a young prostitute and taking her to a nearby hotel. Unlike Cipinang, where nearly all of the prostitutes are from outside Jakarta, Bongkaran pools many prostitutes whose parents live nearby. Some of them are even still in junior and senior high school. Customers are usually charged between Rp 50,000 and Rp 150,000 for a short time. In 2000, prostitution in Bongkaran was only centered in the vicinity of the Tanah Abang bridge and the railway below it. Today, it has expanded by a radius of around 50 meters, stretching nearer to the Tanah Abang railway station. Prostitution in Bongkaran, however, is prohibited every Thursday night due to an instruction from local leaders — who are of Betawi ethnicity — to respect Islam’s holy day of Friday. Urban experts have repeatedly blamed weak law enforcement and a lack of coordination among government agencies for the mushrooming prostitution. “The local administration should treat the prostitution problem as an emergency, considering it’s the tip of the iceberg of all the other social ills,” said Nirwono Yoga, an urban analyst at Trisakti University. “It’s nearly impossible to eradicate prostitution. It’s about time to create special clusters for prostitutes so that the city administration can easily control their health, and limit the practices.” According to prostitutes operating in Cipinang and Bongkaran, the last time they received a health inspection by the local administration to detect AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases was in 2004. There are no official figures on the number of prostitutes in Jakarta which would allow the scale of the industry to be gauged. But the Bongkaran area alone is estimated to have at least 700 girls. The Kalijodo red-light district, as another example, holds the livelihoods of at least 5,000 people — from hoodlums to sex workers, brothel owners to waiters, and cigarette and food vendors to local residents, according to West Jakarta administration officials. As formal employment is hard to get, most low-income people are getting profoundly tied to the continued existence of such a district. Umi (not her real name), a mother of a child prostitute in Bongkaran, said her family had no other options to make ends meet than engaging in such a business. “It [prostitution] is better for the girls than having an affair or being abused, because there’s some [financial] compensation to it,” she said.

"Wed, April 20 2011","20,000 police to safeguard Jakarta during Easter","As many as 20,000 police officers will guard houses of worship in Jakarta to secure the Easter holiday period, which will begin on Friday, City Police operational bureau head Sr. Comr. Sujarno said. “We will deploy officers to guard churches and other vital objects,” Sujarno stated on Tuesday. Sujarno added that the deployment would be based on jurisdiction, because officers had better knowledge about their respective areas of operation. “Each subdistrict police office will be responsible for the security of every subdistrict,” he said. The police urged Jakartans to stay alert, even though there were no indications of potential terrorist activity, Sujarno added. Security once again came to the forefront of public attention following a suicide bombing that took place during Friday prayers last week at the AZ-Dzikra mosque inside the Cirebon City Police compound in West Java. Twenty-five people, mostly police officers, were wounded. Muhammadiyah Youth Central Board chief Saleh Daulay told The Jakarta Post on Tuesday that he had already attempted to implement strong structural preventive safeguard procedures in order for his organization to avoid any violence. “I have made an official instruction through letter and [other] media, asking my members to be cautious against possible provocation from irresponsible individuals or groups which might cause unrest,” he said. “We are ready to stand on the front-line to fight against possible threats to religious harmony,” he added. Saleh, however, said that the Muhammadiyah Youth had not yet prepared personnel to help guard churches around Jakarta. “However, if in one or two days ahead there are threats, we will surely take actions,” he said. Saleh said that he was reluctant to deploy his people to act as a security force, “To be honest, not everyone is sympathetic with [security] activities,” he said. Saleh added that he hoped the bombing would not be used as justification for further violence under the banner of vengeance. “The cost that must be paid for violent acts against religious difference is too high,” he said. The central board of the Muhammadiyah Youth reportedly has a paramilitary wing, called the Security Command (Kokam). Islam Defenders Front (FPI) secretary-general Ahmad Sobri Lubis told The Jakarta Post that although their organization was often characterized as radical, they were ready if the authorities asked them to safeguard Easter celebrations. Ahmad said that FPI now was now focused on protesting the new movie, simply titled ?, for its pluralist theme. The FPI has threatened to raid cinemas if the film is not removed from the big screen this month. The Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) has set up a team to formulate recommendations of banning the movie.

"Thu, May 5 2011",City Police rush to uncover SBY license plate owner,"The City Police have launched an investigation to identify the owner of a car that has the license plate number B 8360 SBY, which has been construed as an insult against President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. “Our intelligence division is cooperating with the Bogor Police to investigate the case,” City Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Baharuddin Djafar told reporters. A photo of a car license plate reading B 8360 SBY has been circulating on social media networks over the past few days. Some believe that the license plate was created to insult the President, who is often referred to as SBY. The license plate, they say, can be read as “BEGO SBY”. Bego means idiot in local slang. Some alleged that the car pictured in the photo — a Toyota Fortuner – belongs to local psychic and TV personality Ki Gendeng Pamungkas. This conclusion was prompted by a sticker of the Front Pribumi (Indigenous Front) mass organization plastered on the rear window of the car. Ki Gendeng was chairman of the organization. Baharudin said the police would have to check that the photo was authentic before investigating who the license plate belonged to. Some social network users said the photo had likely been digitally manipulated because the letters were not uniform. “Our investigators will check if the vehicle with the plate really exists or not,” Baharudin said on Wednesday. Previously, City Police Traffic Division head Sr. Comr. Royke Lumowa said the license plate was not listed in the police database and was therefore illegal. Royke said a person working for Ki Gendeng had once applied for the same license plate number. “We rejected the request as we thought the plate could have a negative meaning,” Royke said. He added that it was possible that the photo was a fake. The Constitutional Court has annulled three articles in the Criminal Code that criminalized the act of insulting the president. However, the President is allowed to file a complaint to the police if he is insulted. In March last year, the city police issued a regulation banning animals at protest rallies after a group of demonstrators brought to a rally a water buffalo that had the word “Sibuya” painted on its rear. “Sibuya” was seen as a reference to SBY. However, in February this year, the City Police did nothing when members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) threatened to launch a revolution and unseat Yudhoyono if the Ahmadiyah religious sect was not disbanded. Ismail Hasani, a member of human rights think tank Setara Institute, said the police’s investigation into the license plate picture showed that they were inconsistent in upholding the law. He said the police had likely chosen to address the license plate issue because it was an easy, whereas cracking down on radical groups such as FPI was more risky. “There are political choices that have to be made when it comes to the hard-line organizations. The license plate issue has no major political implication,” Ismail told The Jakarta Post on Tuesday.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/05/city-police-rush-uncover-sby-license-plate-owner.html,,2011

"Fri, May 13 2011",Bintan to go ahead with bikini beach party,"Organizers in Bintan Island in Riau Islands province plan to hold a bikini beach party at the Nirwana Garden Resort located in the Lagoi International Tourism Zone, which will be aired by Fashion TV, on May 14. Large signboards have been erected on a number of streets on neighboring Batam Island in the past month promoting the Bikini Beach Party. However, organizers were forced to temporarily cover the signboards due to mounting protests, but reiterated they would go ahead with the event according to schedule. Muslim organizations such as the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), Indonesian Mosque Youth Communication Forum (BKPRMI), Malay Cultural Council (LAM) and Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) have lambasted the planned event. They claimed the event was immoral and violated eastern cultures as well as the antipornography law. The head of the Riau Islands branch of the MUI, Tengku Azhari Abbas, told The Jakarta Post on Thursday the MUI was shocked to learn the event would be held on Bintan, despite the fact that the ethnic Malays in Bintan and the Riau Islands are mainly Muslim. He claimed the event would have a negative impact on the public, so the MUI was opposed to it. “Although we have expressed our objection, the organizers remain firm about staging the event. We have sent a letter of objection to the Riau Islands governor and asked the police to ban the event. We urge the government to listen to our objections and aspirations,” Azhari said. He said the event violated the controversial 2008 Anti-pornography Law because organizers advertised the event, which will showcase the bodies of scantily clad women. “The government must be objective in judging whether the event is beneficial or detrimental. We want tourism to develop, but we must uphold local values and cultures,” Azhari said. The head of the local FPI branch, Achyar Nasution, agreed. He said his group had issued an ultimatum to organizers to call off the event or face an FPI raid. Nirwana Garden Resort administrative director Anton told the Post that the event would take place as scheduled as organizers had obtained a permit from the National Police in Jakarta. “Actually, there is a misunderstanding as there is no objection. The dress code for the beach party is white bikinis. It’s natural to wear a bikini on the beach, but not to the market. The event will be held as scheduled,” Anton said. He added that Fashion TV Singapore was organizing the event and that Nirwana Garden Resort would provide the venue. Organizers said 1,000 people are expected at the event, with 800 confirmed to attend. “Security for the event will be normal and reinforcements are not required because the area is safe for such an event,” Anton said. He said Fashion TV would tape and air the event in its line of programming. Bintan Tourism Agency head Akib Rahman said his agency supported the event as the venue was far from residential areas. He added that such an event would attract more visitors to Bintan. “There won’t be any problems as long as they are not naked. The venue is also far from residential areas. I think calling for a ban is inappropriate,” Akib said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/13/bintan-go-ahead-with-bikini-beach-party.html,,2011
"Wed, May 18 2011",Hard-line Islamic groups active on campuses,"Ikhwanul Muslimin Date Established : The organization was brought to Indonesia in the 1970s by pilgrims, Arab immigrants and Indonesians who studied in Egypt and the Middle East. Members : Around 9 million Leader : Habib Husein Al Habsyi Ideology : The Ikhawnul Muslimin, or the Muslim Brotherhood, was founded in 1928 by hard-line Islamic scholar Hassan al-Banna, who advocated a non-violent political approach for reclaiming Islam’s manifest destiny: an empire stretching from Spain to Indonesia. While the organization mainly operates below the radar in Indonesia, scholars believe that the nation’s fourth largest political party, the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), is a public political manifestation of the Ikhawnul Muslimin. Background : Imaddudin Abdul Rahim, a charismatic student activist and lecturer at the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) introduced the movement to his peers at ITB in the 1970s. By the early 1980s, Bang Imad’s teachings were adopted by activists at several leading universities, including the University of Indonesia in Depok, West Java; the Bogor Agricultural Institute; and Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta. The Muslim Brotherhood had a major influence on Indonesia’s movements in the mid-1980s after many Middle East-educated clerics and scholars — including Abu Ridha and Rahman Zainuddin, who both became noted PKS figures — translated books written by Al Banna and other IM leaders, such as Sa’id Hawwa and Sayyid Qutb, into Indonesian. Islam Defenders Front (FPI) Date Established : August 1998 Members : At least 50,000 Leader : Al-Habib Muhammad Rizieq bin Husein Syihab Ideology : The FPI’s struggle is aimed at crushing activities deemed unfit by Islam, such as prostitution, gambling, drinking and atheism. Members of the group have allegedly been implicated in the use of extreme violence on many occasions, leading critics to claim that the FPI has trumped the rule of law in secular Indonesia. However, the violence allegedly wrought by the group’s members has been less destructive than that of Jamaah Islamiyah, the terrorist group behind a series of bombings, or Laskar Jihad (Jihad Troops), which incited a sectarian conflict in Maluku. Background : Inspired by the FPI’s alleged use of violence to crush acts it deems offensive to Islam, large numbers of university students began to support the organization in early 2000, albeit at a low intensity. Some regional FPI leaders have reportedly been busy working as ad-hoc political mercenaries without the consent of the FPI’s headquarters. Those leaders have allegedly used the FPI’s name to form for-hire splinter groups to support political parties and regional leaders. Salafy Date Established : During the 1980s Members : At least 100,000 Leader : Scattered in small groups Background : Safady is an orthodox Islamic group that propagates the teachings and practice of tauhid (monotheism) and fiqh (Islamic rulings) that were applied during the time of the Prophet Muhammad’s companions (sahabah), followers (tabi‘un) and those who came after the followers (al-Tabi’in). The movement is sometimes associated with a puritan approach to the mystical sufi (holy men) tradition. Safady has a splinter faction in the Middle East that supports violence, though few such splinter groups or teachings reached Indonesia. Most of the group’s followers — easily recognizable in their veils and turbans — peacefully preach about a need to return to the pure Islam practiced in the times of the Prophet Muhammad. Notes: The group has not mixed well with other Islamic movements, such as Ikhwanul Muslimin. Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) Date Established : Early 1980 Members : More than 1.2 million Leader : Hafidz Abdurrahman Ideology : Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (the Liberation Party in Indonesia) seeks to implement sharia by reinstating the Caliphate by intellectual and political means without resorting to violence. The group is the local arm of the international Hizbut Tahrir organization, which was established in 1953 in Jerusalem, Palestine. Background : The HTI preached and taught religion on several prominent college campuses in the 1980s and expanded its activities to mosques, offices, companies and residences to include a wider public audience in the 1990s. At a conference in 2002, the HTI became a movement when it declared itself a political party, though it refused to join the existing political system. Despite critics who claim that the HTI is a hard-line group, its leaders insist that it is an organization that believes in dialogue and eschews violence in propagating its messages. The HTI’s leadership maintains that the group offers a justifiable and testable solution to the nation’s ills, i.e., sharia law. Rallying under the slogan “Save Indonesia with sharia”, HTI has organized several activities to remind people that an “Islamic solution” emanating from the “Most Benevolent and Merciful” is the only answer for humanity. The Islamic solution, i.e., sharia, will liberate people from the shackles of secular capitalism and their corrupt and exploitative rulers. Islamic State of Indonesia (NII) Date Established : August 1949 Members : More than 700,000 Leader : Separated into 14 factions Ideology : The movement wants to establish – using violence, as needed – an Islamic state in Indonesia that will implement sharia by reinstating the Caliphate. Background : The NII has a long history in Indonesia, starting with the Darul Islam movement that was proclaimed on August 7, 1949 by Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosoewirjo in West Java. Kartosoewirjo was arrested and executed in 1962. However, his spirit and ideology of struggle remains alive and well until now. Some members of jihadist movements, including Abu Bakar Ba’asyir and his colleague Abdullah Sungkar, were reportedly inspired by the NII. Other NII factions, however, have strayed from the movement’s original course, with their leaders using the movement to enrich themselves. One such controversial faction was the NII KW9, which primarily recruited university students whom the movement would then extort. In some cases, the movement reportedly hypnotized followers to ensure their allegiance. Jihadi Date Established : During the 1980s Members : More than 2,000 Leader : Unknown due to the group’s underground nature Ideology : The group seeks to implement sharia by reinstating the Caliphate through violence. Background : The movement was fueled by the guerrilla war to stop the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s. Members of the Jihadi are usually comprised of radical members of Salafy and Ikhwanul Muslimin. Osama bin Laden was a member of Jihadi, whose followers also came from Afghanistan; Moro, the Philippines; and Chechnya, Russia. Members of Jihadi in Indonesia include stout followers of the Darul Islam movement (DI), including Abdullah Sungkar and Abu Bakar Ba’asyir’s faction that later formed terrorist network Jamaah Islamiyah (JI).",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/18/hard-line-islamic-groups-active-campuses.html,,2011
"Fri, May 20 2011",Letter: Regretful methods in war on terror,"I would like to respond to John Hargreaves, who commented on my article titled Obama vs Osama: A lose-lose solution published on May 5, 2011. I base my opinion on Obama’s speech in Cairo in which he did say he wanted to reach out to the Muslim world, also on the sovereignty of nations over their own territory and on what has become internationally accepted that everyone should have the right to a fair trial (for example most of us accepted Milosevic’s capture and trial). There are human rights charters and conventions which the US itself has signed. And finally I base mine not on an endorsement of extremist views, far from it. You might consider it naive but I do feel strongly that we need to act according to the law and correctly and not stoop to the level of the terrorists. If you read carefully what I am regretting is not the fight against terrorism but the methodology, which in fact has played into the terrorists hands. And I have never endorsed Yudhoyono’s wavering. I have been a staunch critic of it. The government has let the FPI get away with murder literally. It needs to know it is not above the law. I have always felt the law should be enforced as it is written and as a citizen of this country I feel that urgency very deeply. But that doesn’t mean I endorse murder or summary execution of suspects. That is a very, very slippery road.

"Mon, May 23 2011",Comment: UN: RI laws restrict religious freedom,"May 18, online The United Nations’ High Commissioner for Human Rights Navanethem Pillay has urged Indonesia to review its laws restricting religious expression and practice. In a letter sent to Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa, a copy of which was obtained by The Jakarta Post on Wednesday, Pillay expressed his concern over reports of violence against members of religious minorities in Indonesia. Your comments: Every person of conscience should raise a voice for the freedom of religion and expression, wherever there are any violations. Earlier immigrants came to the US for religious freedom and based on these universal principles. America today has been blessed to be a great country. This is a proof that no nation can progress unless they ensure freedom of religion for their people. Suhail Kausar The US If the Indonesian government doesn’t stop and disband the FPI who killed the Ahmadis, the entire world will go against us. Dani Jakarta Thank you United Nations’ High Commissioner for Human Rights Navanethem Pillay. Yes Indonesia should review its laws restricting religious minorities before it is too late. All human beings are free to choose their faith or how they want to worship. Especially Islam gives freedom to everyone to practice their religion as they want. SLatif The US Sorry but the UN is wasting its time. Elements in the Indonesian government support the FPI and other fundamentalist groups so SBY is powerless to take any action. Remember the FPI stated that if he tried, they would bring down the entire SBY government. He was even unable to take action against them after that seditious statement.

"Tue, June 14 2011",FPI leaves its mark in local neighborhood,"A flag with a green triangle, the logo for the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), flies in an alley in a densely populated neighborhood in Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta. A sizeable building stands at the end of the alley where the group runs its day-to-day operations. Beside serving as the organization’s headquarters, it also doubles as the home of FPI leader Habib Muhammad Rizieq Syihab. About 300 meters behind the FPI headquarters, stands Bethel Church, not far from Al-Islah mosque where FPI leaders usually deliver their sermons. “There will be a sermon in the mosque tonight,” Syafrudin Perwiranegara, a young FPI activist, told The Jakarta Post recently. Syafrudin, 17, said Rizieq served his sermon every Wednesday. Sermons are also delivered on Friday and Thursday nights every two months. Syafrudin is a member of the FPI’s youth organization, Pelaksana Hari Besar Islam (PHBI), whose chores include cleaning the mosque and attending sermons. He was sent to Yogyakarta as a volunteer when the Merapi Mountain erupted in 2010. “Hundreds of youths from the FPI were sent there at that time,” Syafrudin said. Syafrudin said every day he attended Yoshua senior high school in Kota Bambu Utara, in the nearby Palmerah district. “I have no problem with the fact that it is a Christian school,” he said. When the Post walked down one of the neighborhood allies and, Abun, a local in the neighborhood was spotted trying to separate a fight between children playing in the area. Abun, who is in his 60s, has lived in the neighborhood throughout his whole life. He runs a small kiosk selling snacks, cigarettes and groceries to residents in the neighborhood. “I was there in 2008 when many police trucks were parked on the road [near the alley] and police officers raided the FPI headquarters,” he said, referring to police raids of the FPI headquarters in 2008 after the FPI attacked the Alliance for the Freedom of Religion and Faith at the National Monument Park, Central Jakarta. “But we are not bothered by the FPI here,” he said. In fact, the presence of the FPI has become the source of pride for locals in the neighborhood. A local resident, Habibi, who has been living there since he was born, told the Post in front of the Al-Islah mosque that he was proud that the FPI was in his neighborhood. “With the FPI’s presence, I can get more knowledge. Where would I find such knowledge if the great teacher did not live here,” he said, referring to Rizieq. Habibi said that in fact the FPI had built an Islamic boarding school in its headquarters compound, which was opened late last year. T. Sukaen, another resident in the neighborhood said there was no problem with the FPI’s presence in the area. Sukaen said that as a Muslim he was also proud the FPI could be the conduit for spreading Islamic teachings. Ade, a 40-year-old single mother who was born in Pekalongan, Central Java, and has been living in the neighborhood since she was a child, said the FPI could give her the spiritual refuge she needed due to the hectic lifestyle of living in the city. She told the Post that her mother often attended women-only sermons organized by the FPI. “I have no problems with its presence, there is no inconvenience caused by it. My only problem with it is that it sometimes resorts to violence,” she said. (rpt)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/14/fpi-leaves-its-mark-local-neighborhood.html,,2011
"Mon, June 20 2011",Two groups in tension over Ahmadiyah,"MAKASSAR: Through their leaders, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and the Pancasila Youth in Makassar signed a peace pact before police officials. The tension originated from a misunderstanding between the groups’ members. Pancasila Youth regional secretary Andi Azikin said FPI members misinterpreted the situation when they saw Pancasila Youth by an Ahmadiyah Mosque. “The FPI members thought we were defending the people at the Ahmadiyah mosque. The truth is we are not involved in Ahmadiyah issues,” Azikin said Sunday. The FPI was reportedly at the site to prevent people from performing prayers at the mosque. According to witnesses, FPI members provoked Pancasila Youth activists. Pancasila activists were then forced back to their headquarters where they allegedly planned to respond. Ahmadiyah devotees have been subject to much discrimination in the country and the FPI has been active in suppressing the Ahmadiyah people. — JP",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/20/two-groups-tension-over-ahmadiyah.html,,2011
"Mon, July 18 2011",Hardliners banned from doing raids,"The Jakarta Police will take firm action against mass organizations that conduct raids on business establishments during the fasting month of Ramadhan, which begins in August. Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Baharudin Djafar said Saturday that raids could only be conducted by law enforcement officers. “[Civilians] are not allowed to carry out raids. Mass organizations may monitor neighborhoods and report any disturbances to the police. “They are free to do anything else that can positively impact on Ramadhan,” Baharudin told The Jakarta Post. “We held a meeting several days ago with representatives from mass organizations and business owners and we managed to reach an agreement that the law would only be upheld by the police,” he added. Islamic and ethnic-based hardline groups are infamous for their raids on entertainment premises during Ramadhan or even at other times of the year as the hardliners view such places as morally corrupting. Commenting on the police statement, the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) said it appreciated the commitment of law enforcement officers to maintain peace and order during Ramadhan. “The police show that they are committed to doing their job and therefore there is no need for mass organizations to conduct raids during Ramadhan,” FPI secretary-general Sobri Lubis told the Post. “We are not going to carry out raids as long as the police do their job and uphold the law,” he added. Before the start of Ramadhan last year, the FPI and other mass organizations met with then Jakarta Police chief Timur Pradopo to agree that civilian groups would not carry out raids during the fasting month. But some of these radical groups were at times free to use violence outside of Ramadhan. Late last year, three Muslim organizations raided and sealed homes belonging to Christians in Rancaekek, Bandung, they claim were being used as churches. Supporters of the FPI, the Islamic People’s Forum (FUI) and the Islamic Reform Movement (Garis), along with local public order officers began raided and sealed seven homes and called on the Christians to hold prayers in official churches. The Jakarta administration has restricted operating hours for entertainment establishments across the city for Ramadhan. Six categories of establishments face full closure, while other establishments will have reduced opening hours. Nightclubs, spas, massage parlors, video poker dens and bars (both standalone bars and those located in other establishments) must cease operations a day before Ramadhan begins and can only resume business a day after the Idul Fitri holiday ends. Karaoke and live music lounges will only be allowed to operate from 8:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. during the period. Pool halls located within other establishments face the same restrictions, while standalone pool halls can operate from 10 a.m. until midnight. Entertainment establishments managed by star-rated hotels can continue to operate normally. However, entertainment spots in hotels as well as karaoke bars, live music lounges and pool halls are to close on the day before and at the start of Ramadhan, the 10 days before the end of Ramadhan, the eve of Idul Fitri, the two days of Idul Fitri and the day after Idul Fitri. The administration has restricted opening hours for entertainment spots since 2004 through a gubernatorial decree. Business owners deemed to be in violation of the regulation face up to three months in prison and/or a maximum fine of Rp 5 million (US$585). The establishments may also be sealed off or have their permits revoked for repeated violations.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/07/18/hardliners-banned-doing-raids.html,,2011

But Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Untung S. Radjab said public order and security was only achievable if residents abided by all regulations and laws. “During Ramadhan, people are required to control their inner lust until they reach the final day, which is Idul Fitri. Fitri means a return to our purest essence,” Untung told reporters on Friday. “So, let us remind one another during Ramadhan that we must do the best we can for others,” he added. Two-star general Untung reiterated his support to involve mass organizations in securing public order in the city. He warned mass organizations that enforcement measures could only be conducted by the police, however. In reference to well-known hardline and violent groups such as the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) and Betawi ethnic-based groups, who are known to take justice into their own hands, including raids on entertainment centers, Untung underlined that only the police had law enforcement authority. The FPI promised police last month that it would not conduct raids during Ramadhan. The group is known for its action against minority groups. The Betawi Brotherhood Forum (FBR) and the Betawi People Communication Forum (Forkabi) are allegedly often involved in thuggery. They have denied the allegations. The police will launch an operation called Kilat Jaya, which will run from Aug. 2 to 14. Jakarta Police operations chief Sr. Comr. Sujarno said all police units from the district up to the metropolitan level would participate in the public order operation. “We predict an increase in consumer product needs throughout the fasting month and Idul Fitri. Crime rates will also be affected, in line with the increase of consumer product needs and, therefore, we are launching this operation,” he said. “The operation is targeting street crime such as thuggery, robbery and violence, including the use of fireworks, and monitoring empty houses,” he added. According to Jakarta Police data, 439 robberies took place during last year’s Ramadhan. The police also listed 73 violent robberies during that time.

"Wed, August 3 2011",FPI raids stalls selling alcohol,"Despite warnings by authorities’ condemning vigilantism, members of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) took to the streets in Bandung to demonstrate against consumption of alcohol, particularly during Ramadhan. Their target were stalls selling the traditional alcoholic brew, known as tuak, near the Cibiru traffic circle, some 15 kilometers east of Bandung, where they seized at least 50 jerry cans of the beverage. The FPI members, mostly wearing white outfits, arrived at the tuak stalls at 10:15 p.m. on Monday. They immediately entered the stalls, usually frequented by public minivan drivers of the Batak community from North Sumatra, to search for tuak. Panyileukan Police chief Adj. Comr. Komarna said the FPI crowd handed over 30 jerry cans, most of which were already empty, as proof of the sale of alcohol at the stalls. “We asked them to stop because the FPI should have reported the matter to us, because according to the law the police should be in front to handle the matter,” Komarna told reporters in Bandung on Tuesday. FPI members, together with police, approached a place in the Cibiru area, believed to be a tuak warehouse, at around 9:50 a.m. on Tuesday. The police seized around 20 jerry cans of tuak, most of them also empty. No injuries occurred during the second act, but detectives from the Panyileukan Police brought a stall owner to the police station for questioning. Police called on mass organizations not to assume the duties of the police, such as raiding entertainment places and shops selling alcohol ahead of Ramadhan. FPI field coordinator Amin said his group had carried out the “clean-up” action following reports from the community. “We hope that everyone respects the fasting month and do not engage in immoral deeds, especially during the day time,” Amin said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/03/fpi-raids-stalls-selling-alcohol.html,,2011

The demonstrators, all in white, came from FPI branches nationwide. They carried banners, one of which read “Indonesia is not a state of Islam. But it is not a state of devils, either.” The rally caused traffic congestion in the area around the State Palace as demonstrators parked their vehicles along the road. Your comments: Apart from pointing that out, I should like also to point out that the moral earnestness of the FPI must always be within the law of the land and that neither they, nor the people they oppose, have the right to presume to take the law into their own hands. Once they do this, they have destroyed their basis for credibility. They cannot excuse themselves by saying, “But we claim to be working from the position of Allah’s authority which overrides the law of the land” because, as they have rightly pointed out, they believe Indonesia is not an Islamic state. Their banner said so today. The FPI needs to be faithful to what today they have publicly proclaimed, in both their behavior and logic. After all, that is what they are asking the President and the rest of the country to do. Good on them. Let them lead the way by being the law-abiding citizens of Indonesia, which is not, in their words, an Islamic state.

"Mon, September 5 2011",WikiLeaks: National Police funded FPI hard-liners,"The National Police and the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) denied on Sunday allegations in leaked US diplomatic cables that say the hard-line Islamic group receives funding from the police. Published on WikiLeaks’ website, the document said the police used the group as “an attack dog” and named several top brass as responsible for the funding. National Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Boy Rafli Amar said the police treat the FPI as they would any other civilian group. “As a part of society, the FPI is our partner … in a positive way,” Boy said. He said WikiLeaks had published “inaccurate data and false facts”. “We should not believe information coming from such a very shallow analysis,” he added. The anti-censorship website on Tuesday continued to release thousands of US diplomatic cables that originated from the US Embassy in Jakarta. The cable that alleged an illicit partnership between the police and the National Intelligence Agency (BIN) and the FPI was dated May 9, 2006. FPI spokesman Munarman said that the claim was made by “a BIN agent who regularly sold false information to the US”. The document said that a BIN agent, Yahya Assegaf, had told the US Embassy that, prior to the Feb. 19, 2006, vandalism of the US Embassy in Jakarta, then National Police chief Gen. (ret.) Sutanto, who currently serves as BIN chief, had “provided some funds to the FPI”. The cable, however, does not disclose the amount of the funds. The vandalism occurred when the FPI protested the publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. “Yahya is among those who have sufficiently close contact within the FPI to provide [the US Embassy] with advance notice of the FPI’s hostile intent hours prior to the embassy violence.” According to the cable, Yahya also told embassy officials that Sutanto “found it useful to have the FPI available to him as an ‘attack dog’”. “When pressed further on the usefulness of the FPI playing this role, noting that the police should be sufficiently capable of intimidation, Yahya characterized the FPI as a tool that could spare the security forces from criticism for human rights violations, and he said funding the FPI was a ‘tradition’ of the police and BIN,” the cable says. According to the cable, Yahya said the FPI “had obtained a majority of its funds from the security forces”. Munarman accused Yahya of being “one of the US’s cronies”. “If [Yahya] was really a BIN agent selling information to the US, then he would truly be a traitor and could be sentenced to death according to the Criminal Code,” Munarman added. He also accused WikiLeaks of working for US interests. “Why has Wikileaks never released any diplomatic cables about Israel?” Munarman said. The cable also alleges that the FPI had close contact with former Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. (ret.) Nugroho Djayusman, who admitted to embassy officials that he had connections with radical Islamic groups. “[Nugroho] explained defensively that it was natural for him, as the Jakarta Police chief, to have contact with all sorts of organizations. This was necessary because the sudden release of energy from the Islamists, who had been repressed under [former president] Soeharto, could have posed a security risk,” the cable says. “But it doesn’t mean I was involved,” Nugroho said as quoted by the cable. Boy reiterated that the police would never treat FPI members differently — particularly if in violation of law. “Any law violator, without exception, must face legal processes under the law,” he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/09/05/wikileaks-national-police-funded-fpi-hard-liners.html,,2011

"Mon, September 26 2011",Letter: FPI and corruption eradication,"This is a comment from the website to the online article entitled “FPI now talks about corruption eradication” on Sept. 22. Two weeks ago, I attended an informal meeting discussing how to eradicate corruption. It was held on the slopes of Mount Wilis in Kediri, East Java. The discussion was interesting and lively since the participants were given enough time to discuss it. The speakers among others were Permadi, Maj. Gen. (ret) Saurip Kadi, Sasmito Hadinagoro, Rieke Diah Pitaloka, Justiani and Jati Kusumo. The next day, I received an SMS on an anti corruption movement. It told me that there would be an institution called “Anti-Corruption Fighters” (LAKI) that would be declared on Sept. 22, 2011 at the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) office. The organization claimed to have secured support from politicians and anti-graft activists. But to my surprise, in the SMS, the institution is led by Habib Rizieq and some other prominent figures like Permadi, Rizal Ramli, Ridwan Saidi, Gen (retired) Tyasno Sudarto, Yoes Soetomo, Marwah Daud Ibrahim, Habib Husein Alhabsi, Hari Azhar Azis, Sri Bintang Pamungkas, Hariman Siregar, Abdul Aziz Qohar Muzakkar, Gen (retired) Endiartono Sutarto, KH Fuad Thohari, Deddy Miswar, Pong Harjatmo, Loade Ida, Noer Bahri Noor. The president of LAKI is Dicky Candra. For me, figures like Permadi, Pong Harjatmo, Dedy Miswar, Loade Ida and Fuad Bawazier are no strangers. They are corruption fighters now but I am not sure about the others, especially Habib Rizieq, and some retired generals. What will Habib Rizieq do to eradicate corruption? Will he order his paramilitary troops to ransack offices or companies linked to corruption? For some other figures, I hope they can really have the courage to eradicate corruption in Indonesia, but not by being opportunistic.

Ten of the 14 injured victims, up from the eight victims previously reported, were taken to Dr. Oen Kandangsapi Hospital. “Some had to be operated upon,” hospital general manager William Tanoyo said on Sunday as reported by tempointeraktif.com. William said the level of injury sustained by the victims ranged from severe to light and that four people had already been released. Your comments: These episodes will continue as long as the government encourages them through inaction. Two months in jail for a killing will surely fail to discourage radicals.

"Sun, October 23 2011",Is film censorship necessary?,"A scene from the movie ?. Courtesy of Mahaka Pictures Indonesian filmmakers have always faced the threat of censorship, whether under the Old Order, the New Order or the Reform era. All films, Indonesian or foreign, go to the Film Censorship Board (LSF) before they are screened in local cinemas. However, in addition to the LSF — the nation’s official film censor — there has been pressure from members of the public to ban particular movies. During Ramadhan this year, local broadcaster SCTV was threatened by the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) when it planned to present a recent film on religious pluralism with the unique title ?. Bowing to the pressure, the television station dropped the plan to screen the film, directed by Hanung Bramantyo. In a discussion with journalists, Hanung said he was bewildered by his film’s rejection by Muslims, hard-liners or not. He thought people would understand his true purpose was to clarify misleading arguments about Islam. He was wrong. “As a Muslim, I have a responsibility to counter arguments which portray Islam a radical religion. I am defending Islam from such attacks with this film, but many Muslims accuse me of profanity and apostasy,” he said. He was powerless when representatives of several Muslim organizations forced cinemas in some cities to stop screening the film. SCTV played it safe by canceling its plan to screen the film. Harsiwi Ahmad, the station’s programming director, said she still wanted to air Hanung’s film, albeit after tensions eased. “I would not have bought the film if it did not have good quality and values. We haven’t had further internal discussion on when to air it, but I certainly look forward to it,” she said. Tito Imanda, the head of Binus International University’s film department, said SCTV had every right to air the film, since it had already been approved by the LSF. Hanung’s film adds to the long list of provocative movies that have been censored or banned in Indonesia. In 2009, the LSF banned a screening of the Australian film Balibo Five at the Jakarta International Film Festival, arguing that it might have opened old wounds. The film tells the story of Australian journalists massacred in East Timor in 1975. In 2010, the FPI threatened to use force to shut down the Q! Film Festival, which presents queer-and HIV/AIDS-themed films. The festival completed its most recent edition earlier this month, conducted with a low profile and with very little publication and media exposure. The first Indonesian film to be banned from the nation’s screens was the brilliant psychological war drama Pagar Kawat Berduri (the barbed wire fence, 1961). The movie, helmed by Wahyu Sihombing, told the story of independence fighters led by Sukarno M. Noer as they tried to survive life in a Dutch prisoner of war camp. The film was banned under pressure from the now-defunct Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). Other films were banned out of fear that their content might cause controversy. Romusha ( 1972 ), for example, was scrapped by the government to protect relations with Japan, while Nyoman dan Presiden (Nyoman and the President, 1989) was changed to Nyoman Cinta Merah Putih (Nyoman loves the flag). Tito said that the nation’s film industry needed a film classification agency, not a censorship body. Such an agency could determine which films were appropriate for children, teenagers or adults. “There should be clear rules on, for example, the duration of scenes on kissing or the presence of drugs and smoking scenes that are not suitable for children. This, however, should be followed by strict regulation of the cinema,” he said. Twenty-five Indonesian films have been banned from local exhibition since the 1960s, according to the invaluable reference website filmindonesia.or.id, managed by the National Library and the non-profit Indonesian film archive Sinematek. “Politics used to be the reason why films were banned in the past. Now we see films banned for moral reasons,” Tito said. “This is nonsense.”",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/10/23/is-film-censorship-necessary.html,,2011
"Tue, November 15 2011",Ahmadis threatened at Bekasi mosque,"Vigilante groups in Bekasi, West Java, issued a threatening warning to the local Ahmadiyah community on Monday, claiming that the followers of the Islamic sect had not abided by a bylaw issued by the city’s mayor a month ago that bans its members from practicing their religion in the city. The mob, which included dozens of members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), entered an Ahmadiyah mosque in Jati Bening, Bekasi, and called on members of the group to halt all religious activities, including Friday prayers. The mob then erected a banner in front of the Al-Misbag mosque. The banner carried a warning for the Ahmadiyah congregants not to violate the bylaw, or else they would be punished by the local administration. The imam of the mosque, Rahmat Rahmadijaya, said that six Ahmadis were inside the mosque, having just finished their afternoon prayers, when around 30 FPI members arrived. “They did not notify us before about the visit. They just suddenly appeared at the mosque’s front door,” Rahmat told The Jakarta Post on Monday. Rahmat said that some of the FPI members had asked the Ahmadis whether they thought Ahmadiyah was a heretical sect. “They asked us questions such as whether we followed a prophet other than Prophet Muhammad or if we had a holy book other than the Koran,” he said. He said that although the members of the group had not used violence, they had insisted that Ahmadis obey the bylaw, or risk serious punishment. Rahmat said that the congregation had stopped conducting weekly sermons and prayers after the Bekasi administration issued the bylaw. “We have obeyed the rule. But we won’t negotiate with them over daily and Friday prayers. We just can’t do without them,” he said. Rahmat said that performing daily prayers was Ahmadis’ inalienable right. “Besides, we don’t bother anyone around here when we pray,” he said, adding that more than 50 Ahmadis came every day to pray. He said that members of Ahmadiyah in Bekasi would continue performing the ritual inside the mosque despite the ban. Contacted separately, Bekasi Police chief Sr. Comr. Priyo Widianto said that the FPI had not been the only organization that had stormed the mosque. “As a matter of fact, there were members of several religious organizations as well as city officials who put up the banner,” he said, adding that the number of Muslim activists had been exaggerated. Priyo said that the Bekasi Police had supported the crackdown. “The bylaw restricts Ahmadis from performing religious practices and members of these Muslim organizations were just trying to remind them of that,” he said. Priyo said that police personnel had been stationed at the mosque to prevent violence. “We will protect the Ahmadis, but it would be better if they abided by the law. They have been warned over the past months but they continue performing their rituals,” he said. Chairman of human rights watchdog Setara Institute Hendardi said that the siege of the Ahmadi mosque was the logical consequence of a discriminatory bylaw. “The bylaw is against the nation’s Constitution. No institution should be allowed to restrict the freedom of citizens from performing their religious practices, not even the government,” he said.

"Fri, November 18 2011",City seals off Ahmadiyah mosque in East Jakarta,"East Jakarta officials sealed off a mosque belonging to a group of Ahmadiyah followers in Duren Sawit on Thursday, saying that the place of worship violated zoning regulations. Officials from the East Jakarta Building Supervisory Agency (P2B), accompanied by public order officers, closed down At-Taqwa mosque after claiming that the owners of the premises had misused the building permit issued for the premises. In the eviction notice, the P2B said that a building permit had been issued for a private residence, but owners had used the premises as a house of worship. The agency claimed that three warning letters had been issued before the eviction. The head of the East Jakarta branch of the Ahmadiyah, Aryudi Muhammad Shadiq, said the management of the mosque was fully aware of the building violation. “We have been trying to convert the building permit from that for a private residence to one for a public building, but to no avail,” he told The Jakarta Post on Thursday. Aryudi said that bureaucratic red tape had hampered the congregation in obtaining a new building permit. “We spent six months on completing all the required documents. But we didn’t get it,” he said. He suspected that officials of the B2P had intentionally thwarted their efforts to get a new permit. “We feel like the city administration doesn’t support our efforts to get a new permit for the mosque,” he said. Aryudi also questioned the city administration’s decision to seal off the mosque after allowing it to remain open for the past 21 years. “Why now and not years ago? We have never caused problems in the community,” Aryudi said. Since the founding of the mosque in 1990, members of the Ahmadi congregation have performed their rituals in peace and locals had never lodged any complaints. A local Ahmadi cleric living in Duren Sawit, Muhammad Diantono, said the Ahmadi community had been in the area since 1967. “They are all locals who have lived in the area for years. They have become part of the community,” he said. Diantono said that Ahmadis in the area had voluntarily reduced the time they spent on rituals in the mosque even though the East Jakarta administration had made no move to restrict their freedom. Lately, At-Taqwa had held daily prayers only. Previously, the management of the mosque held a weekly sermon and Koran recitation for its 300 members. “Ahmadis in several areas may deal with tighter local regulations, but we have been fine here. Yet, we decided to reduce the time we spent at the mosque to prevent possible conflict,” he said. An East Jakarta Islam Defenders Front (FPI) member, Subhan Amir, said that it was still possible that conflict in the area could result from Ahmadis conducting their rituals at the mosque. “The mosque is a dangerous place for people living nearby because the Ahmadis can be a bad influence. And now locals have realized how dangerous their beliefs are,” he said. Subhan said the FPI supported the B2P’s decision to shut down the mosque. “We will keep an eye on the mosque and if we find that the Ahmadis are still conducting their rituals, we will file a report with the city administration,” said Subhan.

"Sat, January 14 2012",Regions defend alcohol bylaws despite govt calls for revision,"A number of regional administrations are insisting on keeping bylaws that ban the distribution of liquor despite the government’s recommendation that they be repealed because they contradict higher laws and regulations. Bandung municipal administration says its bylaw will remain in force and it will continue to carry out inspections on roadside stalls and minimarkets, ignoring the Home Ministry’s recommendation to revise the bylaw. Bandung’s Industry and Trade Agency head, Ema Sumarna, said on Friday that the administration would carry out inspections on 515 supermarkets, minimarkets and stores to ensure that no alcoholic drinks were sold openly. The policy, he said, was based on a 2010 bylaw and a 2011 municipal decree, both of which stipulate that alcoholic drinks can be sold only at licensed three to five-star hotels, discothèques, karaoke halls and nightclubs. “Supermarkets, minimarkets, shops and jamu [herbal medicine] kiosks are no longer allowed to sell it [alcohol]. If we find any, it will be confiscated.” Bandung Public Order Agency head Ferdi Ligaswara said: “It is in the interest of the public that alcoholic drinks are not sold openly.” In Tangerang, dozens of local Muslim scholars, religious figures and Islamic boarding school students staged a rally at the city administration office to protest the Home Ministry’s recommendation that the administration repeal its 2005 bylaw banning the consumption and distribution of alcoholic drinks. Local Muslim figure Baijuri Kholid said the Home Ministry’s decision was an affront to all Muslims in the country because the presence of such liquor bylaws had helped disseminate Islamic teachings that reject the consumption of alcohol. Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi has acknowledged that his ministry recommended the revocation of hundreds of bylaws nationwide, including nine concerning the distribution of alcoholic drinks. However, he denied that he had repealed the bylaws as alleged by a number of Islamic groups such as the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI). “I don’t have the authority to repeal bylaws. The Home Ministry is only authorized to evaluate and issue recommendations for bylaws that we find are not in line with higher regulations and laws,” he said. Home Ministry spokesman Reydonnyzar Moenek said many of the bylaws contradicted a 1997 presidential decree on the distribution of liquor, based on alcoholic content. The decree says, drinks with less than 5 percent alcoholic content can be distributed without a license. However, he said, many bylaws also outlawed drinks with less than 5 percent alcoholic content. On Thursday, dozens of FPI and Islamic People’s Forum (FUI) members rallied in front of the Home Ministry in Jakarta and stoned the office, damaging office facilities. Protesters met with ministry officials on Friday to apologize for the violence. The ministry had filed a police report over the vandalism, Moenek said, despite the apology.

It was beyond our expectations,” FPI consultative council secretary Misbakhul Anam told ministry secretary-general Dian Anggraeni, as quoted by tempo.co. Misbakhul said that the FPI could not control its younger, militant members in what was intended to be a peaceful protest on alcoholic-beverage bylaws. “They are young, so they are full of emotion,” he said. However the ministry could have avoided the riot if it had met with the FPI earlier, Misbakhul said. Your comments: If they want to abstain from alcohol because of their religious commitments, then fine. No-one is forcing them. But please don’t interfere with my lifestyle. I like a drink every now and then. I am sure many of us do. My religion forbids the use of contraception, but I am faced with prominent displays of condoms every time I go to a drug store or minimart. No-one forces me to buy them so I do not protest. Live and let live, people. Is that so hard? Deedee S. Throw anyone in jail for sedition, violence and destruction of property. David K. Of course, you FPI leaders pass the buck and assume no responsibility for members of your group’s lawless actions.

"Fri, February 3 2012",Prosecutor caught red-handed in extortion,"Like something out of an action film, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and officers from the Riau Islands Police caught and arrested a prosecutor from the Batam Prosecutor’s Office in the act of accepting cash amounting to Rp 200 million (US$22,284) in bribe money. The prosecutor, identified as Jufrizal, was arrested at the Batam Industrial Development Authority (BIDA) office in Batam on Wednesday night after accepting the money, which was packed in an Indomie noodle box. Jufrizal, whom many onlookers thought was a thief, waved a firearm toward the people who were chasing him. The FPI Riau Islands’ advisory council coordinator, Nur Suparman, said on Thursday that the chain of events began when his son, Ali Akbar, was asked by prosecutors to pay them money in connection to the construction of one his development projects in Nongsa district. Ali told his father that the prosecutors had asked for Rp 400 million from the project’s total costs, which amounted to Rp 900 million, to be paid by the project’s consultancy, chaired by Ali, its contractor and staff from the local Public Works Agency. “After negotiations, the prosecutor who had requested the money agreed to be paid Rp 200 million in return for not bringing a case about the project to court,” Suparman said, without giving details about the case. “I told my son not to pay [the money]. If he had done so, it would have meant my son was guilty [of something],” Suparman said. A key point is that the project, which was financed from 2011 budget funds, had already been completed and handed over to the Batam City administration. Suparman said that the extortion case was later disclosed to FPI chairman Habib Rizieq when he visited Batam two days ahead of the arrest, at which point, the blackmailed parties agreed to foil the crooked prosecutors. For the collection, the prosecutors had assigned Jufrizal to fetch the money from Ali, in a handover scheduled to take place at 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday. At the time of the handover, Ali was monitored by 12 FPI members, as well as police officers in two parked cars not far from the BIDA park. Jufrizal later arrived by motorbike, followed by two cars containing his prosecutor colleagues. As soon as the money changed hands, the FPI members and police officers surrounded Jufrizal, who tried to run away. He threw down the box and ran in the direction of the Batam Center ferry port while waving his pistol. Jufrizal’s colleagues tried to retrieve him but failed and decided to flee. “They [prosecutors] sped off in the two cars as soon as Jufrizal was arrested,” Suparman said. The deputy director of Riau Islands’ Police detective unit, Adj. Comr. Wiyarso, said his subordinates were preparing reports on the extortion case. “We’re still questioning the suspect, witnesses and the victims,” he said. Head of the Batam Prosecutor’s Office special crimes section, Abdul Farid, said he had not received any notification from the police about the arrest. He admitted Jufrizal was one of the prosecutors at his office. “I met him at the office on Wednesday morning.

"Tue, February 7 2012",Attorney General acknowledges lurking ‘crooked prosecutors’,"Attorney General Basrief Arief acknowledged that “crooked prosecutors” who violated both regulations and ethics were still lurking in the profession. Speaking on the sidelines of his official visit to South Sulawesi’s Higher Prosecutor’s Office in Makassar on Monday, Basrief pointed to the most recent incident in Batam, Riau Islands, where a prosecutor was arrested for allegedly blackmailing a suspect in a corruption case he was working on. “This is, of course, very concerning for us all,” said Basrief. He said his office was continually correcting and improving the performance and morality of his staffers, by toughening up on supervision by their superiors. Once such prosecutors were revealed, he said, his office would investigate the seriousness of the violations committed. He said he needed to ensure they were held responsible for their violations. Sanctions would be imposed according to the severity of the violations. In response to the arrest of Batam prosecutor Jufrizal, Basrief said the investigation into his case was being conducted by the police. His office has also reportedly assigned an official to examine the case. An administrative sanction will be handed down if the prosecutor is found guilty. Previously, two heads of prosecutor’s offices in South Sulawesi were dismissed from their posts for allegedly accepting bribes from graft suspects. They were Rahmat Harianto, head of the Sinjai Prosecutor’s Office and Ridwan Umar, head of the Takalar Prosecutor’s Office. Separately, in Riau Islands, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) expressed disappointment over the handling of what they called the “blackmailing prosecutor case” by the local police and prosecutor’s office. They considered neither institution professional in handling the case, which they perceived as full of collusion, corruption and nepotism. Chairman of FPI’s Riau Islands branch, Hazarullah Aswad, accused the police and prosecutor’s office of twisting the facts in the case. Instead of continuing to process the case, he said, they summoned the blackmail victims — who happened to be FPI members — and tried to turn the case into an attempt to bribe the prosecutor by the FPI members. “We are protesting against it. The case has been twisted from a blackmail case into a bribery case,” Hazarullah told a press conference. The FPI and personnel from the Riau Islands Police caught Jufrizal, the prosecutor, red-handed on Wednesday evening in the act of receiving Rp 200 million in cash at a park in Batam. Apart from Jufrizal, three other prosecutors from the special crimes section of the Batam Prosecutor’s Office were present. In a separate case in Bandung, West Java, it has been reported that the indictment against prosecutor Sistoyo, who is alleged to have received a bribe of Rp 100 million, is to be handed over to the corruption court soon. “We will hand over the document this Thursday,” prosecutor Ketut Sumedana of the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) said in Bandung on Monday. Apart from Sistoyo, who worked at the Cibinong Prosecutor’s Office, the KPK named two other suspects in the case, namely Edward M Bunyamin and Anton Bambang Hadiyono. “They were caught red-handed,” Sumedana said. — Arya Dipa and Fadli contributed to the reports from Bandung and Batam",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/07/attorney-general-acknowledges-lurking-crooked-prosecutors.html,,2012
"Thu, February 9 2012",Notorious cleric reported for alleged sexual abuse,"The Jakarta Police said on Wednesday that they have been questioning the alleged victims of sexual abuse involving a well-known cleric in the capital, identified only as Habib H. “We are questioning 11 witnesses, all of whom are young men, who reported that they were victims of the abuse,” police spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto told reporters at the police headquarters. The report was filed by the families of the alleged victims on Dec. 16 last year. The police have yet to call Habib H in for questioning over the allegations. Chief general crimes detective, Sr. Comr. Gatot Edy Pramono, said that the police had yet to name Habib H a suspect in the case. “He’s not yet a suspect because the police are still investigating the case and gathering evidence,” he said as quoted by tribunnews.com. Habib H has allegedly been sexually abusing underage boys over a long period of time, starting in 2002. He allegedly groped the bodies of his disciples and performed oral sex on them in what he reported was part of an alternative healing therapy. Habib is an honorific title for the descendants of Prophet Muhammad. In Indonesia, the title is commonly used by clerics of Yemeni descent. The case over the alleged sexual abuse first gained attention after widespread reports on online forums and social media websites. The reports stated that the alleged abuse took place in Kampung Kandang in Jagakarsa, South Jakarta, where Habib had set up his own Islamic study group. The study group was among the largest in the capital that often held sermons in public places and blocked roads, which caused severe traffic congestion. According to the reports, the families of the alleged victims — aged between 14 and 19 — had reported the case to the Indonesia Ulema Council (MUI) and the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Habib H allegedly confessed to the abuse in front of the victims’ parents in mid-November, reportedly saying that his actions were in the name of his “holy guardianship”. Habib H is known to have close ties to FPI chief patron Habib Rizieq Shihab. FPI is a hard-line group notorious for its violent crackdowns on nightclubs and massage parlors that it deems sinful places. MUI chairman Amidhan Shaberah confirmed that the organization had received the alleged victims’ reports on Jan. 30. “However, we still have to clarify the reports [to Habib H] before making any statements,” he told The Jakarta Post over the phone. The FPI declined to comment on the matter, and Habib Rizieq did not respond to the Post’s calls and text messages. Rikwanto said that the police would seek the help of criminologists and linguistic experts to help them during the investigation. “We need help from linguistic experts to find out whether the terms used by Habib H in the alleged abuse can be used to charge him,” he said. The Criminal Code stipulates a penalty of seven years in prison for underage sexual abuse.

If the police don’t come along with us, we will do it on our own,” FPI Tangerang head Habib Muhammad bin Toha Assegaff said on Wednesday as quoted by tempo.co. “The stores are accessible to anyone, including children. They should not provide any alcoholic drinks,” he said. According to Assegaff, the open sale of alcohol has contributed to the recent rapes in Greater Jakarta. “Alcoholic beverages are closely related with adultery,” he said. The hard-line Muslim group previously criticized a 1997 presidential decree regulating alcohol sales, which said that beverages containing less than 5 percent alcohol could be sold without a license. Members of the FPI and Islamic People’s Forum (FUI) further rioted in front of the Home Ministry after it issued a regulation recommending that regional administrations annul local bylaws banning the consumption and distribution of alcoholic drinks.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/09/tangerang-fpi-raid-minimarkets-alcohol.html,,2012

"Sun, February 12 2012",Protesters reject senior FPI officials,"Hundreds of protesters from the local community in Palangkaraya, Central Kalimantan, staged a protest on Saturday at the Tjilik Riwut airport to block the arrival of four senior leaders of the Islamic hard-line group Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Some of the protesters, largely from the Dayak tribe, managed to force their way onto the airport’s apron and runway to search for the FPI officials, who came to Palangkaraya to inaugurate the organization’s provincial branch. Following the security breach, management of the airport ordered the FPI members to remain on board a Sriwijaya Air plane while other passengers disembarked. The four FPI members were then flown to Banjarmasin in South Kalimantan. The protesters dispersed only after they were assured by the airport operator that none of the FPI members had got off the plane. Initial reports said that FPI chairman Habib Rizieq Syihab, was on the plane. Secretary general of FPI Ahmad Sobri Lubis denied the report, saying that Rizieq was not bound for Palangkaraya. “Habib was not on the plane. He was in Jakarta and is currently ill,” Ahmad told The Jakarta Post in a telephone interview on Saturday. In fact, it was Ahmad Sobri, who led the four-person delegation toPalangkaraya. “I was the one who boarded the flight to Palangkaraya,” he said. He confirmed that there were three other senior members of FPI on the plane, who later ended their journey in Banjarmasin. “The plane was surrounded by Dayaks at the [Tjilik Riwut] airport,” Ahmad said. Ahmad said the four FPI members were going to attend a mass prayer in the city and the inauguration of a provincial chapter of the organization, headquartered in Palangkaraya. Lucas Tingkes, deputy chairman of the Central Kalimantan Dayak Tribe Council (DAD) said that the organization had asked the Central Kalimantan Police to ban the FPI provincial chapter. “We have concerns that FPI’s presence will create tension because the organization’s activities often create anxiety among members of the community. “Central Kalimantan is known as a place conducive to religious harmony,” he said as quoted by Antara newswire. In 2001, more than 400 people were killed and over 50,000 others were displaced in ethnic- and religious-based conflict between native Dayaks and migrant Madurese settlers in Palangkaraya, as well as in Sampit in Central Kalimantan. Chairman of the Indonesia Dayak Youth Movement of Central Kalimantan, Yansen A. Binti, said that FPI was not welcome in Central Kalimantan. He said that there were already interfaith organizations including the Inter-Religious Harmony Forum (FKUB), Regional Intelligence Community (Kominda) and the Early Awareness Society Forum (FKDM). “All those organizations seek to preserve and maintain harmonious relations among religions in Central Kalimantan. So FPI is not needed here, particularly because it has been on the news promoting violence,” he said. In a press statement made later on Saturday, Rizieq said that he had instructed all FPI members in Kalimantan not to be provoked by the incident. “All this time, the relationship between FPI and both the Muslim and non-Muslim Dayak communities has been very good,” he said. He put the blame for the incident on Central Kalimantan Governor Agustin Teras Narang who, he claimed, had an “extremely bad” attitude to FPI. He also said that Yansen — who, he believed, was related to Teras — had made threats against his organization and convinced locals to reject FPI. In 2008, following opposition from the majority Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) community, the FPI branch in Jember, East Java had to disband.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/12/protesters-reject-senior-fpi-officials.html,,2012

Ismail said further that rejecting the presence of FPI in their city was Central Kalimantan residents way of expressing disappointment to the state, which appears indecisive when it comes to intolerant majority groups. “The state ignores such groups and lets them act freely with their violent acts here and there. Leaders of this country must see the rejection as a call to be stricter with violent groups to really maintain religious harmony in Indonesia,” Ismail added.

"Mon, February 13 2012",Leaders demand that govt guarantee religious freedom,"As religious leaders celebrated what is known as World Interfaith Harmony Week here on Sunday, the Indonesian Christian Church (GKI) Yasmin congregation was still prevented from holding religious services in their Bogor church. On Sunday, dozens of congregation members held a service, presided over by Rev. Ujang Tanusaputra, in front of the State Palace in a gesture seeking government help. “This is our way of showing our concerns for this country. We’ve been barred from our church for months. Our house of worship is sealed,” said GKI Yasmin spokesman Dwiati Novita Rini after the service. Bogor Mayor Diani Budiarto has banned the congregation from using the church for religious services due to permit application issues. The administration has defied a 2010 Supreme Court ruling guaranteeing the congregation’s right to hold services at the church. Dwiati said GKI Yasmin church had been sealed and locked since 2010 and the congregation resorted to conducting services on the pavement in front of the church complex. Responding to this lengthy standoff between GKI Yasmin and the Bogor administration, Indonesia’s Interreligious Council (IRC) chairman Din Syamsuddin said on Sunday the government should guarantee the rights of all religious groups. He also called on all religious groups to refrain from violence. “I am really concerned about the current condition of [Indonesian] religious groups. The government has failed to protect [the groups] when practicing their respective religious beliefs,” he said on the sidelines of the World Interfaith Harmony Week meeting in Jakarta. The government, he added, should handle the problems seriously. Otherwise, religious-related violence would continue to occur. Recently the Ahmadiyah sect, which the government considers deviant, was subject to violence. The Shiite community in Sampang, Madura, was also the target of attacks from a nearby Muslim community. The repeated violence against religious followers has shown up a lack of state action in its failure to protect citizens from attacks by others. Furthermore, Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali recently called the Shiites heretical, a statement that could be used by hard line organizations to attack the groups. Meanwhile, in opposition to the presence of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), which has used violence on occasion, residents in Palangkaraya in Central Kalimantan staged a protest at the province’s Tjilik Riwut airport on Saturday. They objected to four senior FPI leaders, who were scheduled to inaugurate the organization’s provincial branch in the city. The protesters alleged that the FPI often conducted violent acts against minority groups in the name of Islam. Din Syamsuddin, who is also the chairman of Indonesia’s second-largest Muslim organization, Muhammadiyah, said that religious mass organizations also had the right to exist as long as they did not resort to violence. “I’m not talking about specific groups, but in general they have the right to exist, the right to speak up. However, they can only do that under one condition: they should be nonviolent,” he said. He added that many mass organizations were needed in Indonesia because they contributed to the country, referring to Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah. Several religious leaders attended the celebration of World Interfaith Harmony Week on Sunday. Among them were Andreas Yewangoe of the Indonesian Conference of Churches, I Nyoman Udayana of the Indonesian Hindu Organization, Philip Wijaya of the High Buddhist Council and Wawan Wiratma of the Confucian group Matakin. All of the leaders agreed that interfaith dialogue was important to promote peace and harmony despite religious differences. I Nyoman Udayana said that all human beings were the same before God. “It is only good or bad [deeds] that will differentiate us. Therefore, all human beings should live in harmony and diversity,” Nyoman said. He added that although religious rights were stipulated in law, in practice the government should not discriminate against any minority group. Din Syamsuddin said that there were no religions in Indonesia that opposed diversity, “Stop looking at what is different, start looking at our similarities in order to live in peace and harmony.” World Interfaith Harmony Week was declared by United Nations General Assembly in 2011 and is celebrated in the first week of February.

"Tue, February 14 2012",‘Tjilik Riwut strategy’ to guard indigenous harmony,"There is now an effective strategy to combat religious violence and the influence of violent groups: Surround their plane and prohibit propagators of violence from disembarking and stepping foot on your land. This strategy can also be metaphorical: Surround the carriers of violence, prevent inciters of violence from spreading influence in your land to destroy the long-standing tradition of tolerance. This strategy can be called the “Tjilik Riwut” strategy; a strategy demonstrated by local Dayak protesters who refused to permit the presence of an organization that often incites violence, disharmony and intimidation in many parts of Indonesia. Motivated by the desire to protect indigenous peace and religious harmony in Central Kalimantan, local protesters surrounded a plane carrying four senior officials of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) who had come there to inaugurate a branch of their organization in Central Kalimatan. The four FPI elites were eventually forced by local authorities to fly to Banjarmasin. Commenting on the incident, a colleague said, “Imagine if in Banjarmasin they were surrounded by another mob and were forced to fly to Jakarta. And if in Jakarta they were surrounded by another mob. Perhaps such a strategy will end the violence, intimidation and the raids of this organization against religious minorities.” A similar case occurred in 2008. Banser, the youth wing of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), dissolved the branch of the organization in Jember, East Java, after the paramilitary organization insulted Gus Dur, then chief patron of NU, and attacked peaceful protesters in National Monument (Monas), Central Jakarta, celebrating the anniversary of Pancasila. Enraged by the insult, Banser also raided FPI members in Lamongan, East Java, and “marked” individuals who had become members of the FPI after the incident in Monas. At the same time, the National Declaration Movement was initiated in Bali and was dedicated to shielding the nation from the rising influence of radicalism. The rejections of the Dayak community in Kalimantan, Muslims and non-Muslims in Bali, Java and many other areas in Indonesia make sense. Indonesian communities — Muslims and non-Muslims — are fed up with the organization, which has incited violence in the name of religion, but still remains untouchable. Violent organizations, or organized thugs, are a real challenge to state authorities. When the state seems to be powerless against vigilantes, people will move to protect their dignity. Since its declaration in 1998, the FPI has set upon systematic nationwide acts of violence. It has incited many vigilante actions against, among others, Ahmadiyah followers and the congregation of the HKBP Church in Bekasi, West Java. Rather than maintaining a marginal image, violence, including coercion, intimidation, raids, destruction of property and violence, has been the central strategic aspects of the FPI movement. The FPI has been willing to use violence and intimidation as its main tactics in building influence. Not only non-Muslims, Muslims alike are also the targets of the FPI. The FPI has intimidated activists from the Islamic Liberal Network (JIL), attacked peaceful protesters celebrating religious freedom in Monas, and damaged statues in public spaces that they deemed un-Islamic. In Purwakarta, West Java, statues representing characters of widely popular local puppet theater, such as Bima, Werkudara and Janaka, were destroyed. The FPI’s main activities traditionally focused on raiding night clubs selling alcohol. The activities of the organization, however, have been expanded to intervention in conflicts over places of worship in Jakarta and its surrounding areas. The most recent case was the damage caused to the front entrance of Home Ministry. The activities reveal that there has been a major ideological transformation within the organization. It was first in the form of the Pamswakarsa militia created by the Indonesian Military (TNI) during the reformasi era to guard the peaceful transition to democracy, but was only centered in Jakarta. The organization, however, has become a very active organization and is widespread across the country. Researchers, such as Zachary Abuza, estimate that the FPI claims about 100,000 members and has branches in 22 provinces. According to Ian Wilson, since 2003 the FPI has transformed itself from “an unruly bunch of thugs in religious garb” to “a far more disciplined and ideologically oriented paramilitary force”. What needs to be considered given such a transformation is that the new terrorists grew out of vigilantism, as exemplified in the case of Ahmad Syarip, the suicide bomber of a mosque in Cirebon. Syarip had been actively involved in the raids against alcohol and in intimidation against Ahmadiyah followers. Moral reasoning has been the argument often used by the organization to justify its actions. But the transformation has illustrated that the organization was no longer the organization as we knew it during the New Order era. It is now an organization which confidently uses violence. That is why it threatens the foundational principles of a secular democratic state. Moreover, in its mission statement, it is stated that the organization is dedicated to the complete implementation of sharia (kaffah). Analyzing violent groups in the post-New Order Indonesia, Ian Wilson observed that paramilitary groups, such as the FPI, are a major challenge to restoring confidence in state institutions. To restore public trust in state institutions, the government should have a clear cut action plan to deal with violent organizations. Grown out of the Pamswakarsa, the FPI previously received support from the Jakarta Police and the TNI commander at that time: Gen. Wiranto. The links between certain elites and the FPI have been a source of FPI confidence. The elites have nothing to do with religion, but their interest in the FPI is related to jockeying for political influence. The strength of the FPI represents the weaknesses of the government against violent organizations and the elites behind them. “Surrounding the Tjilik Riwut plane strategy” is an expression of civil frustration against the ignorance of the central government in guarding long-standing religious tolerance and freedom. They are tired of language games played by the certain Jakarta elites in regard to these organizations. In response to the ban in Central Kalimantan, the FPI elites said that the event “could potentially cause horizontal conflict and threaten the stability of the nation”. They also say that freedom of expression is not protected here. These statements are more relevant if addressed to the organization itself, rather than the Dayak protesters. To protect religious harmony, the state could adopt the Tjilik Riwut strategy by suppressing the trend of religious violence through compulsory adherence of every organization to the guiding principles of Pancasila. This strategy could at least curb radical organizations from gathering further political influence.

"Tue, February 14 2012",Editorial: Against each other,"Chaos on the brink of anarchy colored another day in the republic when protesters in Palangkaraya, Central Kalimantan, forced their way onto the airport’s apron and runway on Friday. Reported to be largely members of the local Dayak tribe, they said they were searching for officials of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) who were scheduled to inaugurate the organization’s provincial branch in the province. Following the security breach, the airport management ordered the FPI members to remain on board the airplane, and they were later flown to Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan. On Sunday, the provincial branch of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) stated that the establishment of the Palangkaraya FPI branch had been canceled, citing the opposition of the local Dayak community. The FPI has demanded a thorough investigation into the blocking of the airport and rejection of only four of their senior leaders on board the plane, pointing their fingers at the governor himself, Teras Narang, and citing the “very close” relationship between the FPI and Muslim Dayaks in the area. They have raised valid questions over why the armed crowd was able to enter the airport up to “about 50 meters” from the Sriwijaya Air flight. The incident is far from a good promotion for Kalimantan as a whole, where violence erupted barely 13 years ago in neighboring West Kalimantan, in which hundreds of residents were killed and over 100,000 displaced, mostly Madurese migrants from East Java. On a much smaller scale of conflict, in 2010 the Dayak tribe in Tarakan, East Kalimantan, took the blame again for unrest. Thus residents, who may still be learning to live peacefully despite differences, want no more trouble if they can help it. Residents outside the Dayak community in Central Kalimantan may have quietly supported the airport blockade, however alarming the security breach. And regardless of a conspiracy involving the Central Kalimantan elite, as the FPI accuses, and a clear inability to keep peace and order on the part of security officers, what the FPI may have forgotten is that they might face rejection elsewhere, though not on a similar frontal and massive scale. However noble its intentions might be against fighting evil and promoting good, the FPI’s vigilante style has brought it a bad name even among those who are not likely on its target list. It is not only the FPI; similar groups have taken on the vigilante role that appeals to some and repels many too. Whoever is behind such groups, their appeal lies in the heroic notion of being able to make a difference for the social good — even if people aren’t grateful. The appeal stems from the gap in law enforcement that is evident everywhere. And in such a situation, it’s “us against them”, a fertile ground for horizontal conflict as security personnel stand by. We cringe as scholars describe how Indonesia’s history has been shaped by violence in each struggle for power, as if we’re a bunch of barbarians. But we wouldn’t be surprised either, if the blockade of the Tjilik Riwut Airport is not the last of its kind.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/14/editorial-against-each-other.html,,2012
"Tue, February 14 2012",Old law shields violent group FPI from sanctions,"Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi says the Law on Mass Organizations is outdated and is preventing the ministry from taking action against violent and vigilante groups. Gamawan urged the House to speed its protracted deliberations on revising the law. “The sanctions against violent mass organizations in the 1985 law are too complicated, time consuming and not efficient [to impose]. I want this law to be amended to accommodate simpler procedures to take decisive actions against violent mass organizations,” Gamawan said on Monday. While the minister maintained that the revision was driven by necessity, critics claimed that Fauzi was responding to public pressure to disband groups, such as the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), whose members have frequently engaged in violence and vigilantism. Meanwhile, several NGOs have opposed revising the law, fearing a threat to their constitutional rights or interference with law-abiding civil society organizations. Gamawan dismissed naysayers, claiming a revised law would better protect people’s right to assembly and the freedom of speech. On a separate issue, the minister said he supported Central Kalimantan Governor Agustin Teras Narang’s efforts to broker a dialog following an incident involving the FPI over the weekend. “I heard that the governor will hold a forum involving local religious leaders, representatives from customary groups and the Indonesian Ulema Council to respond the incident. I think that will be a good step and I support it,” Gamawan, who was previously West Sumatra governor, said. Gamawan referred to events on Saturday, when hundreds of members of the local Dayak community stormed the runway at Tjilik Riwut Airport in Palangkaraya to block the arrival of four FPI members who came to Central Kalimantan to inaugurate a local branch. As the crowd rallied on the tarmac, airport management ordered the FPI members to remain on board their Sriwijaya Air flight while other passengers disembarked. The FPI members were not allowed to disembark and then flown directly to Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan. Separately, the FPI filed a report with the National Police over the incident on Monday. In their complaint, the FPI alleged that four men — the governor; Lukas Tingkes, a relative of the governor; and local youth activists Yansen Binti and Sabran Sukron conspired to organize the airport protest to cover up what they said were “local crimes”. “The masses have threatened to kill us here in the same place they burned down a stage that was provided for us by those who invited us,” Munarman of the FPI said. Munarman, a former director of the Legal Aid Institute (LBH), also claimed that he had evidence proving that the FPI members were blocked from visiting Central Kalimantan to stop the group from aiding local residents whose indigenous land had been seized by private companies linked to Governor Agustin.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/14/old-law-shields-violent-group-fpi-sanctions.html,,2012
"Wed, February 15 2012",No love shown to the FPI,"A group uniting under the banner of “Indonesia-without-the-FPI” staged a rally around the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle on Tuesday afternoon, demanding the government disband the hard-line group Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Traffic was held up in all directions for more than an hour, as 250 police officers protecting the protest had trouble with crowd control. “We do not represent any organization. We are merely ordinary citizens who have had enough with all the violent and repressive acts carried out by the FPI in the name of Islam,” rally spokesperson Vivi Widyawati told reporters. The FPI is a hard-line group notorious for its violent crackdowns on nightclubs and massage parlors, which it deems “sinful places”. Vivi said that the rally was held in response to a similar protest held in Palangkaraya, Central Kalimantan, on Saturday, when hundreds of protesters, mostly from the Dayak tribe, staged a demonstration at the Tjilik Riwut Airport to block the arrival of four senior FPI leaders intending to inaugurate a local branch. “We fully support the Dayak tribe’s decision. If they can drive FPI out of Palangkaraya, so can we,” Vivi said. Despite repeated calls on the government to disband the FPI, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has brushed off allegations that the government was reluctant to take action against vigilante groups. During an interview with journalists at the State Palace on Monday, which was aired live by several national TV stations, a reporter asked why the President seemed to be indecisive when it came to matters related to the FPI, such as calls for their disbandment. The President, who referred to the FPI as “our brothers”, only said that legal action should be taken against anyone, be they FPI or others, who used violence. This has been Yudhoyono’s standard answer and many analysts regard it as a sign of indecisiveness or a reluctance to take on sensitive issues. “Concerning the incident in Palangkaraya, our brothers in the FPI should ask themselves why other organizations are allowed to be established there while they are rejected?” Yudhoyono said. “Any organization can hold activities wherever they want in Indonesia, as long as they do not violate the law. Officials and law enforcers in Central Kalimantan must be prudent. Saturday’s incident might have been provoked by certain parties,” the President said. Protesters started to arrive at the traffic circle at about 3.30 p.m. The demonstration itself began at 4 p.m. and went on for around an hour, before protesters dispersed. Banners bearing strongly worded messages urging the FPI’s disbandment were held up by the protesters. “Condemn violence in the name of religion. Indonesia without the FPI!” said one of the banners. “The state must not kneel before cloaked hoodlums,” said another. A more tongue-in-cheek banner read “A Valentine’s gift for Habib Rizieq,” referring to FPI leader Habib Rizieq Shihab. One of the protesters brought a smaller version of this message and a pink stuffed toy pig. Well-known film and stage actress Jajang C. Noer, noted director Hanung Bramantyo, and activist Alissa Wahid, the daughter of former president Abdurrahman Wahid, were among the protesters. “Islam does not need defending. God does not need defending. What Indonesia needs right now is peace. Stop the violence and stop judging others without reason,” Jajang said. Meanwhile, Hanung demanded that those who called themselves intellects and moderates stood up for themselves. “Show these violent organizations who are the real majority,” he said. According to Hanung, the FPI is only a minority among Indonesian Muslims. “Don’t let the FPI act as if they’re the majority. The silent majority must make their voice heard.” The protest took a violent turn when one of its coordinators, identified as Bhagavad Sambada, was attacked by an unidentified man. The attacker then grabbed one of the protest banners and trampled on it, inciting the anger of many of the protesters. The attacker was heard saying “Valentine is haram! Valentine is haram!” before attacking Bhagavad. Haram is an Islamic term meaning “forbidden” and is used to refer to anything that is considered unlawful or prohibited by God. Six men were taken into custody following the chaotic incident, including Bhagavad and another protester identified as Bandi. The other four were unidentified. Bhagavad was released later in the evening, while the other five were detained by the Jakarta Police for questioning. “We do not know who the other four are. They were not part of the protest,” said Tunggal Prawesti, another spokesperson for the rally. The police were unavailable for comment. Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto did not respond to calls or text messages from The Jakarta Post.

"Thu, February 16 2012",FPI sympathizer charged with sudden attack,"The Jakarta Police said on Wednesday that they had detained four men involved in Tuesday afternoon’s protest at the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle, where protesters demanded the disbandment of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI). “Only one of them, 48-year-old J, has been named a suspect in the case,” police spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto told reporters. The police said that all the four detainees were FPI sympathizers, as a lawyer from the notorious organization had visited the police headquarters to assist them with the legal process. Tuesday’s protest took a violent turn when one of its coordinators, identified as Bhagavad Sambada, was suddenly attacked by a then-unidentified man. The attacker then grabbed one of the protest banners and trampled on it, inciting the anger of many of the protesters. Six men were taken into custody later in the evening, including Bhagavad and another protester identified as Bandi. Bhagavad and Bandi were released on Tuesday night after the police finished questioning them. Rikwanto said that video recordings of the incident made by local television stations clearly proved that J had attacked Bhagavad. Police questioning of J found that he attacked Bhagavad upon seeing one of the protest banners bearing the words “A Valentine Gift for Habib Rizieq”. J has been charged under Article 170 of the Criminal Code on forceful attack with the intent to inflict harm. He may face seven years in prison if found guilty. The other three detainees were identified as 24-year-old A, 23-year-old B, and 44-year-old S. “They were detained on the grounds of Bhagavad’s statements during questioning that they had also attacked him,” said Rikwanto. Women’s rights activist Tunggal Prawesti, who served as the spokesperson of Tuesday’s rally, told The Jakarta Post that the protesters would oversee the ongoing legal process to ensure that justice would be served. Rikwanto said that the police had received numerous public complaints regarding violent incidents involving members of mass organizations, including the FPI. “However, we don’t have the authority to disband them. We can only state the facts. There have been numerous complaints of these organizations. It’s up to the Home Ministry to do something based on these facts,” he said. Separately, Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi said that the ministry would not hesitate to freeze mass organizations such as the FPI if they kept disrupting public safety. According to him, his ministry had sent the FPI two warning letters, the latest of which was sent after the group vandalized the ministry’s office in Central Jakarta last month. Meanwhile, the FPI said that the state had no reason to freeze the organization. “There is nothing to evaluate [in terms of the FPI’s existence]. The pressure [to disband the FPI] makes no sense,” senior FPI member Habib Muhsin Ahmad Alatas said, as quoted by kompas.com.

"Fri, February 17 2012",Hundreds come out to protest against demands to ban FPI,"While protests demanding the disbandment of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) have been flaring in other cities, about 200 other people claiming to be members of various Muslim organizations requested to opposite at a rally in Surakarta, Central Java, on Thursday afternoon. Declaring to be grouped under the Surakarta Muslim Paramilitary Troop (LUIS), which the FPI is a member of, they held the rally in front of the Surakarta Police headquarters to reject demands for the disbandment of the FPI voiced at other protests. They could not enter the headquarters due to a security barricade. Some protesters were allowed to go inside to talk to the police. “We just asked the police to pass our message on to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono through the National Police chief,” said Khoirul Suparjo, the chairman of the FPI’s Surakarta branch. Khoirul, who was among the representatives allowed inside, said that the protesters wanted the President to continue allowing them to unite and gather as a group of Indonesian citizens. Khoirul denied that the protest was deliberately conducted to coincide with the President’s official visit to the greater Surakarta region. “It is just a coincidence,” he said. The President arrived in Surakarta on Thursday morning, and continued onto Sragen regency to visit a pre-historic human being held in a museum in Sangiran. He was accompanied by 11 ministers and Central Java Governor Bibit Waluyo. He reportedly spent the previous night in Surakarta and attended a morning harvest ceremony in Sragen. Separately, Surakarta Police chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Ahmad Luthfi told reporters that FPI members spoke to police during the meeting and handed over a letter addressed to the National Police chief. “There was nothing special about the meeting.

"Sat, February 18 2012","Bowing to pressure, FPI pledges to leave violence behind","The Islam Defenders Front (FPI), a hard-liner group that has been under the spotlight recently as its promotion of violence has begun to meet resistance from community groups, has committed to changing its ways. The group’s leader Rizieq Shihab said during his visit to the Religious Affairs Ministry on Friday that FPI would fight for justice and corruption eradication through peaceful means. “The incident at the Home Ministry and various others incidents are no longer the group’s hallmark. FPI has left that paradigm,” he said as quoted by Antara news agency. FPI members were involved in vandalizing the Home Ministry office in Jakarta during its protest last month, prompting the ministry to issue its final warning before taking action to suspend the group. As its grasp on public sympathies has begun to slip, various community groups have begun standing up to the FPI, including a notable protest initiated by the Dayak ethnic group at Tjilik Riwut Airport last week to block FPI leaders’ arrival. Commenting on the rejection, Rizieq said he came to the province to preach and to reveal a corruption case in the province. In a statement posted on the organization’s website, Rizieq accused Central Kalimantan Governor Agustin Teras Narang, a politician from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), of having orchestrated the attack. The FPI has filed a report to the National Police against five individuals: Central Kalimantan Governor Agustin Teras Narang, Narang’s relative Lukas Tingkes, local youth figure Yansen Binti and Sabran Sukron as those behind the local community’s protest on Monday against the FPI’s move to open a new regional branch office in the area. The FPI said the protest was organized to cover up local crimes. FPI spokesman Munarman accused the Democratic Party as being behind the recent anti-FPI rally in Jakarta, saying that it tried to divert public attention from corruption cases implicating the party’s politicians. “Who attended the event? [It was attended by] one of the members of Democratic Party, Ulil Abshar Abdalla. He’s the one who initiated the rally. He tried to divert the public’s attention from national issues,” Munarman said on Friday as quoted by kompas.com. Munarman accused the Democratic Party of taking revenge after the FPI conducted several rallies in front of the house of party chairman Anas Urbaningrum in East Jakarta, related to a corruption case that he has been implicated in. Democratic Party lawmaker Sutan Bhatoegana denied the allegation. “It has nothing to do with diverting public attention. Munarman should not bring about the Democratic Party in this issue. Ulil did not participate on behalf of the party. Let’s just mind our own business,” Sutan said. Earlier this week, Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi said that the government could disband FPI if it received the third warning letter from his ministry. Gamawan said that the ministry had so far sent two reprimands to the FPI for the security problems posed by its violent actions. “If they keep on breaking the law, we will certainly freeze them in accordance with the 1985 law on mass organizations,” Gamawan said. Meanwhile, in Bandung, West Java, Muslim groups staged a rally to defend the FPI. A Muslim organization named the Islam Reform Movement (Garis) said that calls for the disbandment of the FPI were made by infidels and liberal politicians. “They are trying to discredit Muslim organizations in the country,” Garis chairman Chep Hermawan said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/18/bowing-pressure-fpi-pledges-leave-violence-behind.html,,2012

"Sun, February 19 2012",The week in review: Imagine: RI without the FPI,"The infamous Islam Defenders Front (FPI) had a hard lesson to learn in Central Kalimantan last week when its visiting senior leaders were blocked by some 800 hostile indigenous Dayak tribespeople at the airport. Many brandishing daggers and arrows, the angry people stormed the Tjilik Riwut airport in the provincial capital of Palangka Raya. They forced the Sriwijaya aircraft arriving from Jakarta to drop every passenger but four of the FPI’s leaders whose mission was to open an FPI branch office in the province. The Dayak insisted the FPI is not welcome in Central Kalimantan, where Muslims, Catholics, Protestants, Buddhists, Hindus and animists have lived peacefully side by side for centuries. They fear that the FPI would introduce its notorious culture of violence in the province. Local media identified the four FPI leaders as secretary general Sobri Lubis, deputy chief Muchsin Al-Attas, propagation chief Awit Masyhuri and military wing commander Maman Suryadi Abdurrahman. Thanks largely to the police and airport authorities’ quick and appropriate response, no violence occurred. The Sriwijaya aircraft soon departed, rerouting the rejected leaders to the neighboring Banjarmasin airport, where they were reportedly stranded for lack of the return tickets. The incident has put the FPI, which has become the face of radical Islamic movements in Indonesia since the fall of dictator Soeharto in 1998, in an unprecedented spotlight. Critics of the group were delighted to see that eventually somebody stood up to the group, especially when police have rarely taken serious action when members of this vigilante group have committed acts of violence in the name of Islam. On its part, the FPI accused the “infidel” Dayak of attempting to murder its leaders and trampling on other citizens’ rights to organize. It also filed a criminal report with the National Police against Central Kalimantan Governor Teras Narang and police chief Brig. Gen. Damianus Zacky whom they accused of orchestrating the Dayak’s unruly protest. While the way the Dayaks demonstrated their rejection of the FPI was regrettable, it has given peace-loving citizens new momentum to press forward with their demands for the dissolution of the FPI. A rare anti-FPI demonstration was organized in Jakarta, which almost predictably was attacked by FPI supporters. Those who share the “Indonesia without the FPI” sentiment but mean to play it safe, have taken their aspirations to cyberspace. In fact, Central Kalimantan is not the first area to have rejected the FPI. Last year, an alliance of moderate Muslim groups in Jombang, East Java, also rejected the FPI in their midst for fear that its ideology would poison the locals’ minds. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who has yet to make good his pledge to disband violent groups, said the Dayaks’ rejection should serve as an opportunity for the FPI to do some introspection. Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi, whose office complex was attacked by FPI members protesting his policy on liquor sales, earlier this month threatened to “freeze” the organization if it doesn’t behave. It’s high time for the FPI to uphold its slogan, “Live honorably” by respecting others. *** Democratic Party lawmaker Angelina Sondakh’s testimony in the Jakarta Corruption Court on Wednesday – her fist since the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) named her a suspect in the 2011 SEA Games village development project in Palembang – raised some eyebrows. The former Miss Indonesia testified at the trial of her estranged political bedfellow, Muhammad Nazaruddin, to details related to the same case. Nazaruddin has been charged with accepting Rp 4.6 billion from the project. He has accused Angelina of playing an intermediary role between the House’s Commission X overseeing youth and sports affairs, the government and project contractors. In her testimony, Angelina denied any involvement in the appointment of contractors for the Rp 191 billion project, let alone benefiting from it as charged. She denied collaborating with Mindo Rosalina Manulang, then marketing director of PT Anak Negeri, a company controlled by Nazaruddin in the center of the corruption scandal, although transcripts of their conversations have been widely circulated. Nazaruddin has accused Angelina of accepting Rp 9 billion from the Sports and Youth Affairs Ministry in “grease” money for House Commission X members to secure their political support for the project. Unconvinced by her testimony, Nazaruddin has planned to file a police report for Angelina’s alleged perjury. Angelina’s denials are believed to be a tactic to “fortify” senior Democratic Party officials in the scandal, especially chairman Anas Urbaningrum, whose alleged involvement in the scandal has often been mentioned in previous trials. Her bizarre denials of knowledge, let alone involvement, of basic issues surrounding the high profile scandal, as uncovered by numerous witnesses and suspects, have surprised not only the public but also brought to the open factional rivalries within the Democratic Party. Anas’ political foes, personified by Nazaruddin, have sought full disclosure of party officials’ involvement in the scandal. They also want to see Anas voluntarily resign and face a KPK investigation. Meanwhile, supporters in Anas’ camp are doing everything to contain the political damage to Nazaruddin, who has been blamed for the Democrats’ plummeting levels of popularity. In the meantime, the KPK is yet to arrest Angelina or summon Anas, who has vehemently denied any involvement in the SEA Games saga, for questioning.

"Mon, February 20 2012","Issues of the day: We are here to stay, say FPI","Feb. 15, Online In the face of many calls to freeze the activities of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), the hard-line group remained firm that they were here to stay. Al-Habib Mushin Ahmad Alattas, the FPI’s campaign and interfaith relations chief, said that calls to disband the group were irrational. “We don’t have to evaluate anything, because all the calls to disband us are nonsense. They don’t have any right to dissolve us,” he said as quoted by kompas.com on Wednesday. Alattas was one of the 17 people grouped under the Islamic Umat Forum who complained to House of Representatives’ Commission III overseeing legal affairs and laws, human rights and security about the recent rejection of four FPI senior leaders by residents of Central Kalimantan. Around 800 protesters, mostly from the Dayak ethnic group, staged a rally on Feb. 11 at Tjilik Riwut Airport in Palangkaraya to block the FPI leaders’ arrival. The rally inspired 100 people, uniting under the banner of “Indonesia-without-the-FPI”, to stage a rally in Jakarta on Tuesday afternoon, demanding the government disband the FPI. Your comments: If truly devout Muslims, out of misplaced fear, do not choose to act decisively to condemn the actions of the FPI and to disband it, then they are responsible, and will be the cause of increasing ill-will against Islam, which calls itself “The Religion of Peace”. Ultimately, at the time they stand before Allah’s Throne, they will be held responsible by Him.

"Mon, February 20 2012",Police to question noted cleric over sexual abuse,"The Jakarta Police will summon Hasan bin Ja’afar Assegaf, an influential cleric accused of sexually abusing some of his male students. “We must watch our every step carefully. Right now, we have questioned 11 victims and plan to examine their psychological state and determine the validity of their reports,” Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto said on Saturday. He said that once the police felt that they had solid evidence, they would summon Hasan for questioning. “If he is indeed the perpetrator, then he will face hard time, thus give us room to complete the preliminary examinations first,” he said. Hasan has allegedly been sexually abusing underage boys over a long period of time, starting in 2002. He allegedly groped his disciples and performed oral sex on them in what he claimed was part of an alternative healing therapy. The victims filed reports with the Jakarta Police last December. Besides filing a report with the police, the victims also filed reports with the Indonesian Children Protection Commission (KPAI). Following the report, the KPAI summoned Hasan Assegaf on Feb. 13 but he failed to appear. The case began when Hasan sent a letter to his fellow religious teacher because she had prohibited her students from joining in Hasan’s group. Instead of answering the letter, the other teacher told the public that Hasan had sexually abused his students. The case over the alleged sexual abuse first gained attention after widespread reports on online forums and social media websites. The reports stated that the alleged abuse took place in Kampung Kandang in Jagakarsa, South Jakarta, where Hasan had set up his own Islamic study group. The study group was among the largest in the capital, often holding sermons in public places and blocking roads, which caused severe traffic congestion. According to the reports, the families of the alleged victims — aged between 14 and 19 — had reported the case to the Indonesia Ulema Council (MUI) and the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Hasan allegedly confessed to the abuse in front of the victims’ parents in mid-November, reportedly saying that his actions were in the name of his “holy guardianship”. He is known to have close ties to FPI chief patron Habib Rizieq Shihab. The FPI is a hard-line group notorious for its violent crackdowns on nightclubs and massage parlors, which it considers sinful places. MUI chairman Amidhan Shaberah previously confirmed that the organization had received the alleged victims’ reports on Jan. 30. “However, we still have to clarify the reports with Hasan before making any statements,” he said. The FPI declined to comment on the matter, and Habib did not respond to the Post’s calls and text messages. Rikwanto said that the police would seek the help of criminologists and linguistic experts to help them during the investigation. “We need help from linguistic experts to find out whether the terms used by Hasan in the alleged abuse can be used to charge him,” he said. The Criminal Code stipulates a penalty of seven years in prison for underage sexual abuse.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/20/police-question-noted-cleric-over-sexual-abuse.html,,2012
"Mon, February 20 2012",Calls for govt to boost policing to deter groups using violence,"Several mass organization (Ormas) leaders have called on the government to boost law enforcement to deter organizations from employing violence, adding that disbanding organizations was not a solution. Law enforcement would also prevent the potential anarchy that followed any disbandment of organizations, they said. “Restricting [the presence of] mass organizations will be a human rights violation. It breaches the right to assemble,” said Saleh Daulay, chairman of Muhammadiyah’s youth-wing organization. Saleh was speaking at a seminar on Saturday discussing the Mass Organization bill. He added that poor law enforcement had opened the door to violent groups such as the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), to impose its power on others. “It seems today that the FPI has greater power than law enforcers, even than the President. The FPI would not have such courage to freely conduct violent acts had law enforcers used the Criminal Code (KUHP) to punish those comitting violence,” Saleh added. The violent measures frequently practiced by the FPI, Saleh said, should not be used by lawmakers as a pretext to repress mass organizations across the country. The deliberation of the Mass Organization bill has attracted public attention following the rejection by Central Kalimantan residents, mostly from the Dayak tribe, of the FPI plan to open a chapter in the province. Local residents staged a demonstration at Tjilik Riwut Airport on Feb. 11 to prevent FPI leaders from coming to the city of Palangkaraya. Following the incidence, the East Java chapter of Banser and GP Ansor, the youth wing of Indonesia’s largest Islamic group, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), urged the government to suspend or disband all mass organizations that use violence. The FPI is widely known for its use of violence in pushing its ideas. FPI legal staff member Hasbi Ibrohim said disbanding mass organizations such as the FPI in order to curb anarchy would not resolve the core problem, which according to Hasbi was poverty. “We can easily make a new organization if we are disbanded by the government. Moreover, the FPI would not bother do what it has been doing had law enforcers, the police particular, fulfilled their responsibilities. They fail to uphold justice by protecting corruptors who participate in nurturing poverty in Indonesia,” Hasbi said, adding that the FPI would focus on combating corruption from now on. A member of the House of Representatives’ special committee on the bill, Abdul Malik Haramain of the National Awakening Party (PKB), promised that the House would guide the deliberation of the bill to avoid lawmakers and government officials using it as a tool to repress mass organizations in the country. “We will ensure that the revision of the bill provides an opportunity for the public to report violent groups to the Home Ministry,” he said. He assured that the deliberation of the bill was not meant for anarchic groups such as the FPI, but for the managing of foreign-funded organizations operating in Indonesia. “There are more than 160 foreign-funded organizations in the country, of which less than 100 are registered. We must do something about them,” he said. Tri Pranadji, an expert from the Home Ministry, assured that the revision of the 1985 Law on Mass Organization was meant to re-organize foreign organizations operating in Indonesia, as well as foreign-funded ones, as the ministry had found that some of them were involved in money laundering. “We have found indications leading to involvement of foreign funded organizations in irregularities, such as money laundering. However, there has yet to be any proof of this, but we are nearly there,” he said, refusing to disclose any further details. “The revision of the bill must instead disband foreign-funded organizations because they are a threat to the unity and security of the country. Some of these foreign-funded organizations even have offices at several ministries. This is dangerous because they might see important data [about Indonesia] and transfer it to their respected countries,” Saleh said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/20/calls-govt-boost-policing-deter-groups-using-violence.html,,2012
"Mon, February 20 2012",Anti-FPI movement to take the fight online,"Civil rights activists grouped under the banner “Indonesia-without-the-FPI” said on Sunday that they would attempt to deter further acceleration of the FPI movement. The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) is widely known for its use of violence in pushing its ideas to the public. “As the [anti-FPI] movement was born on the Internet, we will continue our campaign online. It will be done through Twitter, through blogging and other social media tools,” movement volunteer Shinte Galeshka told The Jakarta Post. The group created their blog over the weekend and it can be accessed through indonesiatanpafpi.wordpress.com. The group posted its first writing on Sunday, detailing its history and its mission, among other things. The group has also created a Twitter account @indtanpafpi, which has been active since Feb. 19. In the first week since its inception, the account has found 700 followers. The movement first made national headlines last week after they staged a rally around the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle on Feb. 14, demanding the government disband the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI). The protest took a violent turn when one of its coordinators, identified as Bhagavad Sambada, was attacked by a man later identified as J. J then grabbed one of the protester’s banners and trampled on it, inciting anger among many protesters. Along with three other men, J was then arrested by the police and was charged under Criminal Code Article 170 on forceful attack with the intent to inflict harm. All four men were later identified as FPI sympathizers. Bhagavad said on Sunday that the movement had spread to other cities across Indonesia. He cited the anti-violence protest held in Surabaya on Friday, where dozens of local residents staged a demonstration in front of the Surabaya Zoo to reject acts of violence in the name of religion. “The snowball has rolled and it is getting bigger. The movement will be more widespread and will be unstoppable,” said Bhagavad. Women’s rights activist Mariana Amirudin, who also serves as the movement’s spokesperson, said that the campaign against violent groups must be conducted peacefully. “We want to raise everyone’s awareness that violence is unjustifiable under any circumstances. We don’t want to hurt anyone. All protests must not resort to violence,” Mariana said. In addition, Shinte said that all Jakartans must stand up and reject acts of vigilantism that have been shown by mass organizations. “End the silence. End the ignorance. Every time we do not say anything, it is the same as condoning what these vigilantes are doing. If the police are deemed ineffective in solving problems, the public must put them under pressure instead of taking justice into their own hands,” he added. The FPI is a notorious hard-line group known for its violent crackdowns on nightclubs and massage parlors, which it deems as “sinful places.” The Palangkaraya people in Central Kalimantan recently rejected the opening of FPI chapter in the city by staging a protest at Tjilik Riwut Airport. They rejected the scheduled-arrival of four FPI leaders who expected to inaugurate the branch’s executive board.

"Tue, February 21 2012",Issues of the day: ‘FPI acts beyond law enforcement’,"Feb. 18, Online Muhammadiyah Youth chairman Saleh Daulay said that in its actions the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) had acted beyond law enforcement, especially the police. “The FPI seems to have more power than law enforcers,” Saleh said as quoted by tribunnews.com on Saturday during a discussion about a proposed bill on mass organizations. Saleh was commenting on the statement made by the FPI’s legal and propagation division staff Hasbi Ibrahim, who said the FPI took action because of their perception of sluggishness on the behalf of the police in upholding law, particularly concerning night clubs and places of vice. Your comments: I believe this sense of being a vigilante is deeply rooted within all Indonesians as part of the pack mentality. In a way, it is not all negative. What I fear is that if the government doesn’t do something quickly, there will be another group of vigilantes resorting to violence to end violence. If this happens, the battle is won, but not the war. Anak Rantau Singapore The end is complete. There is no room for free-riders in this republic. Joshua Jakarta It is the right time to stop any organization acting in organized crime. Setio Samarinda The FPI is a reflection of poverty directly caused by the ingrained corruption that has stalked our country for so many years. Good examples should have been set by top leaders of political, religious and other civil organizations. There are no role models to follow. Discipline within law enforcement has been waning. The result is a morally corrupt society where the majority is poor, often goes hungry and has no voice in decision making. That is the environment where the likes of the FPI thrive. It requires a new set of leaders who do not depend on money politics, bribery and corruption. Perhaps we will see opportunity in the next general election. Henry Manoe Kupang Finally, both NU and Muhammadiyah’s youth organizations have expressed their opinions about the FPI. NU and Muhammadiyah shall be more active in educating Muslim brothers and sisters in order to keep distance from radical organizations. If possible, they have to teach the FPI to behave like Muslims.

"Wed, February 22 2012",View Point: Indonesia’s pie-in-the-sky religious harmony,"At the beginning of this month, I received a circular about the second World Interfaith Harmony Week (WIHW) announcing it had officially wrapped up, and had been a great success. The organizers reported over 260 events in over 40 countries but “it’s likely the total number of events will continue to go up … as we continue to find many events that were not posted to our site, indicating a large growth from last year”. The circular announced the highlights of the WIWH 2012. I read that it was celebrated for the first time at the UN. In the UK, the Interfaith Relations Committee (IFRC) held an event at the House of Lords that included many distinguished guests. In the Australian Parliament, over 100 religious, spiritual and community leaders were invited to a morning reception. In addition, they invited people to send in pictures from the events they attended to contribute to a photo gallery and to provide feedback. As a token of the WIHW’s appreciation for all this, a respondent will be selected to receive a set of handmade harmony beads. I’m not a cynical person (no, really), but my immediate reaction to the circular was, get real. How can events in the UK, the House of Lords or morning tea in the Australian Parliament seriously contribute to reducing religious conflict in Indonesia or the Middle East, pray (sic!) tell? What will they do next? Try to fix religious conflict by giving out 7 billion harmony beads to everyone on Earth? Isn’t it all just pie in the sky? I’m not saying there’s anything inherently wrong with interfaith events. It’s just that they are not a solution to interreligious conflict in themselves. In fact, many are just an exercise in preaching to the converted, gathering together people who already believe in religious harmony. Can you imagine al-Qaeda or the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) attending an interfaith dialogue? The level of interaction at these events is also often superficial anyway. It has to be, because if participants go deeper into religious doctrine they’ll start arguing. This means that some dialogue is little more than a feel-good exercise in mutual self-congratulation. Indonesia, for example, recently formalized an Inter-Religious Council (bringing together leaders from major faiths in the country to tackle interreligious conflicts in the country) but it hasn’t exactly stopped religious conflict, has it? I accept that not all inter-faith meetings are a waste of time, however. They can be useful when they take place at the grass-roots level – as opposed to the UN or the House of Lords! — and deal directly with real, local issues. I have often been critical of the late Abdurrahman Wahid (Gus Dur) but he did help build better relations between the Christians, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah (the two biggest Muslim organizations in Indonesia) a decade or more ago, bringing members together to do the hard work of talking through differences and finding commonalities. This was one reason why Pope Benedict XVI’s controversial Regensburg lecture in 2006 — which more than implied that Islam is a violent religion — did not lead to a crisis here in Indonesia. Franz Magnis Suseno, a leading Indonesian Catholic scholar and priest has also been at the forefront of inter-religious conflict resolution for decades — again at the grassroots. According to him, many Catholic parishes have established contacts with local Muslims and this has repeatedly eased resistance to plans to build churches. Unfortunately, the beleaguered Indonesian Christian Church (GKI) Taman Yasmin hasn’t benefited from this approach. Why? Because the state isn’t playing the role it should, as reflected in the typical it’s-not-my–problem stance adopted yet again by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY). According to him, the Taman Yasmin dispute should be handled by the local administration. OK, Mr. President, we know we have regional autonomy laws but that doesn’t mean you can just dismiss organized mob attacks by saying “such an incident has also happened in other places across the country. This issue has gone on for years.” (see The Jakarta Post, Feb. 15). As if that makes communal violence OK. What a statesman! What a leader! What an upholder of the law! What a bad example. And that is part of the reason why intolerance is increasing. Hard-line groups like the FPI can continue their belligerent ways with impunity because of state impotence. Din Syamsuddin, chairman of our Inter-Religious Council, for example, has said religious groups have the right to exist, so long as they don’t resort to violence. Has he been living under a rock all these years? The FPI and other hard-line groups make threats, intimidate, cause destruction and violence and even kill routinely but the state does next to nothing, while peaceful groups like Christians, Hindus, animists and Ahmadis, etc. are persecuted. And what about Alexander Aan, the Indonesian atheist who posted “God doesn’t exist” on his Facebook wall and found himself facing blasphemy charges? He’ll be locked up, while hard-line thugs continue to walk our streets, threatening anyone who dares disagree with them. It’s ironic that SBY — who has been so weak in dealing with hard-liners — now faces an FPI rally against him personally when he visits Surakarta. I’m sure it won’t be quite the sort of interfaith event WIHW had in mind, but maybe it will convince our President that we are well past the point when beads, morning tea and platitudes are enough to fix rising religious violence.

"Fri, February 24 2012",Issue of the day: FPI commits to leaving violence behind,"Feb. 17, Online The Islam Defenders Front (FPI), a hard-liner group that has been under the spotlight recently as its violent image has met resistance from other community groups, has committed to changing its ways. The group’s leader Rizieq Shihab said during his visit to the Religious Affairs Ministry on Friday that FPI would fight for justice and corruption eradication from now on. “The incident at the Home Ministry and various others incidents are no longer the group’s hallmark. FPI has left that paradigm,” he said as quoted by Antara news agency. FPI members were involved in vandalizing the Home Ministry office in Jakarta during its protest last month, prompting the ministry to issue its final warning before suspending the group. As its grasp on public sympathy has begun to slip, various community groups have begun standing up to the FPI, including most notably a protest initiated by the Dayak ethnic group at Tjilik Riwut Airport last week to block FPI leaders’ arrival.

"Mon, February 27 2012","Muslim ‘jago’ FPI will never die, but fade away","The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) has touched a public nerve yet again. Now, it is not because of attacks on food stalls, night clubs, pro-pluralist rallies or minority-rights events. No, this time it is about a peaceful event to celebrate the opening of the FPI’s new chapter in Central Kalimantan, a region where bloody conflict between migrants and indigenous people occurred a decade ago. Even the hosts resisted the arrival by ship of some FPI members who were en route to Sampit. Local authorities apparently assumed it could signal the beginning of a new conflict. Thus a well-prepared trip by FPI officials to the Central Kalimantan capital of Palangka Raya was met by a likewise carefully organized massive rejection by important elements in the province’s society; Dayak business networks and community groups. In the mid-2000s, the radicals were rejected even before departing for Jombang, East Java’s base of the Muslim moderate Nahdlatul Ulama’s fighting guard, the Banser. The humiliation the FPI suffered is unprecedented. Kalimantan and Sulawesi provinces followed suit in turning them away, middle class liberals rallied triumphantly in Jakarta and elsewhere to support the rejection and called for the disbandment of the organization in a movement called “Indonesia without FPI”. For the first time even the state is considering freezing, perhaps even banning, the FPI. The Home Affairs Ministry, a few legislators and prominent figures, including former vice president Jusuf Kalla and former president Megawati Soekarnoputri, support the idea. A statement by a distinguished foreign visitor, something commonly seen as foreign interference, was welcomed as he pointedly asked “Who authorized FPI to act on behalf of Islam?” So, is the state finally ready to confront organized thugs who act violently in the name of the nation’s majority religion? Perhaps surprisingly the FPI phenomenon, with its characteristic threats, intimidation and violent acts, is treated as mere religious hardline posturing. In fact, the phenomenon of politically connected thugs known as preman is not new: Indeed, it is historically rooted in different political cultures. Social historians have since Eric Hobsbawn ( 1970s ) dealt with the state and banditry. The brigands who operated in the countryside were defined in terms of their ideal of serving local communities, but the forms varied according to structural contexts. In 1860s Sicily, Italy, they grew into infamous warlords of a sort — mafiosi. In Java, we recognize Robin Hood-like figures in legends like Ken Arok. Such elusive figures, traditionally called jago (fighting cock, jawara and various other local terms) tended to be admired, worshiped and mythologized precisely because of their physical skills, supernatural strength and role as guardians, or so they aspired, of the community. Hence, they were often involved as agents of social change. Its modern varieties also emerged in time of trouble. Robert Cribb ( 2010 ) has described various brigands-turned-revolutionaries around Jakarta and Bekasi at the time of the Revolution. The emergence of the nation-state meant jago were subjected to the rule of law. To outlaw the FPI, or any legal organization for that matter, would mean to suppress human rights, stigmatize them and perhaps ignite violence only to end up with a tragedy like the 1965-66 massacres. A state would fail if unable to protect its citizens since it is precisely the raison d’etre of a state to protect its citizens. Which would in turn mean it was unable to advance civilization since to be civilized is to curb state and private violence. True, FPI members are not necessarily all criminals although some of its leaders have been tried for various crimes. Originating from and organized amid the urban dynamic, they’re distinct from the traditional jago of the hinterland. Militants like the FPI and the now defunct Laskar Jihad are particularly jingoistic while pretending to be heroic (note the use of terms “front” and “Laskar”, reminiscent of the nation’s independence struggle), they are typically urban jago. Yet they retain some traditional characteristics. Despite the use of religious mantras and symbols as their ideological prime mover, they have revived the importance of physical skills, perform symbolic rituals and, most significantly, send challenging messages to the establishment by pretending to protect society. In addition, they question the authority of the predominantly moderate religious elite. Here the expressive body language and message (“Let’s wage war against Ahmadiyah. Kill them! Kill them!”) of a man called Sobri Lubis in a widely shared YouTube video in February 2008, are instructive. Shortly after, on June 1 that year, the FPI, now marching with a different name and attributes, attacked groups defending pluralist values. “We’re ready to wage war, that’s our ijtihad (mission),” FPI commander Munarman told me the next day. Months later, a group of young men with a similar spirit committed killings in Cikeusik, Banten. Such jago-istic discourse may just be a sign of changing times. With globalizing capitalism speedily moving forward, changes since the late 1990s have undermined the old military elite of Soeharto’s New Order, though it is not completely defeated or replaced. Many have linked the emergence of the FPI to the predicament of some disgruntled military and police generals. “It was just part of their game,” the late former President Abdurrahman “Gus Dur” Wahid said after confirming their names to me. However, unlike their proteges, the former generals have now become regular politicians, completely preoccupied with business, politics and elections. The rise of a new consuming class — being part of the growing middle class that is the driving force for economic growth — combined with public anger at the FPI, suggests that these kinds of jago are no longer a secure and effective instrument. Indeed, unlike the now defunct Laskar Jihad, the FPI was reportedly too short of money to travel en mass to Kalimantan. In other words, Muslim jago like the FPI will decline, or have to find “projects” of their own such as defending the so-called holy sites of Priok (where they clashed with municipal public order officials in April 2010), helping to provide security during the Ramadhan fasting month or, perhaps, mobilizing and intimidating voters during elections. In all likelihood, like the generals who created them, they will never die, they will just — hopefully — fade away.

"Mon, February 27 2012",FPI and the pressing social need,"The rejection of Islam Defenders Front (FPI) members in Palangka Raya earlier this month has apparently incited tension, not only among Central Kalimantan residents but also the nation as a whole. Following the incident on Feb. 14, a group of anti-violence activists held a demonstration demanding the disbandment of the organization, citing its violent track records. Interestingly, the issue was also addressed during a meeting between the President and the media at the State Palace on Feb. 13. Public rejection or to some extent demand for the dissolution of an organization of course cannot escape human rights discourse. The discourse may extend to how actually freedom to assembly and association can be restricted by the state. At this point, as a matter of human rights law, there are three questions that we need to answer before rejecting or even disbanding the FPI. First, does it matter where/in what place an intended assembly/association takes place? From the Palangkaraya incident, we may assume that an intention to associate or form an assembly associate should comply with the people’s social and cultural condition. According to the deputy chairman of the Central Kalimantan Dayak Tribe Council, FPI activities are prone to violence and considered incompatible with the indigenous tribe culture, which highly promotes harmony and peace. Hence, we can simply say that the freedom to assembly/association should take into account the culture of the society where such a freedom is to be exercised. Second, as an issue of human rights law, does it matter who/which (group of) persons want(s) to assemble/associate? This question is rather tricky to answer. Nonetheless, I would argue that it is not the FPI as a mass organization that should be banished, but the violent demeanor of its members instead. Additionally, legally speaking, the law also preserves everyone’s right to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests (Article 22 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or ICCPR). Further, the third question would be, as a matter of human rights in practice, does it matter what is the envisioned purpose/aim of the association/ assembly? To get an answer, I would base the argument on Article 20 of the ICCPR, which states that any propaganda for war, advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law. The article thus should be considered as a limitation for the purpose/aims of one right to form an assembly or association, and certainly it should apply to the FPI. Having those contemplative questions in mind, we may now move on to the possible state’s interference with the FPI’s freedom to assemble and associate and also try to find the legitimate justification of it. From a human rights standpoint, Article 22 (2) of the ICCPR enshrines that “No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right [to freedom of association] other than those which are prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others”. Hence, to restrict or dissolve the FPI, it ought to fulfill two main requirements, namely prescribed by law and necessity in a democratic society. However, the latter would be more problematic than the former, as the 1985 Law on Mass Organizations prescribes clearly the state’s authority upon mass organizations, such as the FPI. Thus, how can we determine a circumstance as “necessity in a democratic society”? In particular, related to the recent compelling voices over rejection and dissolution of the FPI, could we deem such a current pressing social need as a necessity in a democratic society? Let us look at an example at the European Court of Human Rights practice, which according to many experts is the most proficient regional human rights judicial body, as explained in the case of Handyside vs the United Kingdom. The Court argued that necessity “is not synonymous with “indispensable”… neither has it the flexibility of such expressions as “admissible”, “ordinary”, “useful”, “reasonable” or “desirable”. To be more specific, in Olsson vs Sweden the court delineated that “the notion of necessity implies that interference corresponds to a pressing social need and, in particular, that it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued”. From the court’s interpretation, we can conclude that the term necessity is rather a broad terminology. It is worth noting that necessity has a close nexus, or to a certain extent a causal relation, with the pressing social need and it should also be based on a legitimate aim. Thus, the character of state’s interference, in this case upon the FPI, should be able to strike a fair balance between the protection of individual rights to assemble/associate and the national interests as a whole. Based on those notions above, we may arrive at several conclusions regarding the public’s voices vis-à-vis the presence of the FPI. First, the right to assemble and associate should be in line with the characteristics of the society where such rights are being exercised and should not be aimed to harm the freedom itself. Second, the state has the authority to restrict or dissolve the FPI as long as such interference prescribed by law and considered as necessity in a democratic society. Lastly, in determining a policy upon the FPI, the state could actually consider the current pressing social need as a necessity in a democratic society.

"Thu, March 1 2012",Yogyakarta journalists speak out against violence,"A number of local journalists from different media outlets staged a rally in front of the Gedung Agung state palace in Yogyakarta on Wednesday, calling for a stop of various forms of violence committed by particular groups in society. The protest was held after a television reporter was injured following an exchange of stones and insults between supporters of the Islamic Jihad Front (FJI) and the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) on Tuesday after a trial session of FPI Yogyakarta chairman Bambang Tedy, who is standing trial on charges of alleged assault and defamation at the Yogyakarta District Court. A TV One reporter, Nuryanto, 33, who was covering the story, was injured during the incident. “Don’t make Indonesia an unsafe place for journalists,” the head of the TV One station’s Yogyakarta bureau, Hendrawan Setiawan, said in his speech at the protest. He said it was embarrassing that the violence happened right in front of security personnel. He also urged the police to thoroughly investigate the incident that had injured his reporter. The incident occurred when FJI members who had attended the trial mocked FPI members who were outside the court building. The situation rapidly degenerated into stone-throwing between the two sides, and Nuryanto, who was taking pictures of the incident, was caught in the crossfire. Nuryanto was taken to Yogyakarta Bethesda Hospital after the scuffle and received two stitches for the injury on his left temple. He also reported the case to the Yogyakarta City Police. The chairwoman of the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) Yogyakarta branch, Pito Agustine Rudiana, called on journalists to take measures to ensure their safety while covering conflicts. She said journalists had to follow certain standard operational procedures and the journalistic code of conduct as well as maintain independence when reporting conflicts. “No news is worth a life,” she said. Separately, FPI Yogyakarta chairman Bambang Tedi and his wife Sebrat Haryanti paid a visit on Wednesday afternoon to the TV One Yogyakarta bureau office and were received by Hendrawan Setiawan and Nuryanto. “We are concerned with what happened to Nuryanto,” Bambang said. He said he had no idea who had thrown the stone that hit Nuryanto and apologized if it was thrown by a member of the FPI. He also offered to hand over Rp 2 million (US$222) in cash as an expression of empathy, but Nuryanto turned it down. Nuryanto said what he experienced was part of the risks he had to face as a journalist. Bambang Teddy was tried for allegedly assaulting Erna Efriyanti, who reported him to the police for allegedly verbally abusing her, punching and spitting on her as she attempted to collect a debt from his wife.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/03/01/yogyakarta-journalists-speak-out-against-violence.html,,2012

"Thu, March 8 2012",Habib Hasan to face police questioning,"The Jakarta Police announced on Wednesday that they planned to question cleric Habib Hasan Assegaf on Thursday morning regarding sexual abuse allegations made against him. “We sent the first summons to him on Monday and expect him to come to our headquarters by Thursday at the latest,” police spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto told reporters. Police investigators were scheduled to question Hasan at 10 a.m. “He is still a witness in the case up to this point. We are yet to name him as suspect,” Rikwanto said. Habib Hasan’s name was thrust into the national limelight earlier this year after reports sprang up on online forums and social media websites alleging that he had sexually abused underage boys. He has allegedly been committing such indecent acts for six years. The case sparked a nationwide media furor, with many local media outlets dubbing Hasan “the lecherous cleric”. The online reports stated that the alleged abuse took place in Kampung Kandang in Jagakarsa, South Jakarta, where Hasan had set up his own Islamic congregation, named Nurul Musthofa. The study group is among the largest in the capital and often blocks stretches of roads to hold sermons in public places, which causes severe traffic congestion. According to the reports, the families of the alleged victims — aged between 14 and 19 when the abuse took place — had reported the case to the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) and the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Hasan allegedly confessed to the abuse in front of the victims’ parents in mid-November last year, reportedly saying that his actions were in the name of his “holy guardianship”. So far, 13 victims have reported Hasan for sexual abuse to the police. The last two victims came to the police headquarters on Tuesday, reporting that they were sexually abused by Hasan sometime in 2010. Rikwanto said that if Hasan chose not to come to the police’s headquarters for questioning on Thursday, the police would send him a second summons. “If he doesn’t show up after two summons, then we will take him by force in line with the procedures,” he said. The victims filed reports with the Jakarta Police last December. Besides filing a report with the police, the victims also filed reports with the Indonesian Child Protection Commission (KPAI). Following the report, the KPAI summoned the cleric on Feb. 13 but he failed to appear. Hasan is known to have close ties to Islam Defenders Front (FPI) chief patron Habib Rizieq Shihab. The FPI is a hard-line group notorious for its violent crackdowns on nightclubs and massage parlors that it deems sinful places. Habib is an honorific title for the descendants of Prophet Muhammad. In Indonesia, the title is commonly used by clerics of Yemeni descent. — JP/Iman Mahditama",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/03/08/habib-hasan-face-police-questioning.html,,2012
"Wed, March 14 2012",Letter: Why should the FPI be banned?,"I refer to an article on “Stop calling for FPI disbandment,” (The Jakarta Post, March 6) and comments on the Readers’ Forum page on March 8. Banning certain groups or organizations is against our constitutional law and limits liberty and the human rights of free association. There are a lot of far more dangerous groups, racist groups like neo-Nazis or white supremacists, underground groups like the new world order, skull and bones, the Zionist movement, etc. These groups should be banned in terms of their crimes, terror and hate-spreading acts which cause public disintegration and social conflicts. The FPI isn’t such a group, even though some of their raids involved violence, but that could be avoided if there was equality before the law and consistency in enforcing the law. How come liquor stores and night clubs or prostitution businesses can operate within areas where they shouldn’t be allowed? They run illegally, by bribery, freely taking their dirty profits by dishonoring the community, intoxicating the children and youth, bringing social unrest. The FPI nowadays collaborates with the police to enact the law. The FPI also renders its services to protect the people from companies who bribe the authorities and then “legally” take over people’s land and houses by illegal means. The FPI with its vigilance and monitoring has been a constant guardian of the community especially with regard to prostitution and trafficking, liquor distribution and moral reforms. Without the FPI, the law enforcement knife would cut the poor sharply but be blunt on the rich.

"Fri, March 16 2012",Pontianak gripped by brief but high tension,"The West Kalimantan provincial capital of Pontianak was briefly gripped by tension on Thursday following a report that a major rally was going to be held by the Dayak people against the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). The West Kalimantan Police were forced to deploy 100 Mobile Brigade (Brimob) personnel and 100 other Sabhara officers to help maintain security in the city. They were stationed in a number of vital areas. The police later blockaded the Kapuas I Bridge, one of two major bridges linking several main roads in Pontianak, to prevent any movement by mass protesters. Thursday’s rally was sparked by the lowering of a banner signaling the rejection of the FPI at the Dayak Pangsuma boarding house on Jl. Wahid Hasyim in Pontianak a day earlier. The incident on Wednesday had actually been settled through a dialogue involving community figures, representatives from Dayak youth and FPI officers at the Pontianak Police headquarters in the evening. Hundreds of Dayak people gathered at the Rumah Betang traditional house on Jl. Sutoyo, South Pontianak, not far from the governor’s hall. They planned to hold a peaceful rally to the West Kalimantan Police headquarters on Jl. A. Yani. As the number of protesters grew, West Kalimantan Police chief Brig. Gen. Unggung Cahyono decided to go to Rumah Betang to talk with them and defuse the increasing tension. Later, Unggung urged the public not to be easily provoked into taking any action that could affect local harmony. “Please remember: don’t allow yourselves to be provoked. That’s our request,” Unggung said as quoted by the Antara news agency. He said the public had to control their reactions and also not to provoke others, so as to keep the peace in West Kalimantan. “With regard to the Dayak youths’ request for the disbandment of the FPI, the police will convey their request to the central government, which has the authority to do that,” West Kalimantan Police spokesman Adj. Sr. Comr. Mukson Munandar said. Amid the tense situation, a number of Pontianak residents responded positively to the police chief’s request for peace. Their hopes for peace were conveyed on social-networking sites, where they reminded one another not to be provoked by issues relating to ethnicity and religion. A resident named Rendra Oktora wrote a message: “Let’s make Pontianak peaceful and stop making a mess over things that are unclear. Let’s make West Kalimantan peaceful.” The message was hailed by many of his friends. Another resident, Eka, hoped that nothing would happen in the city that could hurt anyone. “There must not be any clashes. Pontianak must remain secure and peaceful,” Eka wrote. Last month, the Central Kalimantan administration issued a letter formally rejecting the presence of the FPI in the province. The administration sent the letter to high-ranking officials in the central government, including President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, according to Central Kalimantan Deputy Governor Achmad Diran. “The letter says that we firmly reject the FPI and won’t let the FPI establish a chapter in the province, as it contradicts the local wisdom of the Dayak people, who uphold peace,” Achmad said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/03/16/pontianak-gripped-brief-high-tension.html,,2012

There are laws already that tell me that hitting people is bad. The groups mentioned here sort of showed the ideology of the writer. You mention Zionist movement. I have gone to many places in Indonesia and I have not come across white supremacy groups or even Neo Nazi groups. I have come across many radical groups using Islam to justify their violence and intolerance: Spreading their seditious propaganda of destroying Pancasila and raising an Islamic sharia nation on its rubble. Concerning helping the “little man” against the rich isn’t done from altruism. They receive fees from the poor to do this. Then turn around and blackmail the rich for more money. In addition, those clubs/nightclubs and liquor stores you so generously clump with prostitution establishments, last time I checked, the Indonesian law does not prohibit the operation of such establishments as long as they adhere to operational laws. I like how the writer also turns around to blame the police, and the rich, yet conveniently forgets the many acts of violence (leading to death in some situations) perpetrated continually by the group.

Scores of security officers were stationed in a number of the city’s vital areas. The police later blockaded the Kapuas I Bridge, one of two major bridges linking several main roads in Pontianak, to prevent the movement of masses of protesters. Thursday’s uncertain situation was sparked by the unfurling of a banner that signaled the rejection of the FPI at the Dayak Pangsuma boarding house on Jl. Wahid Hasyim in Pontianak on Wednesday. The incident on Wednesday had actually been settled through a dialogue involving community figures, representatives from Dayak youth and FPI officers at the Pontianak Police headquarters in the evening. On Thursday, various baseless rumors were spread, saying there had been an ethnic war. There were others that said there were many victims.

"Wed, March 21 2012",FPI Yogya chief could face 4 months in jail,"The chairman of the Islam Defenders’ Front (FPI) Yogyakarta branch, Bambang Teddy, was charged with assault during a trial at the Yogyakarta District Court on Tuesday, which could lead to four months’ imprisonment and eight months’ probation. The prosecutor charged Bambang Teddy with Article 351 of the Criminal Code on assault. “The article actually carries a penalty of two years and eight months. However, as the defendant has been well behaved during the trial and has also apologized to the victim, the charge has been reduced to four months,” prosecutor Aliansyah told the court on Tuesday. The alleged assault started when Bambang’s wife, Sebrat Haryanti, was in debt to Erna Efriyanti, who reported the case to the FPI’s central office in Jakarta after Sebrat failed to pay the debt, which was reportedly worth some Rp 50 million (US$5,450). Not long after the report was filed, Bambang met Erna at a shopping center in the city in November 2011, where the former reportedly verbally abused Erna, spat on her and assaulted her, causing her to require a day of care at a hospital because of the assault. Responding to the charge, Bambang objected, saying that he was being treated unfairly. He said the prosecutor’s office had asked him to pay Rp 50 million to Erna to have his charge reduced. He said he had nothing to do with the debt, but was involved in the assault. “This is not fair. I completely surrender the case to the judge to decide on the sentence,” Bambang said. Separately, Aliansyah said that his side had never asked the defendant for money. “The charge is classified and was only revealed at the trial,” he said. He added that his side did not have the authority to deal with the debt case, but if asked, could facilitate for a solution. The trial on Tuesday was tightly guarded by the local police as both the supporters of the FPI and supporters of Erna, which were grouped under the Yogyakarta Muslim organization forum, were at the court for the trial.

"Thu, April 5 2012",The FPI and the effectiveness of social sanctions,"Despite facing protests and rejection, the FPI (Islam Defenders Front) seems to continue its violent actions. However, Aboeprijadi Santoso’s article titled “Muslim ‘jago’ FPI will never die, but fade away” (The Jakarta Post, Feb. 27) is not only interesting, but also challenging. In his profound analysis, Santoso suggests that the FPI is a typically urban jago that uses religious mantras, physical skills to send tough messages by pretending to protect society. Surprisingly, he also has an optimistic prediction: This group will decline and finally fade away or, alternatively, find another “projects” to survive. I share his analysis, particularly for its relation to current religious and political developments. Yet, there is an effort that could be taken into consideration: mobilized social sanction. Let’s begin with a simple question: is it possible to see “Indonesia without FPI” as proposed by pro-pluralism activists in Jakarta? The answer is doubtful. So far, there has been no substantial effort from the government to disband the FPI. Meanwhile, most ordinary people do not want to take the risk if they get involved in fighting against the FPI — let alone ordinary people. Even the police seem to be unable to control this group. Consequently, it has been growing significantly across the country over the last several years. Last year, the FPI threatened the government, declaring that it would conduct a jihad (holy war) to topple the Yudhoyono administration if he did not disband Ahmadiyah. Nonetheless, the government did not give any response to this threat. In fact, the pro-pluralism demonstrations against the FPI have been more spontaneous instead of well-organized and mobilized action. It was simply a follow-up on messages that were disseminated through social media such as SMS, Facebook and Twitter, and inspired by the news about the rejection of the Dayak community in Central Kalimantan of the establishment of an FPI local branch. Although their initiative is appreciated, it was unfortunate that the number of participants was quite limited to only around 50 people. Fortunately, their action was covered by both print and electronic media, so their mission has been widely spread to the public. It basically reminded the government and the Indonesian people to take action against any organization comittted to violent and antipluralism. However, even such a small demonstration was not free from violence. There were two “mysterious” people who attacked them although they were surrounded by hundreds of police. Why were the police unable to protect the demonstration? It is hard to know. Yet, the so-called “National Monument Tragedy” on June 1, 2008, was such a lesson learned. At that time, the FPI attacked rally participants of the National Alliance for Religious Freedom and Belief (AKKBP). It was merely a peaceful rally to commemorate the birth of our state ideology, Pancasila. Around 3,000 members of interfaith communities participated in the rally. It was shocking that a well-organized and mobilized FPI paramilitary group brutally attacked them. More than 70 people were wounded and some were hospitalized due to serious injuries, including myself. Yet, the police only came after the FPI struck. Based on the evidence, it seems that there is something wrong with government’s policies in controlling religious-based organizations committed to acts of violence. Pro-pluralism activists have argued that the government maintains such laissez-faire politics, which fosters indecisiveness and uncertainty in response to growing religious radicalism. Still, there has been no significant action until now. In response to this phenomenon, the Nahdlatul Ulama-affiliated Anshor Youth Movement in East Java strongly urged the government to dissolve the FPI. Yet, the idea of disbanding the FPI is not a guarantee that religious violence will cease to exist. Meanwhile, the government is planning to implement the Law on Social Organizations to control any groups committed to acts of violence. Indeed, the disbandment of FPI may seem to be the best solution to resolve the problem. However, if the government tries to dissolve the FPI, their leaders would quickly reestablish the group under a new name, but with the same mission and activities. Moreover, the law was issued by the New Order to ensure its political hegemony and surpress civil society movements. There would be strong opposition from pro-democracy and human rights activists if the government wanted to implement it. Frankly, although I was one of FPI’s victims in 2008, I disagree with the dissolution of the FPI. From the perspective of democracy and human rights, the FPI has the right to exist. Nonetheless, it has to follow the rule of law and avoid violent and uncivilized acts. Furthermore, it is crucial to improve people’s awareness and massive public campaigns against any acts of violence. People must be united within the spirit of “zero tolerance” of religious-based violence perpetrated by all groups, not just the FPI. Such a movement should be based on a peace-loving mission and take action to isolate groups committed to acts of violence. The role of both the print and electronic media is quite significant, particularly in promoting this movement publicly. Learning from the June 1, 2008 tragedy, the media effectively spread news about the brutal attack of FPI. At that time, many people condemned the FPI and strongly urged the government to act against the group. Hundreds of police finally raided FPI’s headquarters and sent its leaders to jail. For a certain period, the FPI underwent great social sanction and was alienated from the public. It is clear that social sanction is sometimes much more effective to counter organizations that easily resort to violence, particularly if the government is reluctant to control them. However, it will need spirit, solidarity, and sustainable public campaign of “zero tolerance” against the culture of violence in the society, not just a temporary and sporadic action. Pro-pluralism proponents, human rights activists, interfaith leaders, moderate Muslim organizations and the media, should be able to raise people’s awaraness and public support in countering religious radicalism. Finally, Indonesia needs “friendly Islam”, not “angry Islam”, as Islam is a religion of peace, not violence. The FPI needs to change its dakwah (proselytization) in the future; or else it will be alienated by society forever.

"Wed, April 18 2012",Children’s life: Between gangsters and hard-liners,"Hard-liners: Islam Defenders Front (FPI) members mobilize in defense of their leader Habib Rizieq (not pictured) in 2008. Rizieq will be questioned by police over the group’s involvement in a brawl with another organization. JP/R. Berto Wedhatama The sky was bright that afternoon when tens of kids were reciting verses from the Koran. Sitting on the floor in a cramped room, they had to share the holy book with others. It, however, didn’t weaken their enthusiasm to learn. These children live with their families in a red-light area of Kebon Kacang in Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta. Aini Kanita Sari, 10, was one of them. “I love learning here [in the center]. It helps me learn Koran recital faster. Now, I can recite the Koran,” she told The Jakarta Post during a recent joint visit to the area by a team from the European Union (EU) and the Community Empowerment National Program (PNPM) Peduli. Students in the neighborhood spend their afternoons at the Hurin ‘In Study Center after school. They learn how to recite the Koran and develop their potential in music, drawing and performing arts. The center serves a second home for marginalized young people, including the children of sex workers. Ramli Izhaque, 49, an ustaz (Islamic teacher) and coordinator at the center, said Hurin ‘In used to be a traditional Koran recitation community initiated by his grandfather. After taking over the center, he included social training activities to develop the children’s skills. Ramli said the neighborhood and Tanah Abang in general, had developed a notorious reputation as a place of street thugs. Combined with cheap prostitution, the notoriety of that area was even broader. Not too far from Kebon Kacang is the headquarters of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), which is famous for its use of violence. “It seems children in this area have only two possibilities when they grow up — to either become a thug or join the FPI as a hard-liner,” said Ramli. To provide the children with more possibilities, the center was now ingraining the children with a more humanist Islamic teaching, he said. Three main subjects called “3S” — salat (praying), surah (Koran recitation) and silat (traditional martial arts) — still form the core of Hurin In teachings. “Unlike previous teachings, we now give them humanity messages. Praying and Koran recitation are God’s orders, but the children must also respect all humans regardless of their religions,” Ramli said. Today, 60–70 children ranging from pre-school age to senior high school are now active in the Hurin ‘In Study Center, funded by PNPM Peduli through its partner Indonesia for Humanity (IKA). “Most of them are children from marginalized groups, such as sex workers and garbage collectors, who are often not covered by existing poverty reduction programs,” said IKA executive director Anik Wusari. In the program, she said, children also learned various creative skills, such as making chocolate candies and dish-washing soap, partly to help economically empower their families. PNPM Peduli is a program funded by a number of different donors, including the European Union (EU), and is managed by the PNPM Support Facility (PSF), which is under the World Bank. Project funds are granted to three civil society organizations (CSOs), namely Kemitraan (Partnership), Lakpesdam NU, and the Association for Community Empowerment (ACE), who then disburse funds to local CSOs who actually implement the on-the-ground activities. In the pilot phase, a total US$4.21 million was allocated to the three large national CSOs, who granted it to 69 local CSOs. Started in October 2011, the pilot program was conducted in nearly 100 regencies in 27 provinces, and is slated to be completed by December this year before moving into the next phase in 2013. The World Bank’s PNPM Peduli coordinator, Felicity Pascoe, said one of the roles of PNPM Peduli was to support activities of marginalized people, as well as strengthening the management capacity of Indonesian CSOs. “The important thing is that marginalized people have skills, knowledge and other potential. PNPM Peduli is helping these people to reach their potential,” she said, adding that an additional $5.5 million had just been secured for continuing the program. Guy Platton, with the EU delegation to Indonesia, Brunei Darussalam and ASEAN, said keeping children off the streets filled with gangs and extreme Muslim groups was important to give them a chance of a better life. “What we want to see is that through these learning activities and income generating programs, marginalized youth will have greater chances of a better future,” he said, adding the EU contributed _4.9 million to the PSF through 2014.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/18/children-s-life-between-gangsters-and-hard-liners.html,,2012
"Wed, April 18 2012","‘Possible bombing’, brawl after sentencing of FPI branch leader","A blast from a possible bomb and a clash between rival Muslim groups marked the sentencing of the Islamic Defender Front’s (FPI) Yogyakarta branch chairman, Bambang Teddy, on Tuesday. In the Yogyakarta District Court, Bambang Teddy was sentenced to three months imprisonment, suspended with a six-month probation, for assaulting and defaming a woman inside a supermarket. The loud blast from the neighboring Mandala Krida Stadium was heard at about noon, not long after Bambang left the court. “It was very loud and thick smoke came out of it,” said Jiwo, a street vendor 50 meters from the blast site. No fatalities were reported, but the explosion damaged a tree and left street vendors operating in the neighborhood panicking. Yogyakarta Police’s bomb squad were promptly deployed to sweep the area with metal detectors. Yogyakarta City Police chief Sr. Comr. Mustakim said officers found a small motorcycle battery and a piece of cable, measuring between six and seven meters, at the site. This has raised suspicion that the blast could have come from a homemade bomb. “There is a possibility that it was detonated from a distance of seven meters, but let’s let the experts from the bomb squad decide,” Mustakim said at the blast site. Police did not identify the person behind the explosion. Bambang Subiyanto, a noodle vendor operating close to the explosion, said he did not recognize anything suspicious being placed in the area. But he expressed suspicion about a man who sat near his stall and another man who stood under a tree. Both were wearing helmets. At around the same time, supporters in the FPI leader’s entourage were involved in a clash with supporters of the Islamic Jihad Front (FJI) in Demakijo, Sleman, as they both made their way home from the same court. The FJI comprises supporters of Erna F Riyanti, who reported Bambang for assault and defamation. “We were blocked. We had to take one of our members to hospital because he broke his arm when he was hit with a stick,” Bambang said after the clash. FJI coordinator Abdulrochman denied the accusation. He said that when his group crossed paths with the FPI supporters, one of them fired an airsoft gun at his group and hit an FJI member, which resulted in the clash. They finally dispersed after dozens of soldiers from a nearby military battalion broke up the fighting. Separately, Sleman Police deputy chief Comr. Wahyu Agung Jatmiko said that he would facilitate a meeting between both parties in a bid to prevent bigger conflicts. Bambang was convicted over last November’s assault and defamation of Erna. The incident occurred after Bambang heard that Erna had asked his wife Sebrat Haryanti to pay off a debt to her. Bambang met Erna in a supermarket, where he punched and spat on her. He also threatened and verbally abused her. “You are proven to be guilty as charged, but you don’t have to serve the jail term,” presiding judge M Nurzaman said during sentencing. Bambang and the prosecutor said they were still thinking about whether to appeal. The session, as with previous hearings, was tightly guarded by police.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/18/possible-bombing-brawl-after-sentencing-fpi-branch-leader.html,,2012

"Sat, April 21 2012",Latest attack damages mosque in W. Java,"A crowd of around 150 people from various Islamic organizations, including local residents, reportedly vandalized on Friday the only mosque left for Ahmadiyah followers in Singaparna, Tasikmalaya, still used to hold their prayers. The attack was reported to have taken place around 10 a.m. Ahmadis Enda Juanda said the situation was tense from around 9 a.m. as the crowd began to assemble and some began wearing white and green robes. “They shouted and yelled, but only at the start, before they eventually started throwing rocks, shattering glass windows, and breaking into the mosque,” Enda told The Jakarta Post by phone. Enda was inside the mosque with fellow Ahmadis Didi, while around 25 others were watching the attack from outside the mosque. He said the crowd burned carpets and praying mats. He fled with Didi when the attackers tried to chase them. “I knew I had to save my life. I’m sure there is nothing wrong with my faith,” said Enda. Tasikmalaya chapter Indonesian Ahmadiyah Congregation (JAI) spokesman Budi Badrussalam claimed the attackers had tossed three Molotov cocktails at the mosque, which burned the carpets and mats. However, the fire did not flare up because it was immediately doused by officers from the village and district administrative offices. He regretted that police and many local village and district officers only stood still as they watched the anarchic acts. “The mosque is considered a historical building, as it was built in 1920 and is listed in the archives of historical buildings by the Historical Heritage and Preservation Center,” said Budi. Despite the damage, around 80 male and female Ahmadis performed Friday prayers at the mosque, as a symbol of their resistance, because the other Mahmud Mosque can no longer be used after being vandalized by another mob riot a few years ago. Budi said the crowd had erroneously interpreted the joint decree on Ahmadiyah. They perceived that Ahmadis are not allowed to worship, but they are also not allowed to spread their teachings to others. In response to the anarchy, Tasikmalaya chapter FPI spokeman Acep Sofyan denied that the FPI was involved in the incident as an organization. He said it was carried out by joint groupings of Islamic organizations, local residents and Islamic boarding schools, in the area where people were still angry because the mosque was being used by Ahmadis to perform prayers. The mosque was sealed twice by district officers, but the Ahmadis broke the seal and carried out their activities, he said. “The closure was not by the FPI, but Singaparna district officers, the local village chief and religious office based on the aspirations of the community. They are stubborn and don’t want to mix with other Muslims in other mosques, so residents took action on their own will,” said Acep. The incident was the second attack on an Ahmadiyah mosque, with the first taking place in January and leaving a mosque seriously damaged. Tasikmalaya Police chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Gupuh Setiyono denied police had ignored acts of vandalism. He said that the previous day the police had instead attempted a mediation approach between local residents and Ahmadiyah leaders.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/21/latest-attack-damages-mosque-w-java.html,,2012

Martinus Sitompul said on Saturday. He added that the police had received reports from the Ahmadiyah community and were still investigating the incident. The Ahmadiyah community’s Tasikmalaya branch spokesman, Budi Badrussalam, told The Jakarta Post that most of the 500 community members were safe and were currently staying in their own homes. “About nine of us, including witnesses and those who were injured during the attack, are at the Tasikmalaya Police station for a second round of questioning,” Budi said. Hundreds of people, with some wearing white and green garments and others carrying Islam Defenders Front (FPI) signs, attacked the mosque prior to Friday’s prayer.

"Tue, April 24 2012",Letter : Aburizal for President?,"Even the majority of Golkar seems to be against Aburizal for the Presidential chair. His attempt as a minister in SBY’s first Cabinet was not a big success — he was removed from his seat and was given another insignificant ministerial post. His reputation is already marred with the Lapindo Brantas scandal, which until now has not been resolved, yet his popularity in East and Central Java, where the majority of Indonesian people reside, is practically zero. Judging from the current political atmosphere, the election to the presidential seat in this country is not based on empty political promises but on popularity. Prabowo seems to be popular because the population is sick of religious skirmishes in this country, and they hope that he will be able to end it since the Ahmadiyah followers are still being harassed and Christian churches are continuously being attacked. SBY is too weak and is reluctant to deal with religious problems, he is violating the Pancasila by allowing fanatics to burn places of worship and killing its followers.

"Mon, May 7 2012",Freedom at risk from intolerance,"Activists have once again blamed the government of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono for not doing enough to rein in radical groups in the country that have graduated from harassing minority groups with impunity to becoming a scourge of free speech. Pluralism activist Ahmad Suaedy of the Wahid Institute said that the lack of conviction from the President in dealing with radical elements in the country had allowed groups like the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) to harass minority groups and silence activists who defend minority rights. “I think the government has leadership problems. [These] people know that the President always has doubts and has little courage to take action. This rubs off on officers in the field, who in turn take a hands-off approach. If he sticks with this type of leadership, things will only take a turn for the worse,” he told The Jakarta Post on Sunday. On Friday night, police in South Jakarta broke up a discussion in Salihara that featured Canadian writer Irshad Manji. The Pasar Minggu police precinct chief announced that Manji’s book launch had to be halted because it lacked a permit to hold an event involving a foreign national. The chief also cited residents’ opposition to the author and her background as a lesbian activist among the reasons behind the event’s termination. By halting the discussion, the police had apparently bowed to pressure from members of FPI, who picketed the Salihara Cultural Center hours before the discussion took place. FPI spokesman Munarman said that his group called for the halting of the discussion because of Manji’s promotion of lesbianism. “We don’t mind her sexuality as long as she keeps it to herself. However, as she decides to spread her views [that Islam should accept homosexuality], it is a different story,” Munarman told the Post on Saturday. Munarman, a former activist at the Legal Aid Institute (LBH), said that local residents, who happened to be FPI members, rejected Manji because of her views on the compatibility between Islam and homosexuality. He insisted that the Muslim community was not the only group who rejected Manji’s viewpoint, saying that “not a single religion in the world endorses lesbianism or homosexuality.” “If there are people who support lesbianism and homosexuality, they are sick people,” he said. The Jakarta Police denied that they acted on behalf of the FPI. Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto said that the police decided to stop the event because its organizers lacked the permit to hold the discussion, which was necessary as the event was a public event and involved a foreign national. Rikwanto said the Jakarta Police took full responsibility for its action. “The reports [that the FPI conducted a crackdown on the event] were concocted by the media. In fact, only around 20 [FPI] members were present,” he added. Manji held another session on Sunday at the office of the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) Jakarta branch in Kalibata, with the protection of members of Banser NU, the youth wing of Indonesia’s largest Muslim organization, Nahdlatul Ulama. Manji, who praised the organizers’ courage and what she called “progressive Indonesians”, said that she considered writing a book discussing the situation in the country. “I have one experience [or] two experiences … but I decided to not write it immediately after the tour. I will have to talk to more people. Give me one year,” she said, adding that Indonesia is a perfect model of pluralistic Islam in the real world. Contacted separately, Muslim scholar Komaruddin Hidayat, rector of the Syarif Hidayatullah Islamic State University said that the government should do more to rein in firebrand groups in society. “This is very dangerous. We’re like living in the jungle without law. The government is afraid of groups, especially those with religious symbols,” he said.

"Mon, May 7 2012",FPI gets tough on all foreign performers,"JAKARTA: The Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) insists that the group has been protesting the presence of all foreign artists who wear “revealing clothes” in Jakarta, not just American singer Lady Gaga. FPI spokesman Munarman said on Saturday that his organization demanded that the promoter cancel the controversial singers’ upcoming concert in June. “Who said that we were just protesting her concert? That was the journalists’ fault for not asking us about the matter in the first place,” he said. Munarman was responding to a question on why did not his group reject other performers such as Japanese band L’Arc en Ciel and South Korean group Super Junior, who recently held a concert in Jakarta. One of the members of the all-male group Super Junior reportedly took off his shirt for the audience in the group’s concert on April 27, while L’Arc en Ciel’s vocalist, Hyde, is famous for his seductive attitude while performing. Commenting on this, Munarman said that the FPI would raise its voice to reject all artists they deemed as “indulging in porn”. “People already have this so-called negative sentiment against the Muslim community. I believe that other religions will reject them as well. The rejection is not about Islam, but for the good of the society,” he said. Lady Gaga, who will perform in the capital on June 3, is well-known for her unconventional style of clothing. The singer is also famous for her advocacy toward homosexuality in her music. Conservative Christian groups in South Korea, for example, staged a series of protests against Lady Gaga during her recent concert in Seoul, accusing her of advocating homosexuality and pornography, The Korea Herald has reported.

"Tue, May 8 2012","Inaction against vigilantes, Indonesia in auto-pilot mode","Almost 14 years ago, authoritarian ruler Soeharto was dethroned in a wave of reform that swept over the country. Indonesians then eagerly welcomed the process of democratization, through which hopes of justice and freedom in the country have been nurtured. However, the well-known Indonesian proverb seems to ring true: Being releasing from tiger’s mouth, we are now caught by crocodile’s. Although the military regime built by Soeharto was gone, a different kind of tyranny has come to be. Vigilantes and thugs in the garb of Islamic conservatism and radicalism have intimidated the public, whereas the government, including the police, did almost nothing to stop them. New groups of Islamic vigilantes or thugs led by habibs (originally referring to the beloved people believed to be descendants of the Prophet Muhammad) with white robes, long beards and hoarse voices are mushrooming in Jakarta. What they want to show us through their street activities is that Islam is identical with fear and threats. In their protests, they yell, “God is great” to scare people. They sometimes wear white Muslim hats to convince their followers of their fake piety. But some also wear motorcycle helmets to protect their heads in case of fierce physical fights erupt and the throwing stones begins. These radical organizations were founded to accommodate those who love the street as their medium of intimidation. But recently, their method has developed. Streets and the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle in Jakarta fail to satisfy those who want to parade in the public as the most religious and pious Indonesians. In order to claim to be the guardians of Islam, their actions have found a new form. Last week, they came to Salihara house, South Jakarta, halting a discussion forum where Irshad Manji, a Canadian Muslim feminism activist, was arranged to speak before Indonesian readers during the launch of her book about God, love and liberty. The police, on the other hand, supported the logic employed by those who wore white hats and motorcycle helmets. There were thousands of reasons fabricated in order to stop the discussion. The legality of the foreign speaker, the permit from the authorities and the possibility of the event provoking public outrage, just to mention a few, were the reasons given to cut short the discussion. Those who hold power never want to lose face. Many on Facebook, Twitter and other social media wonder why the police sided with those who trespassed on other’s property with threats and intimidation. Nobody knows the true answer. But a Jakarta-based Muslim intellectual and a friend of mine, during my research interview for my next book, tentatively titled Apostate in White Robes, told me that conspiracy theories seem to ring true with regard to mutual cooperation between authorities and radical mass-based organizations. This is a secret, but I am sure many already heard the following story. Simply put, there is nothing new about this. In a police raid on the house of the FPI (Islamic Defenders Front) leader Muhammad Rizieq Syihab, some documents were confiscated. The documents revealed cooperation between a top retired general who founded a political party and the leader of the Islamic vigilantes. One may be led to conclude that their thuggery was not triggered by a certain level of stupidity, but rather by a smart and calculated strategy. Indeed, they are not mere dumb puppets. They know politics and how to play their part in a political game. Their arguments to justify their moves are sophisticated enough and supported with legal terms. The leaders of these hard-line organizations also know how to sell something to politicians; in return they receive both financial benefits and protection. Many have speculated that such groups have links with the police and state intelligence, although these claims are difficult to substantiate. Conspiracy theories go further to claim that these vigilantes are no longer used by the current government. They often take to streets and intimidate people just to attract the attention of the government and the people as if to say “Look, we still exist!” Ironically, the way the police handled the vigilantes in action is far different from the way they handled recent student demonstrations. During the mass protests against the government’s plan to increase fuel prices held at various campuses, the police displayed a stern attitude. In a big “chaotic” demonstration, some students were chased. They sought shelter in campuses, looking for safety by mingling with other students. But as soon as the police found them, the students were beaten black and blue. A number of brave but unarmed lecturers tried in vain to stop the torture. In the recent tragedy at the Salihara house, the police simply fulfilled the vigilantes’ demands. The discussion was halted. Irshad Manji was rushed out. The organizer of the forum was summoned for interrogation (The Jakarta Post, May 5, 2012). Where is the government, whose duty is to enforce the law? By maintaining his trademark inaction, cool and Javanese wisdom of silence, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has put the government on auto-pilot mode. The public is curious if he will let both ideologies fight and take sides when the winner emerges. But for sure, if he does not comment, he is safe and his image remains clean. No comment from SBY on the persecution of minorities, from Lia Eden’s torture and jail sentence to church’s controversies in Bogor and Ahmadiyah people’s torture and attacks on their mosques constitute this auto-pilot mode. One lesson from the Salihara tragedy can be learned. Due to the absence of the authority’s protection, the local people of Pontianak, Kalimantan rejected the FPI by force, setting an excellent example. The following day, another forum featuring Irshad Manji was held by the AJI (the Alliance of Independent Journalists) in Kalibata and guarded by the Banser (the youth wing of Indonesia’s largest Muslim organization, Nahdlatul Ulama). The Islamic vigilantes did not have the guts to approach closely and bother the forum (The Jakarta Post, May 6, 2012). Since the country is on auto-pilot, just arm yourself to protect your own safety.

"Tue, May 8 2012",Impotent govt lets FPI run rampant: Top criminologist,"The involvement of the hard-line group, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), in multiple violent vigilante actions shows how the government cannot run the country, a top criminologist says. “The Regional Administration Law clearly stipulates that the Home Ministry and the National Police must manage and monitor mass organizations,” University of Indonesia criminologist Bambang Widodo Umar told The Jakarta Post on Monday. Both state institutions should be held responsible for the unchecked violence perpetrated by vigilante groups, he added. Bambang said that President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono should be confronted publicly about his confusing stance on mass organizations, adding that Yudhoyono had done little to enforce the law against illegal actions perpetrated by groups such as the FPI. In the latest incident involving Muslim hard-line groups, several Islamic organizations reportedly threatened to use force to close the Catholic pilgrimage complex in Gedangsari, Gunung Kidul, in Yogyakarta for its alleged use by Christians for proselytization. More than 100 police officers from Klaten, Central Java, were deployed to safeguard the house of a priest in the nearby town of Wedi, whose parish manages the pilgrimage site. “We were informed that these organizations wanted to come here and show their anger. That’s why 100 police officers guarded us. But it turns out that nothing happened,” said the priest, who declined to be identified for fear of reprisals. The priest said that the problem began two months ago during a meeting of religious leaders in Gunung Kidul, when Muslims asked if the pilgrimage site was built without a permit. The priest said that he told the people at the meeting that the church had been waiting for a permit to be issued for three months. “However, all of a sudden, an issue was raised that the site was being used as a proselytization camp.” A public sermon was organized by nearly a dozen Islamic groups near the site on Sunday, the priest said. People speaking at the sermon told the crowd that the truth about the proselytization rumors had to be determined, the priest said. Ten representatives were then sent to “inspect” the site, he added. Separately, Yogyakarta Police spokeswoman Adj. Sr. Comr. Anny Pudjiastuti confirmed that a public sermon had been organized near Gedangsari by the Indonesian Mujahideen Council (MMI); the FPI; and Kokam, the youth wing of Muhammadiyah; among others. Pudjiastuti said the police had not received reports of proselytization or of attempts by vigilantes to seal off the site. FPI leaders have declined to comment on whether the FPI participated in the sermon. Munarman, a coordinator for the Islamic Defenders Legion (LPI), an FPI affiliate, said that he was in the dark about the issue. On Sunday, an LPI member was killed in a brawl with local residents in Bogor. Also on Sunday, FPI members allegedly prevented the congregation of the Filadelfia Batak Protestant Union (HKBP) Church in Tambun, Bekasi, from conducting services. Members of the FPI also allegedly assaulted Tantowi Anwari, an activist from the Association of Journalists for Diversity (Sejuk), for wearing a T-shirt defending the churchgoers.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/08/impotent-govt-lets-fpi-run-rampant-top-criminologist.html,,2012
"Tue, May 8 2012",Editorial: Freedom to silence,"Contrary to everybody’s hopes to see the fruits of reform within the National Police, Friday’s dispersal of a discussion at Salihara Cultural Center in South Jakarta suggests that the police have instead turned back the clock to the authoritarianism of the New Order. Rather than taking action against vigilantes who intimidated those attending the free-speech forum, the police scrambled for legitimacy to force an end to the event, which they alleged lacked a permit to feature a foreign speaker. The police were cracking down on Canadian activist Irshad Manji, whose latest book, Allah, Liberty and Love, was the highlight of the day. That the police considered the discussion illegal due to the absence of their prior approval amounts to an infringement of the Constitution, which protects individual freedom of speech. Nowhere in the country’s existing laws can we find a state institution or individual that has been granted the authority to silence others merely because of dissenting views. The Reform movement, whose anniversary we will celebrate later this month, has given birth to a series of laws that confirm the nation’s commitment to individual freedom, including the freedom of speech and expression. Enforcement of those laws has been a different story, however. The police’s contempt of freedom of speech on Friday came just after members of the hard-line Muslim group the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), picketed outside Salihara Cultural Center in a show of protest against reform-minded Manji, citing her liberal views, including the conformity between Islam and homosexuality, which they feared could undermine Islam. In her book, Manji calls for separation between Islam and culture and a reinterpretation of Islam itself — progressive thoughts that conservative groups such as the FPI apparently cannot tolerate. It goes without saying that the Salihara incident sends the wrong message that the police would listen to the cause of a group that has no hesitation to resort to violence — in the name of God, no less — to settle differences, more than they do to people who fall prey to acts of thuggery and are therefore are in need of protection. This has long raised suspicion of a link between the police and the group, which critics say is no different from thugs who seek income from protection rackets. Police have frequently denied allegations that the force was behind the rise of radicalism that ironically supported the flourishing democratization in the country. The police might argue they stepped out to prevent the FPI members from going on a rampage, but, as often happened in the past, the failure to act against radicals will further encourage them to repeat the same display of brutality. Not to mention the lenient punishment handed down on members of the hard-line groups even for violence that resulted in deaths. At the end of the day the police, despite their constitutional responsibilities for protecting people in exercising their freedoms, are perceived as representatives of the state that are stifling the freedoms themselves for the sake of “stability”, which is exactly the mantra of the New Order. If last week’s hard-liners, with the police condoning their action, can intimidate and silence a small group of people, tomorrow or next time they will feel free to deprive more citizens of their freedom of speech, thought, expression and perhaps their right to live. We fear that someday people will break their silence and take whatever action they deem as fair reprisal.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/08/editorial-freedom-silence.html,,2012
"Tue, May 8 2012",Issues of the day: No religion endorses homosexuality: FPI,"Freedom of speech: Irshad Manji, author of Allah, Liberty and Love autographs her book on the sidelines of a discussion at the office of the Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) in Jakarta on May 5. Police had previously dispersed a similar discussion at the Salihara building in South Jakarta. (JP/Ricky Yudhistira) May 6, Online Islam Defenders Front (FPI) spokesman Munarman said that residents rejected Canadian Muslim activist Irshad Manji for her views that Muslims should embrace lesbianism. Munarman said Saturday that his group disregarded Irshad’s sexual identity but rejected her spreading of the principle, adding that her liberal standpoint was unacceptable. “We don’t mind her sexuality as long as she keeps it to herself. However, as she decides to spread her views [that Islam should accept homosexuality], it is a different story,” he told The Jakarta Post. Munarman was responding to a query over the termination of Manji’s book launch discussion at Salihara in South Jakarta, on Friday evening. The police claimed that they broke up the event because the committee had no permit to invite a foreign national to the event and dozens of people claiming to be residents complained about the activist’s sexual orientation. Munarman, a former activist with the Legal Aid Institute (LBH), said that some residents who were members of the FPI rejected Manji because of her views that Islam should be open on issues of homosexuality. He insisted that the Muslim community was not the only group who refused Manji’s viewpoint, saying that “not a single religion in the world endorses lesbianism or homosexuality.” Your comments: FPI’s comment about endorsement of homosexuality theoretically is correct. However, we are talking about religions that were established over 2,000 years ago and that have never managed to evolve with humanity and society, and are stagnant. Luckily, many societies, individuals and countries have managed to evolve and have not stagnated in their development. Jorith Arbier Jakarta Whether you like FPI or not, is a different story. But, he is absolutely correct in stating that no religion endorses homosexuality and lesbianism. Unless otherwise you can prove him wrong, I suggest you to post no further comments. If not, I suggest you also file a complaint with the Pope and his holy church for objecting to condoms, homosexuality, lesbianism, and for forsaking companionship. Dominique La Touche Sydney Allah’s blessing will come to Indonesia, if there is peace and freedom of expression. Tasusayumi US I am sad to read this news. First of all, I am sad because instead of protecting the citizens who are having an intellectual, non-violent discussion, the police chief took the hard-liner’s side, and even yelled and intimidated the discussion’s participants. Second, I am sad to see the way these hard-liners convey their arguments: by howling derogatory comments at Irshad and by creating vandalism. If you don’t agree with something, you can always speak nicely and use logical arguments instead of aggression. And yet, when I reflect on Indonesia’s situation, maybe the marginalization and the socioeconomic condition of these hard-liner groups prevent them from being able to conduct a proper dialogue. Again, we go back to the whole mismanagement of our country: if only proper education was available for everyone, if only social marginalization and inequality could be reduced, I believe that these hard-liner groups would cease to exist. Instead, with proper education and social security, people could have enough tools to be able to discuss and refute ideas in a civilized manner. Reality, however, shows otherwise, and as long as education and socioeconomic conditions aren’t addressed, this sort of aggression in public will continue to flourish. Sebastian Partogi Jakarta It is time that Indonesians who do not agree with this ignorance and hypocrisy (selective freedom of speech) make themselves heard – otherwise it looks if they all agree, which I doubt. I am quite conservative myself, but if people want to promote another way of thinking or have other values, I respect and at least let other people hear and read what they have to say.

"Wed, May 9 2012",‘Little Monsters’ growl over threats to Gaga,"The fans of American pop singer Lady Gaga, known as Little Monsters, are refusing to bow down to threats from hard-liner groups, such as the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), if they attend their idol’s concert in Jakarta next month. Vina, the founder of Gaga’s Twitter fan-base for Indonesia, which has tens of thousands of followers, said that fans were not bothered with the FPI’s threats because they knew Gaga would never cancel her show due to threats “from seriously narrow-minded people”. “They judge others based on what they wear and how they look,” the 19-year-old student told The Jakarta Post. The singer and songwriter, notorious for her unconventional style of clothing, is set to perform in the capital on June 3 at the Bung Karno Stadium in Senayan, Central Jakarta. The concert is one of the first stops on Gaga’s world tour titled “The Born This Way Ball”, which is slated from April to October. Vina added that the FPI’s protest had nothing to do with Gaga’s artistry, but was against “her support and acceptance of gay, lesbian and transgendered people”. Vina was responding to the FPI’s threats to drive away fans who will gather for the concert. The chief of the  FPI’s Jakarta branch, Habib Salim Alatas, has said that he would also deploy FPI members to intercept the singer upon her arrival at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang, west of Jakarta. “We refuse to have Gaga’s feet touch our land. She’s bringing the faith of Satan to our country and thus will destroy the nation’s morals,” he told the Post. During her April 27 concert in Seoul, rallying conservative Christian groups condemned Gaga — who won a total of five Grammy Awards, three of them were earned last year — for supporting homosexuality and pornography. Ali, a 26-year-old banker in Bandung, West Java, said: “Nothing can stop me from meeting my queen.” Ali, an openly gay man, said that preventing the singer from performing in Indonesia “will not make gay people turn straight”. Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto said that the police would verify the artist’s permission to perform, adding that they would examine “public reaction” toward the 26-year-old American singer, born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta. “We will have to verify her permission to perform, where she will be staying and how many crew members [she] is bringing to the country,” he said. Police say organizers from the concert’s promoter Big Daddy have yet to officially confirm the concert schedule with them. More than 30,000 concert tickets, which price range from Rp 465,000 (US$50.75) to Rp 2.25 million, have been sold since ticket sales opened on March 10. Promoters had previously said that they were aiming to sell 40,000 tickets. Representatives of Big Daddy declined to comment on the issue. A marketing executive of the youth-oriented radio station Prambors said that it would continue to air Lady Gaga’s songs due to her popularity. Junas Miradiarsyah of the Integrated Promotion Prambors Network said that Prambors would not go “to extremes” in case of a backlash against the station. Junas said that Prambors, as a member of the media, could play a n “educational role” in helping youth judge “what is good or not”.

"Wed, May 9 2012",Attacks against Irshad Manji — ‘Jagoism’ at its best,"Canadian Muslim author Irshad Manji has been threatened and attacked in Jakarta by Muslim militias, including the well-known Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Is it a kind of neo-fascism in action, or an expression of Muslim majority sentiment and fear, or both at the same time? There is nothing really new about these sorts of assaults. Attacks against individuals or groups that are seen somehow as odd, distinct or separate sort of people have become increasingly common as those who represent a real community or even aspiring to lead them, fall outside of the idealized world of some mainstream groups. At a more profound level, however, the individuals and groupings being attacked are perceived by their aggressors as deviating from, or threatening, the “normal pattern of human life”, and are subsequently de-humanized by their critics who use terms such as “incomprehensible”. As anthropologist Mary Douglas ( 1966 ) has argued, writing about dirt, purity and danger, such marginal societal groups are “out of place”, and therefore, ought to be “out of sight”. Historically, the dehumanization and persecution of minority groups is unfortunately rather common. The Nazis used similar rhetoric in the 1940s when they wanted to annihilate what is nowadays called the LGBT community. In the 1980s, the Indonesian Military wanted to get rid of petty criminals, known as the Petrus killings of the Gali-Gali, not least because the latter were marked by tattoos, which were seen as an abomination by those dressed in neat official (military) uniforms. Some even justified the 1960s massacres by rhetoric that referred to inhuman enemies. In other words, “incomprehensible” sexual or gender orientation, “conspicuous and distortive” bodily markings, and “extreme” political deviation were in those cases functioning as political or spiritual challenges, or both, to the state authorities or those oriented toward the powers that be. What is new with the recent assaults against Manji is that these attacks are coming from nominally majority groupings, who are increasingly acting like minorities driven by a greater need for recognition and increasing claims of a monopoly of authority over what they convey as purely religious messages. However, as I have earlier argued in this paper (Feb. 27), the FPI and other Muslim militias can be seen as new jagos (fighting cock). Physical acts and appearance are important for these groups, and according to eyewitness reports, both were key features of the way they forced their way into the Salihara Cultural Center by destroying the fences and trying to convey their messages. It’s an expressive act of jagoism at its best. Only a few weeks ago, Manji had also been assaulted in Amsterdam at a public debate introduced by Dutch Green Left Muslim-liberal politician Tofik Dibi. The event was disrupted by Belgian Muslim radicals. Manji, but also the organizations that invited her, should have known what could happen and taken some precautionary steps. In Amsterdam, the discussion continued after the police arrested the radicals. By contrast, the local police in Jakarta, using bylaws on foreigners as a pretext, tried to appease the violent radicals by urging the institutes and the public to stop the discussion. Many have hoped for too long for higher state authorities to act decisively. It is time for Indonesian civil society to survey and seriously investigate the phenomenon of Muslim jagos. As the generals who supported their founding in the late 1990s are now becoming routine politicians, we should work to understand who provides resources and support to these kinds of militias, what steps can be taken to minimize their violent acts and what sanctions the state should take against its own institutions, that were either unable or unwilling to take action to protect the constitutional rights of its citizens.

"Wed, May 9 2012",Discussion dispersal threatens democracy,"Freedom of speech was again violated when a group of hard-line Muslims, backed by local residents, forcibly halted a discussion that marked the launch of an international book that promotes critical thinking about Islam last week. It was not the first time the notorious hard-line militia groups like the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) successfully curbed freedom of expression in Indonesia’s public sphere. The FPI was also the driving force behind the closure of Playboy Indonesia magazine and the prosecution of its then chief editor, Erwin Arnada, an incident that incited global alarm about freedoms of the press in the country. The latest attack on freedom of speech, which featured female Canadian author and journalist Irshad Manji, was a pummeling slap in face to Indonesia because it happened when international accolades were showered on the country’s vibrant democracy and emerging economy. The act of civilian oppression has not only discredited Indonesia’s billing as the largest Muslim democracy in the world, but more than that, it threatens the country’s consolidation of democracy. The forcible dispersal of public discourse, backed by the police, provides disincentives for people to participate in any discussions in public spheres, which are supposed to gather ideas and contest them by use of common sense, in the absence of narrow interests and intervention by other parties. Following the event, public discourses that scrutinize dogmatic Islamic values are unlikely to occur as people are worried about intimidation by the radical groups. Such situation is reminiscent of the New Order era under Soeharto, when people feared the discussion of current affairs in public, especially those critical of Soeharto, his family and cronies. While Soeharto made full use of the state’s intelligence structures to control the public sphere, hard-liner groups have since taken over that role. The FPI, to some extent, embraces a similar strategy as it exerts its domination over the public sphere by the use of violence. The group also expands its presence nationwide, although the move sometimes is met by public opposition, as the case of the foiled opening of FPI chapter in Central Kalimantan a few months ago showed. The establishment of additional FPI branches is part of democracy and should be respected; however, several experiences suggest that their presence often limits public discourses that conflict with their views on the issues of reformation of Islamic thought and the exercise of freedom. The situation has worsened as the state apparatuses, which are vested with the power by the Constitution to protect freedom of expression, often allow undemocratic activities to occur, if not condone them. The police tend to give the hard-liners favors for some reason. Some have suggested this preferential treatment stems from allegations that the FPI is backed by powerful military and police figures, although these claims need to be investigated further in order to determine whether such figures are still within the current formal structure of military and police. The other reasons may include the fact that local police are often required by their superiors to maintain stability, and failing to do may result in officers being shown the door. Last but not least, local police chiefs are often afraid of being branded as insufficiently Islamic if they stand up to hard-line groups. Interestingly, the last reason was also behind mushrooming implementation of sharia laws in many parts of Indonesia. A study by Melissa Crouch titled “Religious Regulations in Indonesia: Failing Vulnerable Groups” in scholarly journal The Review of Indonesia and Malaysia Affairs shows that many sharia bylaws in the regions have been implemented in the past few years as a result of politicians’ perceived needs to curry favor with their constituents. The failure to support the conservative cause in the public sphere will result into being branded not Islamic enough, which may cost them people’s votes. This particular psychological aspect explains why the state structure, in the form of legislators and police apparatuses, tends to back ultra-conservative causes on the issues of sharia laws and private morality, which certainly decreases the quality of public sphere. The only way to improve the quality of the public sphere — crucial for the establishment of democracy — although it may sound cliché, is through the fair creation and equal enforcement of the law. According to German philosopher Jurgen Habermas, the state should help create proliferation of public discourse by creating a set of rules that assure everybody is free to participate; everybody can participate on an equal footing in the public sphere; there are no restrictions of topics; and last but not least, the public sphere is free from state, corporate, or religious intervention. If those conditions are met, public discourse in the public sphere will result in better outcomes of public policy, better understanding of topic matter and will enlighten members of the public, which improves the lives of all. Unfortunately, the fresh incident in the Salihara compound on Friday shows that the state has failed to protect the purity of the public sphere, marking a setback for Indonesian democracy.

"Thu, May 10 2012",Issue : ‘We reject all foreign artists revealing skin’,"Going Gaga: Lady Gaga is welcomed by fans upon her arrival at Narita International Airport, east of Tokyo, on Tuesday. The American singer is on an Asian tour and will hold three concerts in Saitama, north of Tokyo. AP/Shizuo Kambashi May 6, Online The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) insist that the group has been protesting the presence of all foreign artists who they deemed as promoting “revealing clothes” in Jakarta, not just American singer Lady Gaga. FPI spokesman Munarman said on Saturday his organization demanded the promoter cancel the controversial singers’ upcoming concert in June. “Who said that we were just protesting her [Lady Gaga’s] concert? That was the journalists’ fault for not asking us about the matter in the first place,” he said. Munarman was responding to a question on why his group did not reject other performers such as Japanese band L’Arc-en-Ciel and South Korean group Super Junior, who recently held a concert in Jakarta.

"Fri, May 11 2012",The future of Islamic intellectualism in Indonesia,"In a show of force, members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) broke up a book launch and discussion featuring Canadian Muslim feminist Irshad Manji at the Salihara Cultural Center in Jakarta on May 5. It was said that the FPI accused Manji of violating a primary tenet of Islam by promoting homosexuality. Viewing the incident in a bigger picture, the unjustified action is linked to a series of efforts initiated by Muslim hard-liners in the last few decades to circumscribe and restrict the intellectual activities focusing on Islamic matters. It is not an atypical case that these vigilantes would exert physical force and violence to intimidate or dissolve public discussions, seminars, lectures and book launches. The situation is, of course, unfriendly to any intellectual and academic activity. The 2005 Indonesian Ulema Council’s (MUI) edict prohibiting secularism, liberalism and pluralism has been widely used by the hard-line groups to justify unlawful actions. Regardless of the diverse philosophical understandings and political implications, the edict narrow-mindedly defined those “-isms” as potentially corroding the holy and sacred essence of Islam. Put simply, the edict itself epitomises this anti-intellectualism, which clearly violates the freedom of religion and freedom of speech, the primary features of a democratic society. Surprisingly, these intolerant efforts seem to gain lots of sympathy from the wider Indonesian Muslim community. The general but ahistorical attitude embraced by the majority of Muslims to treat Islam as a final, fixed and single entity since it was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad 14 centuries ago is considered the major cause of this predisposition. It supposes that any action accounted for a violation of the basic tenets of Islam should be automatically banned. On the contrary, any action in the name of Islam, though convincingly conducted against the law and/or violently attacking the rights of others, is likely to be permitted. It can be exemplified by the different fates of the FPI and the Liberal Islamic Network (JIL). The two are now a binary icon depicting the conservative and the progressive groups fighting against each other in the contemporary Indonesian Muslim community. The FPI has been blamed for numerous unlawful and violent attacks and public intimidation against people or things defined as un-Islamic or the enemy of Islam, while the JIL has been accused by the public as a trouble-maker through its dissemination of controversial ideas questioning Islam as the perfect way of life. The fate of the two groups can be examined on the basis of two public movements against them spread earlier this year, Indonesia Tanpa FPI (Indonesia without FPI) and Indonesia Tanpa JIL (Indonesia without JIL). The former was fading away as quickly as the latter emerged and gained massive support from the majority of Indonesian Muslims. Despite the fact that members of the JIL have never been charged with any crimes or unlawful actions, numerous mass rallies and cyber campaigns were launched against them. It is suffice to say that the fact illustrates the recent domination of religious conservatism, which undoubtedly would restrain the development of Islamic intellectualism in Indonesia. The attempts to reform and revitalize such obsolete Islamic doctrines in accordance with the religious plurality and societal modernity of Indonesia would easily be deemed as an act of heresy. The efforts to repress religious intellectualism are not a new phenomenon. Hinted in his 2011 book, Cosmopolitans and Heretics, Carool Kersten examined the life and work of Nurcholish Madjid, popularly known as Cak Nur, one of the most prominent progressive Muslim scholars ever born in this country, who died in 2005. Together with Egyptian Hasan Hanafi and French-Algerian Mohamed Arkoun, Cak Nur embraced a cosmopolitan worldview and advocated religious tolerance and pluralism in Indonesia. Without doubt, he re-interpreted verses of the Koran and Hadith to be contextualised in the unique-cum-pluralistic cultures of this country. Unfortunately, this act saw him defined as a heretic by other Indonesian Muslim scholars. Related to the violent interruptions targeting Manji’s public discussion, the challenge against Islamic intellectualism seems to be getting worse. A witch-hunt-like operation perpetuated by FPI members has sent a clear signal of a dark future for Islamic intellectual activities. There are at least two major obstacles undermining Muslim intellectualism: The lack of political will and the inability of public officials to preserve the freedom of religion and free speech; and the silence of the majority — moderate Muslims — toward intolerant and violent actions perpetuated by Muslim thugs. Aside from the impotency of the government to act against groups of Islamic vigilantes, which is widely highlighted by printed and digital media, the fact that the majority of Muslims were silent must be paid more attention. Here, Manji was correct. As she persuasively delineated in her first book, the trouble with today’s Muslim community is the unwillingness of the majority, who are religiously moderate, to take action against repressive, intolerant and violent activities in the name of the holiness of their religion. The majority of Muslims are the true owner of Islam and relatively free from any political and economic motives embracing this peaceful religion. But because adhering to a religion is always demanding unreserved obedience to religious rules and leaders, their disagreement with the unjustified actions carried out in the name of Islam could be easily muted. In short, while we may lose hope in the current regime tackling the current intolerant and repressive actions campaigned by Muslim thugs, we have to approach the majority of moderate Muslims to stand up against them. Only by winning the hearts and minds of the majority will we envisage religiously tolerant environment of exuberance for Islamic intellectualism.

Salihara in South Jakarta involving Canadian writer Irshad Manji due to alleged pressure from radical groups who accused her of promoting homosexuality: In response to what happened on Jl. Salihara in South Jakarta, I agree with this class action. I believe that every religion bans any kind of sexual maladjustment, including homosexuality, transexuality, and so forth. If so, to me Irshad Manji’s idea about promoting sexuality is against Pancasila. Ahmad Ghozali Majalengka Irshad Manji speaks of Islam. Has she forgot the Prophet Lot era, during which God cursed lesbianism and homosexuality? I agree 100 percent with the FPI, and like any other religions, Islam does not endorse lesbianism or homosexuality. The rule of Islam is absolute. It cannot be changed by any human. Ina Jakarta It’s a fact that 10 percent of the world’s population is homosexual. Get over it, people. I’m sure you can find better things to worry about if something as trivial as other people’s sexual orientation upsets you. Dan Jakarta Oh not again, please!

Sjeline Lukiman Is it in Indonesia? Oh wait, would there be any other place? Nugroho Latifolia First of all, to the FPI and police officers, homosexuality is not a lifestyle that can be “promoted”. Homosexuality is an inborn sexual attraction towards the same sex. You might see it as a deviation since most gay people are reticent to speak out about their identity due to society’s prejudices. Soon you’ll be surprised to find out that some of people around you are actually closeted gays who have suffered from years of constant silence. Second, you have power to disrupt the discussion, but you do not have the power to halt ideas of tolerance. People with hungry minds will always find ways to explore great ideas, either by reading books or through great works of art. So I am optimistic that the majority Indonesian people will not become narrow-minded.

"Sun, May 13 2012",The week in review: Unfree democracy,"This country continuously touts itself as being among the world’s largest democracies — a pluralist nation with a diversity of cultures, ethnicities and faiths living in harmony with one another. Proof on the ground, however, has shown otherwise. Fueled by opportunism and an uncourageous government not willing to stand firm on difficult issues, entrenched intolerance is seemingly advancing farther and deeper with every passing day. The unchecked emergence of narrow-mindedness seems more evident with each passing week. On the contrary, groups promoting conservativeness seem to be emboldened as their ruthlessness remains unchallenged. Rather than protecting free speech, last week police in Jakarta broke up a discussion featuring Canadian liberal Muslim activist Irshad Manji. By halting the discussion, the police effectively bowed to pressure from members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), who had picketed the discussion venue. FPI insisted that freedom of expression did not extend to Manji due to her support of homosexuality, which they insisted was not compatible with Islam. Jakarta Police denied that they acted on behalf of the FPI, insisting that the event was stopped because organizers lacked the permit to hold the discussion, which was necessary as the event was a public forum that involved a foreign national. The most tragic part of the “Manji affair” has been that she was even barred from university premises. Indonesia’s oldest university, Gadjah Mada University, has apparently forgotten that of all places, campuses should be the home of intellectual dialect. The UGM rector was reported to have decided on the ban the night before Manji was expected to give a talk at the university’s Center for Religious and Cross-cultural Studies (CRCS). The university cited security reasons, a decision which was met with condemnation given UGM’s long history as a bastion for academic free speech. CRCS Chairman Zainal Abidin Bagir, criticized UGM’s management, saying that by cancelling the talk, UGM had accommodated the demands of thugs who had opted for violence and threats rather than dialogue. If that were not bad enough, Diponegoro University (Undip) in Semarang, Central Java, and again Gadjah Mada University, also stopped students from holding activities discussing lesbian or gay issues. On Thursday, an Undip student group, Kronik Filmedia, was banned from screening Sanubari Jakarta (Heart of Jakarta) on campus. Officials banned the film, which had previously passed the Film Censorship Board and had been screened in movie theaters, for discussing the taboo-topics of ethnicity, religion, race and inter-group issues (SARA). The movie comprises 10 short films inspired by true stories of same-sex romance. The screening at Undip campus was to have been followed by a discussion with the film’s directors, actors and actresses. Undip deputy rector Warsito said that the university refused to grant permission for the screening to avoid community resistance. University officials had not seen the movie, he added. The issues of free speech are symbolic of a nation which rarely comes to terms with its own history. For example, it is only now that the horrific events surrounding the 1965 abortive Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) coup are being accounted for. The National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) said this week it had evidence that state officials were involved in the systematic prosecution of members of the communist party. Its preliminary statement is a precursor to announcing formal findings on June 3 when it is also expected to propose the establishment a Commission for Truth and Reconciliation (KKR). Komnas HAM previously announced interim findings of its investigation indicating that state officials under the Operational Command for the Restoration of Security and Order (Kopkamtib), led by former president Soeharto, were directly involved in a systematic campaign to eliminate communist groups in the country. On the legal front, Nunun Nurbaeti became the latest high profile convict as the Jakarta Corruption Court sentenced the wife of former National Police deputy chief Adang Daradjatun to two and a half years in prison for bribing lawmakers at the House of Representatives in the 2004 election of the Bank Indonesia (BI) senior deputy governor. The court, however, failed to mention whether the bribe money was from Nunun’s own pocket or from another source. Nunun paid out some Rp 20.85 billion (US$2.25 million) in the form of hundreds of traveler’s checks — each worth Rp 50 million — to dozens of lawmakers to swing the vote in favor of Miranda Swaray Goeltom as BI senior deputy governor. Though the panel of judges did not identify the benefactor, the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) vowed to track the individuals who funded the bribes. The close of the week brought us the tragic fate of the Sukhoi Superjet 100, which crashed on Mt. Salak in Bogor, West Java. Attempts were continuing as rescue teams tried to evacuate the remains of 45 people who were on board. The nation’s heart goes out to the families of those who perished. Indonesia’s economy continued to post steady signs of growth as the latest data revealed encouraging news. The overall economy and employment rate remained in positive growth territory thanks to increasing investment and household consumption amid the lingering global crisis that has weakened exports. — Meidyatama Suryodiningrat",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/13/the-week-review-unfree-democracy.html,,2012

"Tue, May 15 2012",No permit for Gaga: Jakarta cops,"The Jakarta Police say they will not issue a recommendation to the National Police to issue a permit for Lady Gaga’s concert on June 3 at Bung Karno Stadium in Senayan, Central Jakarta. “Although we have yet to receive any request for a crowd permit from the promoter, there’s a very slim chance the permit will be issued, because the National Police headquarters will only issue the permit based on our recommendation,” spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto said on Monday. Rikwanto said the decision was based on input received from groups who said Lady Gaga, famous for her hit singles “Poker Face” and “Bad Romance”, was not suitable for local audiences. “Lady Gaga indulges in revealing her body, dancing erotically, and spreading pornography,” he said, denying that the decision was made in response to hard-line Muslim groups. “It’s not like that. We’re looking at the big picture here, taking suggestions from many circles and groups. The final decision was then taken only after our own thorough consideration and deliberations.” One infamous hard-line group, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), has fervently opposed Lady Gaga’s concert in Indonesia, saying that it would send its members to intercept the American singer when she arrived at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang, Banten. “We refuse to have Gaga step on our land. She’s bringing the faith of Satan to our country and thus will destroy the nation’s morals,” the chief of FPI’s Jakarta branch, Habib Salim Alatas, said. The FPI said the group had been protesting the presence of all foreign artists who they deemed wore “revealing clothes” while performing in Jakarta, not just the American singer. Born Stefani Joanne Angeline Germanotta, Lady Gaga, a Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter, is famous for her eccentric dress and her support of gay rights. Lady Gaga’s concert in Jakarta would be one of the first performances in her world tour, “The Born This Way Ball”, slated to run from April to October. Local concert promoter Big Daddy Entertainment said more than 30,000 tickets priced from Rp 465,000 (US$50.75) to Rp 2.25 million have been sold for the gig since sales started on March 10. Big Daddy president director Michael Rusli said that the company remained optimistic on the concert. “This week we will process the permit with the Jakarta Police and the National Police. What has becomes the issue here is that many have misunderstood the performer and the show. We will explain this during the permit-making process.” Michael added that the concert had been endorsed by the Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry. Performances featuring foreigners must first obtain clearances from the Immigration Office, the Manpower and Transmigration Ministry and the Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry. Erie Posse of Showmaxx Entertainment said that after clearing those bureaucratic hurdles, promoters in Jakarta had to submit several additional permit requests to the National Police, the Jakarta Police, the appropriate municipal police headquarters, relevant police precincts and to the district where the event would take place. Then, and only then, would the National Police approve a concert, he added. Some of Lady Gaga’s fans, known as Little Monsters, voiced disappointment with the Jakarta Police’s decision. “I thought the police would help the show to run safely after the FPI’s threats. But what happened now is that they have agreed with the FPI to cancel the concert.

"Fri, May 18 2012",Urban Chat : Beyond the saga over Gaga,"Lady Gaga (AP) First, allow me to clarify that I am not and never was a fan of Lady Gaga. I find her public persona and antics overpower her singing and entertaining qualities. However, I do not hate her either so, Little Monsters, no need to assassinate me. Unless you have been living under some pre-civilization rock this week, you will have heard about the brouhaha surrounding the much-awaited, sold-out-in-hours, Jakarta concert of Lady Gaga. Slated for June 3rd in downtown GBK Stadium, it would have been her first concert in Indonesia and, at 52,000 seats, the largest leg on the current Asian tour. So much at stake. You betcha. The Islam Defenders Front (FPI), notoriously fancying itself a defender of Islam, raised objections last week, which ranged from Gaga’s sexy getups, her calling fans “little monsters” and her supposed worship of Satan to her causing the recent Sukhoi jet crash outside Jakarta. I pray none of the victims’ families heard that last hurtful bit. The fact that there are countless dangdut singers in skimpier clothes gyrating obscenely on seedy stages across Indonesia on a weekly basis, or how Gaga’s fans actually adore the moniker, didn’t matter to the FPI. That the outfit Gaga famously modeled on the cover of an international fashion magazine was actually designed by Indonesia’s own rising designer, Tex Saverio, didn’t matter either. In a democracy, everyone, including the FPI, is entitled to voice their opinions, however misguided or misleading. What democracy forbids is one group forcing its opinions on others, especially by violence. Hence the portion of taxpayers’ money allocated to keep police on the payroll in order to enforce law and order, and uphold democracy. What bugs me and should bother every Indonesian, Gaga fan or not, is that the National Police (Polri) have been so lenient toward the FPI and similar groups to the point of, as countless witnesses over the years have said, actually providing more protection to the perpetrators than to the very citizens whose worship or commercial properties were being ransacked and who suffered actual harm. Just look up Wikipedia for the FPI’s long, bloody list of violent incidents since circa 1998 and match it with victims’ accounts in the media. What should also bother us is the FPI’s recent graduation from religious fundamentalism to plain fascism. There was the airing of the religiously-themed movie “?” on a private TV station. Irshad Manji, a Canada-based Islam reformist, suffered attacks during public book discussions across Java, while her Indonesian book tour four years ago passed off peacefully. The fact that many Muslims willingly flocked to Manji’s book discussions, some of whom were assaulted by raging hardliners, didn’t faze Polri. Suddenly now hardliners not only tell us which God to worship and how, but also dictate what movie to watch, what book to read, and which music to listen to. As if the ongoing petitions and legal charges from the public meant nothing, Polri kept siding with the hardliners, deeming Lady Gaga unsuitable to Indonesian culture. I had no idea that Polri had branched out from public safety to art and culture. The Republic of Indonesia is secular by Constitution and, until recently, happily provided venues for Beyonce and Erykah Badu when they were denied admittance by Malaysia’s ulema council for archaic reasons. But these days, I ask, where are Pancasila and Bhinneka Tunggal Ika? I refuse to believe that the trained and well-equipped Polri, whose special unit Densus 88 has gloriously captured real terrorists, can be terrified of some baton-wielding, helmeted, band of white-uniformed hoodlums. I’m getting more inclined to buy the long-speculated theory on the FPI’s origins which, compared to other scenarios floating around, is easier to deduce and accept. Polri backs off, maybe because it can. Do yourself a favor. Google ‘Pamswakarsa’ to witness these hardliners in action as I have. Those rage-filled eyes, punch-ready hands, kick-ready limbs, profanity-laden shouts (interchangeably with God’s most sacred name), honestly, where’s the divinity in them? Take off their cloaks and turbans, and you’ll see common thugs. As a Muslim I’m insulted that hired brutes have the nerve to hijack my religion’s name and claim to speak on its behalf. Now look at the latest developments in Gaga’s concert. The official Indonesia fan club tweeted of a new agreement reached between the local concert organizer, Polri, MUI, and the FPI, in which the organizer agreed on ‘certain’ terms and conditions. 52,000 of Gaga’s fans may never know, or particularly care, about those extra terms, yet they should never forget that, concert or not, come June 3rd, the FPI has already won, with Polri’s full endorsement. The rest of you non-Gaga fans should note that whatever public engagement you want to hold in the future, be it a university debate, painting auction, sports match, or your nephew’s circumcision rituals, may need the FPI’s ‘agreement’ beyond official permits. My fellow Indonesians, urbanites and countryfolk alike, is that what we signed up and paid taxes for? Are 242 million of us, from hundreds of various ethnic groups across 17,000 islands, to allow such a tiny number of troublemakers to trample over the Constitution and squander 67 years of independence? Get off the couch, get out there. Speak out in real life. Join hands, get organized. Put aside your silly differences and petty arguments for now. There is a much bigger, more critical, fight at hand. Much more than Gaga, this is about the shared lives in Indonesia Raya, for which we all have divine human rights to go ga-ga about. While there remains, mind you, an Indonesia Raya.

"Sat, May 19 2012",House to summon police chief on violence,"The House of Representatives plans to summon National Police chief Gen. Timur Pradopo for failing to prevent numerous acts of violence against religious minority groups across the country. Benny Kabur Harman, chairman of House Commission III overseeing legal affairs and human rights, blamed the National Police for poor law enforcement and protection of minority groups. He said police condoned violent acts carried out by hard-liners, triggering human rights violations. “The police must not bow down to the Islam Defenders Front [FPI] or any other hard-liners,” the Democratic Party lawmaker told The Jakarta Post on Friday. The FPI notoriously uses violence to push its ideology onto others. The Cikeusik Muslim Movement, another radical group, has allegedly killed three members of Ahmadiyah sect in Banten. The Shiite community in Sampang, Madura, has been the target of attacks by another group. Christians have been banned from performing religious services in church buildings in Bekasi and Bogor, West Java. In some cases, arguments between groups turned violent despite the presence of police. Benny said the commission would have an internal plenary meeting on Monday to set the date for a meeting with the police. Fellow commission member Eva Kusuma Sundari expressed concern over the police’s bowing to the demands of hard-line groups to cancel or ban religious and cultural events that contradict their ideologies. “Hard-liners such as the FPI don’t have the authority to ban such events, but it’s obvious that the police have always complied with these violent groups. This is a democratic country and the police are obliged to protect the rights of all people,” the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) lawmaker said recently. The attacks on Canadian liberal Muslim activist Irshad Manji’s book discussions, in addition to a number of unresolved violations of human rights in the past, has tainted the image of a country that is globally recognized as democratic, the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) says. Komnas HAM chairman Ifdhal Kasim said recently that the escalating violence has not only disgraced the country’s commitment to uphold rights, but also put Indonesia’s membership and leadership of international organizations at risk. “Indonesia’s poor human rights record is mainly caused by the failure to enforce the law as the police have mostly chosen to evacuate victims of violence from ‘unwanted’ events instead of tightening security to prevent opposing groups from approaching them at all costs,” he said. In a summary of Indonesia published on its website, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) quotes Komnas HAM as saying that any education on human rights for law enforcement officials “had not demonstrated results. This was evident from human rights abuses committed by security forces, especially the police.” It also said that of 4,926 complaints it received in 2009, 890 were of concerns about police investigations and 177 questioned the legal basis for police detention. In a report to the UNHRC, Komnas HAM identified cases, like the May 1998 riots, that the Attorney General knew of but took no action. The UNHRC will begin a two-week review of Indonesia’s human rights record on Monday.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/19/house-summon-police-chief-violence.html,,2012
"Sat, May 19 2012",Letter : Democracy and Lady Gaga’s ban,"Michel’s letter (“I agree with FPI to stop Lady Gaga”, May 16) gives a strong and emotional argument in support of the decision to ban a performer. He should however reflect on the true meaning of a democratic state. In 1773, the French writer and philosopher Voltaire was faced with this dilemma and said: “I may not agree with what you say, but I shall defend to the death your right to say it.” Voltaire said this even before the downfall of the French monarchy and the introduction of their democratic principles of equality, citizenship and inalienable rights. So in summary, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) has a right to their views, Michel has the right to express his support, but Lady Gaga has the right to perform in democratic Indonesia.

"Mon, May 21 2012",Comment: The future of Islamic intellectualism,"May 11, p. 6 In a show of force, members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) broke up a book launch and discussion featuring Canadian Muslim Irshad Manji at the Salihara Cultural Center in Jakarta on May 5. It was said that the FPI accused Manji of violating a primary tenet of Islam by promoting homosexuality. Viewing the incident in the bigger picture, the unjustified action is linked to a series of efforts initiated by Muslim hard-liners in the last few decades to circumscribe and restrict intellectual activities focusing on Islamic matters. It is not an atypical case that these vigilantes would exert physical force and violence to intimidate or dissolve public discussions, seminars, lectures and book launches. The situation is, of course, unfriendly to any intellectual and academic activity. The 2005 Indonesian Ulema Council’s (MUI) edict prohibiting secularism, liberalism and pluralism has been widely used by hard-line groups to justify unlawful actions. (By Amika Wardana, Colchester, UK) Your comments: While it may be always argued that we need more moderate and intellectual societies, which promote religious tolerance, pluralism, secularism and the like, one has also to consider two main facts when one is considering why there is such hardcore opposition to such tenets. First and foremost would be that a society of peace loving moderates and intellectuals with too much religious tolerance would lead to religion, and thereby the power and importance of religious organizations, gradually fading. No religious ruling class would want to let this happen anywhere in the world. So clearly, they will always be opposed to anything that can cause or start a revolution that leads to a decline in their popularity, importance, respect or financial resources. Secondly, from the point of a religious context, in general intellectualism and religion rarely go hand in hand. Religion is a belief and faith system. Intellectualism is a rational thought process system where logic and free thinking rules. Religion could also be termed in some ways as blind faith. Intellectuals often do not have this. The rest will simply get more confused between logic and rationalism vs. blind faith and beliefs. While a healthy balance may be advocated between the two, intellectualism will lead to radical thinking and thus the fragmentation of religion, thus causing moral, social and cultural values to decline, which is disastrous. We’re now seeing this in almost all countries of the world. Johnny I agree with the writer. This repression against freedom of speech and intellectual exploration should be stopped. It’s a violation against human rights. Differences in religious doctrines should be approached with healthy intellectual argumentations, not by force and physical intimidation. Who is a man to assert or restrain others on how to relate with their god? I say that’s the true blasphemy, when one takes more authority than god himself. Unfortunately, the writer didn’t specify how to approach the moderate Muslim majority. Harry Mason There is no compulsion in religion (Koran 2 : 256 ).

"Mon, May 21 2012",Issue: No permit for Gaga: Jakarta cops,"May 15, p. 1 The Jakarta Police say they will not issue a recommendation to the National Police to issue a permit for Lady Gaga’s concert on June 3 at the Bung Karno Stadium in Senayan, Central Jakarta. “Although we have yet to receive any request for a crowd permit from the promoter, there’s a very slim chance that the permit will be issued, because the National Police will only issue the permit based on our recommendation,” spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto said on Monday. Rikwanto said that the decision was based on the input received from groups who said that Lady Gaga, famous for her hit singles “Poker Face” and “Bad Romance”, was not suitable for local audiences. “Lady Gaga indulges in revealing her body, dancing erotically and spreading pornography,” he said, denying that the decision was made in response to hard-line Muslim groups. “We’re looking at the big picture here, taking suggestions from many circles and groups. The final decision was taken following our own thorough consideration and deliberations.” One infamous hard-line group, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), has fervently opposed Lady Gaga’s concert in Indonesia, saying that it would send its members to intercept the American singer when she arrived at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang, Banten. Your comments: Personally, I am no fan of Lady Gaga at all. But I really feel sorry for all of her fans who won’t have a chance to enjoy her show. I feel even more sorry for our beloved Indonesia, which is in real danger of being taken over by hard-liners unless moderate Muslims and the rest of us finally take a tough stand against the intimidation and bullying. Tami Koestomo I don’t really care about Gaga or what the South Korean government did about the concert, I am just wondering about the Indonesian police. Why are they catering to the whims of hard-liners? Antono I agree: we should all watch a wayang performance. Dangdut has already been classified as too sexy and dangerous to our health. Herry Manoe If Gaga’s so bad, why would she encourage self-acceptance and self-worth? Erotic or not, it depends on how we see it. If Indonesians always have these negative thoughts, when will this country develop? It is also a shame that the FPI is acting in God’s name. Would God be proud to see them threatening others? Maria Sarafina I do not even like Gaga but this is retarded. I’m tired of how the police are like the whipping boys. They are unequipped to operate alone and should be placed back under the military. Deddy K There are people who want to watch Lady Gaga so they should be given an opportunity to see her. It’s their right to watch her. Why would the country prevent her from coming?

"Wed, May 23 2012",Gaga concert — to be or not to be,"US Grammy-award winning singer Lady Gaga can no longer maintain her poker face. She has finally broken her silence on the prolonged drama over her planned Jakarta concert, making notes of censorship concerns and threats of violence against her on Twitter. “The Jakarta situation is 2-fold: Indonesian authorities demand I censor the show and religious extremists separately, are threatening violence,” she said on Twitter on Tuesday. “If the show does go on as scheduled, I will perform the BTWBall [Born This Way Ball] alone.” One of the authorities she was referring to is Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali, who said last week that Gaga “indulges in pornography by wearing revealing costumes” and that she would have a negative influence on young Indonesians. The hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) has also expressed strong opposition to the singer, with one FPI executive, Salim Alatas, saying that Gaga brings “the faith of Satan to our country and thus will destroy the nation’s morals”. Gaga’s planned June 3 concert has been in limbo following objections by numerous conservative groups and the Jakarta Police’s aversion to recommend the National Police issue a concert permit. As the saga continues, the National Police came up with a solution — but with a twist. The National Police said Tuesday they would issue a concert permit for Gaga — as long the promoters got recommendations from the Religious Affairs Ministry and the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI). According to the 2002 Police Law, it is the National Police who have the authority “to issue a permit for and monitor activities involving crowds”. In response to the National Police’s solution, Adrianus Meliala, a University of Indonesia expert in security and police reform issues, said that the police needed no approval from the MUI or the Religious Affairs Ministry to issue a concert permit. “The police are the security authority — that is their coverage of work. They can’t just turn a blind eye to the security issue should the MUI not issue a recommendation for the concert, can they?” he told The Jakarta Post. Meanwhile, the Jakarta Police have relaxed their position, saying they were preparing between 2,000 and 4,000 officers to safeguard Gaga’s concert if it goes ahead. “Our stance is still the same: We won’t recommend the concert be held. However, as part of the National Police, of course we are ready to safeguard the show if the National Police decide that the show can go on as planned,” he told reporters. MUI arts and culture division head Cholil Ridwan said the organization would further discuss whether a recommendation would be issued in a leadership meeting. FPI spokesman Munarman said on Tuesday that Indonesian Christians should praise the FPI, as well as other Islamic organizations, for their campaign against Gaga’s concert. “Lady Gaga has obviously misused symbols of Christianity, such as the cross, in her work,” he said, citing Gaga’s song “Judas” as an example. Munarman was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a meeting with members of the House of Representatives’ Commission III overseeing law, human rights and security. The FPI and other hard-line groups went to the House to ensure House members supported the police’s initial decision to ban Gaga’s concert. Minola Sebayang, the lawyer of Gaga’s Indonesian promoter, Big Daddy Entertainment, said the management would unveil its final decision on whether the concert would be held or not, on June 2 — one day before the scheduled concert. “There will be no concert if the permit is not issued,” Minola said at the Jakarta Police headquarters. The Immigration Office has revealed that Gaga has already obtained a visa to enter Indonesia. (png) Margareth S.

"Mon, May 28 2012",Issue: Ministry gives blessing to Gaga concert,"May 24, Online The Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry has given support to US singer Lady Gaga’s planned performance in the capital on June 3, with an official saying that its recommendation for a concert permit to be issued has been sent to the National Police. The ministry’s director general for cultural value, arts and film, Ukus Kuswara, said Thursday that the government had given “its blessing” for the concert to go ahead as scheduled. Your comments: If the permit is not issued, the FPI will be very happy. The primary goal is to show the people that the FPI is controlling the National Police. If the permit is not issued, the FPI has successfully stopped democracy and the freedom of expression in Indonesia. Widya Utama It is an apolitical and sensible decision from the Tourism and Creative Economy Minister Mari Elka Pangestu, particularly from the perspective of Indonesia’s image abroad and tourism. However, the National Police should not have the role of de facto judge on issues of morality. They are the servants of the government in the enforcement of the law. The government must deal with matters like this according to clearly enunciated policy and the police implement, not take the role of lead agency. When ministers are requested by the police to provide them with “recommendations” it looks like the police and their religious affiliates are running the country, not the government. The police only have a responsibility for considering public safety and security on the issue of permits for public performances, not deciding, on grounds of morality, such as which entertainers are allowed to visit or perform in Indonesia. Following in the footsteps of the hostile reception provided to author Irshad Manji (by a radical minority) it is a sad indictment of the direction of intolerance that the RI is being propelled toward by radical minority views. Nairdah Humbaba I can still barely comprehend why the promoter should obtain an approval from MUI. Don’t get me wrong. I respect MUI. But as far as I know, MUI is not a government institution and has no regulatory authority whatsoever over this republic. And it’s not like the promoter is going to hold the concert at MUI’s office or at MUI’s other premises. And about the Religious Affairs Ministry, is Gaga going to pray or build a place of worship, so why does she have to get a permit from the ministry? If it is unlikely, if at all, why should they ask for a permit? Isn’t this a country whose Constitution grants religious freedom? Why should someone get a permit to pray? This ministry’s existence and function is against the Constitution. It has been used by the ruling regimes to oppress minorities and for financial gain by having a monopoly in haj travel management, and even corruption. Please note that I’m not a fan of Gaga. Even if she performs or not, I won’t watch since her music is just not my cup of tea. But I do protest the government for their obedience to radical groups. Wilson I do believe a lot of the opposition to Lady Gaga is bogus. It is based on bigotry and racial discrimination (anti-America). There are plenty of racy dangdut shows every night in the Jakarta area. Deedee S In any case, it is condescending to suggest that Indonesian audiences could only appreciate a show specially tailored to local tastes. Parisian audiences would not expect a Papuan music troupe to seek approval by wearing tuxedoes and ball gowns. International performers in New York are not normally advised on the need to invite a young local talent on stage with them in order to win favor from the audience. Jakarta music lovers are as capable as audiences elsewhere of appreciating performers from overseas. “Why is Lady Gaga not proposing to perform on Kuta beach in Bali in an open concert?” Kuta beach is not a suitable venue for a concert that would attract tens of thousands of fans. “Why is Lady Gaga not more tolerant?” Lady Gaga appears to be sufficiently tolerant already and some of her songs e.g. “Born this way” explicitly advocate tolerance. If only those trying to prevent Indonesians from seeing her show could be as tolerant.

"Wed, May 30 2012",Is this the beginning of the end for our civil liberties?,"Go Gaga: In this Nov. 6, 2011 file photo, Lady Gaga performs at the MTV European Music Awards 2011, in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Lady Gaga has canceled her sold-out show in Indonesia over security concerns after Muslim hard-liners threatened violence if the pop diva went ahead with her ""Born This Way Ball,"" promoters said Sunday. (AP Photo/Joel Ryan, File) Indonesia may have lost a lot more than the opportunity to see Lady Gaga when she canceled her June 3 concert in Jakarta last weekend. The episode could mark the beginning of the end for Indonesia’s civil liberties as radical groups continue unabated in their assault on the nation’s freedoms. Those who care about their freedom should speak up and fight to defend it rather than busily trying to distance themselves from Lady Gaga and whatever it is they believe she represents through her songs and stage appearances. The news that the American pop diva had canceled her Indonesian gig must have come as a huge relief to many people, most particularly the police. The prospect of a violent disruption by the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) as 52,000 “Little Monster” fans watched Lady Gaga at Bung Karno Stadium has now been averted. Thanks to her, police do not even have to deal with the dilemma of whether or not to issue a permit. They would be very unpopular with the conservative Muslims if they decided one way, or earn the wrath of her young fans if they went the other way. Lady Gaga has settled the dilemma for the police. She has rightly refused to comply with the strict requirements regarding her stage appearance in order to gain a permit, such as submitting in writing the songs she would sing and the costumes she would wear. And she must have had her fans as well herself in mind when she spiked her Jakarta date after police clearly stated that they could not guarantee her or her fans’ safety in view of the protests against her concert. The real losers in this episode, however, are not Lady Gaga and the 52,000 fans who had bought tickets (many of them will be heading to Singapore where she has apparently added another date to perform, free from FPI harassment). It is actually the nation that has been made so much poorer in terms of its freedoms. Contrary to what many people believe, even among those who have spoken for our freedoms in the past, the battle being waged by the FPI and Muslim conservatives was never really about Lady Gaga. The stakes were much higher. This was an assault on our freedom of expression. It certainly marks the return of censorship on artistic expression, not by the state as in the past, but by the use of raw mob power. Don’t be so shocked if all Indonesian and non-Indonesian performing artists from now on are required to submit their song lists as conditions for their permits. Before long, all types of gatherings will be equally subject to censorship. Coming so close on the heels of the FPI attacks on the promotional tour by Canadian liberal Muslim writer Irshad Manji, the assault on freedom of expression is now almost complete. The discussions of her book Allah, Liberty and Love in Jakarta and Yogyakarta, even those held on university campuses , were forcibly shut down by the FPI with the help of the police. Sadly, many Indonesians have been quick to dismiss these events as problems confined to Lady Gaga and Manji. Performing artists and scholars who should have been defending their freedom were instead busy distancing themselves. It did not escape their Indonesian critics that both Lady Gaga and Manji are defenders of homosexuality. This could be one reason why many people in Indonesia, where homophobia runs deep, would have nothing to do with them. But as Lady Gaga moves on with her performances elsewhere and sells more records, and as Manji continues to recruit followers for her moral courage movement, it is Indonesians who have to brace themselves for more assaults on their freedoms and civil liberties. Those who think that the assaults on freedom will stop with Lady Gaga and Manji, and who thus remain silent, are sorely mistaken. They are the ultimate targets, and victims. These two victories have only emboldened the FPI and similar radical Islamic groups to flex their muscles and torment those who don’t follow their strict moral beliefs. On a winning streak, they must already be planning their next move and targets. Just look at the current state of freedom of religion. The silence of the “silent majority” has allowed the FPI to harass, torment and even kill followers of religious minorities. The attacks became increasingly violent and the targets widened because no one, or only very few, spoke up in defense of the religious freedom of the minorities. Now freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are about to go the same way. Don’t bank on the police — the people sustained by taxpayers’ money — to come and protect our freedoms. In the attacks on religious minorities and in the episodes with Lady Gaga and Manji, police were part of the repression. A pattern is clearly emerging where religious conservatives are pushing their strict Islamist agenda at the expense of our civil liberties. Not only do they have representatives in government, in the House of Representatives and among religious scholars, they also have thugs working on the streets to impose their agenda by force. This raises a serious question about where Indonesia is now heading, 14 years after it got rid of the Soeharto dictatorship and launched the reform movement. Are we seeing the emergence of a new form of tyranny, one that is defined more by the strength of the majority? Where are those on the other side of the fence in this Indonesian version of cultural war? Will they rise up and speak out to defend Indonesia with all its plurality and the civil liberties needed to hold this nation together and moving forward? Or, will they just take these assaults lying down, as they have been doing?",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/30/is-beginning-end-our-civil-liberties.html,,2012
"Wed, May 30 2012",View Point: Gaga’s ‘gado-gado’: When blasphemy is best,"There are many words in the Indonesian language that start with “gaga”, such as gagas (to initiate); gagap (to stutter); gagau (to grope around in the dark); gagah (strong, sharp, as in “looking sharp”; bergagah-gagah to show off your strength) and gagal (to fail). All of these have some sort of connection with Jakarta’s recent Gaga-saga. The Big Daddy entertainment organizers gagas-ed a Lady Gaga show for June 3rd, the authorities got all gagap and gagau about it, conservative Muslims, such as the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) went out of their way to bergagah-gagah, and then did all they could to make the Lady Gaga show gagal. They succeeded — for now. Yes, Lady Gaga is a magnet for controversy. She’s been accused of spreading satanism and corrupting young people’s morality. She’s sexually vulgar and religiously blasphemous, so her critics say, and they revile her for outrageous performances. On the other hand she is the beloved of her many fans, engendering a worldwide Lady Gaga movement. Love her or hate her, Lady Gaga arouses strong passions. So far, people have looked at the Indonesian Gaga-saga in terms of freedom of expression, state authority and democracy. But is there deeper significance behind the intense reactions she has evoked? Why was she named one of the 10 most influential people of 2010? And why did she rise to fame when she did? First, let me state my position. I love Lady Gaga, in the same way I love all strong women who are not afraid to express themselves (remember Madonna’s 1989 song “Express Yourself” with its gender equality message?) in powerful, forceful and creative ways. And I love her because Gaga is like gado-gado! This is word that means not only the cooked vegetable salad with peanut sauce, considered one of our “national dishes”, but also something mixed or eclectic. Yep, Lady Gaga is definitely eclectic, creating an oversized persona from a cocktail of high and low culture, inspired by fashion, film, drag queens, heavy metallers and pop stars, as well as spiritual figures like Deepak Chopra. That’s what artists do. They use their skills — including lyrics, sound and performance — to take a snapshot explaining what it’s like to be alive in the times they inhabit. That’s why Lady Gaga is to the YouTube generation what Madonna and Michael Jackson were to the MTV generation — and the viral system of social networking has been a much more effective means of turning her into a global icon than the recording industry’s publicity machine. Lady Gaga’s ascendance began with the onset of the global financial crisis (GFC). Her outrageous, attention-grabbing acts were just what people needed to distract themselves from their economic woes. But it would be a mistake to reduce her creative commotions to mere diversion from hip-pocket pain. Her art resonates with audiences because she expresses and defines images, ideas, emotions and desires that are already in people’s minds and hearts. Today we live in a time of limitation, be it of material, natural or spiritual resources. Rampant capitalistic greed has created a chasm between the minority rich and the majority poor, not to mention environmental degradation. Those who benefit from the existing paradigm hang on to it tightly. The rest feel the future is bleak — doomed even — and want to change it. Hence the worldwide Occupy Movement. They’ve been criticized for not having an agenda apart from expressing dissatisfaction, but that’s only because the time is not yet ripe. Then, there are the desperados who act with reactionary fervor, either because they pessimistically feel their time might be coming to an end, or because they optimistically think vindication is just around the corner. The pessimists not only include the FPI and that ilk, but also the Church (plagued with corruption and sex scandals and, in the West, declining attendance) as well as the Santorums and Romneys of the world, of whatever faith. The optimists include the Facebook and Twitter generation who think the old guard is rotten, as well as women, many of whom have had it with patriarchal domination. Lady Gaga’s Born this Way, which is usually considered as a plea for LGBT rights, is also the anthem of a new generation who care more about social solidarity and the environment because their lives and future depend on it. Part of the reason why both Muslim and Christian reactionary groups have lambasted Lady Gaga as satanic is because she is a woman who dares to be herself, therefore copping the usual “witch” label. It’s ironic really. When groups like the FPI attack people or buildings are they being godly? No, of course not, and in the long run, they will lose because of it. Be prepared folks, as things will get worse before they get better. It will be some time before the Facebook and Twitter generation come of age in 2023 but they will bring a new set of values to the world’s leadership. The reason why Lady Gaga has such a huge following is not just because she’s giving the finger to the old guard, but also because she embodies the spirit of this coming generation. It’s a pity Lady Gaga didn’t make it to Indonesia. But who knows, maybe she’ll make the FPI even more famous by making them part of her next act!

"Fri, June 1 2012","Urban Chat : Hip, hip, hipsteria","If you’re one of those people, like me, who mainly associate “hipsters” as low-slung, bootcut pants, you may want to continue reading. If you already know the alternate meaning and loathe what it represents, please be informed that, since a campaign via Facebook last year, June 1 is officially Punch A Hipster Day, so you can go out and seize the day. If you’re a hipster, you probably wouldn’t be reading this column anyway because it would be, um, beneath you. The subculture originated by the late 1940s in post-WWII America, when disenchanted white youths found fresh air in jazz and blues, and the black musicians’ carefree lifestyle. Do note that segregation was still alive and well during that period — Rosa Parks didn’t refuse the bus backseat until 1955 and Martin Luther King Jr. announced his famous dream only in 1963 — so these youngsters’ foray into racial diversity was a bold, real, challenge to the prevalent norm and establishment, aside from being perceived as ahead of their time, of being “cool”. These anti-mainstream, rebellious white youth, dubbed “hipsters” in Norman Mailer’s 1957 The White Negro essay, also eschewed the comfort offered by then-flourishing middle-class life. The hipsters’ lives were immortalized in various music and literary works; perhaps most notably Jack Kerouac’s iconic, semi-autobiographic On the Road. Their spirit carried over to the 1950s apolitical Beats and spilled into the 1960s anti-war hippies. That chunk of history was pretty much my initial understanding, gained mostly through witnessing the revival of hipsterdom in the late 1990s while living in the US, scorned from Brooklyn to Seattle. Yet, aside from a fervent dedication to Pitchfork Media, wifebeater-plus-flannels — a la Urban Outfitters — or Wes Anderson films, I failed to sense a deeper, value-shifting angst beyond the classic case of struggling urban youths trying to cope with their better-fared peers. Suppose the new slew of twenty-something startup millionaires were much harder to chew than the usual preppy-turned-yuppie lot? Ironically, as a grad student I couldn’t afford most things in Urban Outfitters, so the revival failed to resonate with me. Lately I’ve found myself again in talks about them, surrounded by supposed hipsters and gasp, even having been mistakenly accused of being one. No Facebook or BlackBerry? Privacy and over-exposure factors. Vintage items? Aesthetics and quality. Yoga and organic foodstuffs? Health and, to some extent, vanity — I gain weight easily when slacking off. My frequent aversion to overly-hyped things? Perhaps I was raised well to think independently; perhaps I’m just a freewheeling Sagittarian. For all the aforementioned habits or hobbies there’s a solid personal reason other than a burning desire to shun mainstream choices. After all, for all my eco-conscious practices and somewhat careful consumption, I still travel mostly by air and built the largest part of my career in the fast-moving consumer goods industry. So I wonder; what actually defines today’s hipster? Someone who is into obscure forms of art and culture, someone who is always ahead of the trend, or both? In this age of 24/7 news cycle and ubiquitous Net access, all it takes is the luxury of free time in the comfort of your home to explore the virtual universe for the rarest, quirkiest things that might take your fancy, then spend more time to connect with likeminded souls and, factor in an Indonesian pattern of collectiveness, possibly spend even more time communing with these soul siblings in real life. As for being ahead of the trend, there’s a big difference between being a first adopter and a trendsetter. A first adopter is someone with access and resources to scour, snap, and sport the latest thing that, when in luck, may be the next trend. A trendsetter has an eye to identify something that may or may not be new, yet sport it with such panache that everyone else can’t help to notice and want to emulate, birthing a trend. If these are the prerequisites, then, except for pure unadulterated luck, today’s hipsters are mostly the ones with best access and resources (time, money and opportunities). Sounds like the good ol’ elites, doesn’t it? Especially since I can’t seem to sniff the underlying major bone to pick with, to rebel against, today’s pretty diverse, relatively democratic society. Admittedly Indonesia is still going through its growing pains, and there are medieval characters like FPI around, but there are laws in place, however insufficient, to protect the environment, prohibit discrimination and promote better living for the underprivileged. Worthy adversaries around are the likes of Somalian pirates, Colombian drug cartels and global religious fundamentalists, for which you need trained forces to fight. Challenging the 1 percent? Frankly, you might have a better shot by electing a new administration that will slap them through taxes. Hipsters tend to refuse defining themselves to us mere “squares”, while internally have been known to accuse each other being less original (a fiery Twitter spat after Jakarta’s L’Arc-en-Ciel concert comes to mind) or trying too hard to be hip (n+1 editor suspected of consciously avoiding the fate of Slavoj Zizek’s trendiness among philosophical name droppers, as I read). The 2003 Hipster Handbook was cheeky, but not much else. Perhaps, if I dare ask, is this all simply some hipster hysteria? While I’m waiting for enlightenment as to what today’s (Indonesian) hipsters are, let me rummage through the closet for that cool 1950s scarf. Have you heard? The movie of On the Road is coming.

"Mon, June 4 2012",Fans mourn the concert that never was,"In another world, US pop star Lady Gaga would have been at Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta on Sunday evening, performing her signature songs such as “Bad Romance” and “Born This Way” before tens of thousands of her loyal fans, known as “Little Monsters”. In reality, Gaga’s trip to Indonesia ended before it began, as her gig in the capital, part of her 2012 “Born This Way Ball” world tour, was canceled by her tour management in the face of pressure from the country’s hard-line groups. The New York-born singer, who held three days of concerts in Singapore without any censorship last week, made clear on Saturday via her official Twitter account, @ladygaga, that she regretted the cancellation. When one of her followers pointed out that Gaga would have been in Indonesia over the weekend if her Jakarta show had gone ahead as planned, the singer replied, “I know. It is all I can think about.” In Jakarta, her fans reminded the government that the bitter end of weeks of controversy over the gig was a huge loss not only for Gaga fans but also for every citizen who believed in freedom. “The cancellation was not merely an attack on our idol, but also on the values that she promotes through her music such as equality, humanism, diversity and compassion,” said Fia Rahmatia, 20, founder of Gaga Twitter fan-base @IndoProGaga. The Twitter account had a total of 6,927 followers as of Sunday. “We decided to channel our rage in an artistic way,” Fia, a student of Parahyangan Catholic University in Bandung, added. Fia, along with around 50 Gaga fans from Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Bali and Bandung, gathered in front of the stadium where Gaga was to have performed on Sunday, bringing floral wreaths mourning “the death of freedom of expression” in Indonesia. The fans also performed a flash-mob dance as a tribute to the 26-year-old singer. They also stamped their handprints with colorful paint on a large poster of Gaga, which stated “Little Monsters’ tribute to diversity”. Separately, a dozen or so fans of Gaga, wearing black outfits, staged a rally in the form of a dance in front of the Presidential Palace, demanding that President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono guarantee citizens’ rights to freedom of expression. One of them, 18-year-old Agnes, said many “Monsters” were reluctant to show up at the State Palace out of fear that “groups like the Islam Defenders Front [FPI]” would chase them away. Their fears were unfounded as around 3,000 members of the FPI prayed together at their headquarters on Jl. Petamburan III, Central Jakarta, to celebrate the concert cancellation. “This is our way to thank Allah,” FPI spokesman Munarman said. Along with the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), United Development Party (PPP) and the Islamic People’s Forum (FUI), the FPI was foremost among the groups condemning Gaga, who it accused of “indulging in pornography” and “promoting satanic values” in her acts.

"Tue, June 5 2012",Issue: Beginning of the end for our civil liberties?,"May 30, p. 30 Indonesia may have lost a lot more than the opportunity to see Lady Gaga when she canceled her June 3 concert in Jakarta last weekend. The episode could mark the beginning of the end for Indonesia’s civil liberties as radical groups continue unabated in their assault on the nation’s freedoms. Those who care about their freedom should speak up and fight to defend it rather than busily trying to distance themselves from Lady Gaga and whatever it is they believe she represents through her songs and stage appearances. (By Endy Bayuni, The Jakarta Post) Your comments: There are two issues here: One is Lady Gaga and the other is freedom. One thing for sure is that the culture that Lady Gaga promotes is alien to us Indonesians. We do not like the way she behaves and we do not like the way she dresses. She does not know what is a good or bad influence, or the defective culture she is promoting. All she knows is entertainment and profitability. The other thing is freedom. There is no such thing as absolute freedom. Absolute freedom is destructive. Freedom has to be maintained within certain boundaries and constraints. And those boundaries and constraints are defined by our values, traditions and culture. While we may disagree, myself included, with the fanaticism of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), the views that they put forward have to be considered and weighed against what the majority of Indonesians want. If the majority wants Islam and its values to prevail, so be it. After all, that is what democracy is all about. Please do not compare Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. Indonesia is a democratic country while Saudi Arabia is not. And we are proud of Indonesia and her democratic achievements. Sigit Haryono Well, you basically need to educate the people. Millions of Indonesians live in villages. The only values they know are traditional values. Millions of others are wealthier and middle class; they don’t really care. The politicians don’t care either because they just want to get votes. A key solution for this is there needs to be a new political party that stands up for human rights and multiculturalism as their prime pillars. Such a party won’t win the election, but it can work effectively to put those things high on the national agenda. Currently, this is what we urgently need. Wishnu Prastya I agree to the canceling of the Lady Gaga concert if the risk of an attack from radical groups was high. From a Muslim perspective, the personality of Lady Gaga is contradictive of Islamic values and the actions of Lady Gaga action were seen to have underestimated Islamic values. Because of that, it was objective of the FPI and others to attack the Lady Gaga concert. In this context, it is not related to civil liberties in Indonesia. Toni Ervianto The end of Indonesia began with the sly introduction of so-called “sharia-based bylaws”. Edo E. There is no freedom without a responsibility and respect for others. If you go to someone’s house and start to do as you like because you believe that you have the freedom of expression. It will not surprise me that the very same person, who holds the same belief, will throw you out of the house because of your lack of character and self-respect. L. Rizal What we need is understanding! There is no more understanding in Indonesia. And most of our people see the reality but just can’t accept it because of their morals, dogma and other values that they know. Lady Gaga is a defender of the LGBTQ and this is the reason why she was rejected by the “silent majority”. Fanaticism by the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) is acceptable but on the other hand, we can’t blame them 100 percent. We also have our role in this dilemma. Come on, let us see through ourselves, contemplate and become a free people without denying our value as Indonesians.

"Tue, June 12 2012",FPI makes Gramedia recall book,"JP/ Nurhayati Hard-liner group Islam Defenders Front (FPI) reported publishing company PT Gramedia Pustaka Utama (GPU) to the Jakarta Police on Monday for circulating a book it claimed “defamed Islam”. FPI spokesman Munarman said that the book in question was the Indonesian translation of US theologian Douglas Wilson’s Five Cities that Ruled the World: How Jerusalem, Athens, Rome, London, and New York Shaped Global History. The Indonesian translation, entitled 5 Kota Paling Berpengaruh di Dunia, was published by GPU, a subsidiary of Jakarta-based media conglomerate Kompas Gramedia Group, earlier this year. “Passages on page 24 of the book put forward ideas of Prophet Muhammad PBUH as a thief and a pirate who raided caravans and ordered murders to take control of Medina,” Munarman told reporters. “This is clearly a defamation of Islamic teachings, as Prophet Muhammad PBUH symbolizes those teachings,” he said. The FPI accused GPU of violating Articles 156a, 157, and 484 of the Criminal Code on religious defamation, hate speech, and printing texts liable to criminal charges. The Code stipulates five years in prison for religious defamation, two-and-a-half years for hate speech, and one year for printing texts liable to criminal charges. Data from the police show that the FPI included the names of GPU chairman Wandi S. Brata, along with translator Hendri Tanaja and editor T. Herdian in their report. “We hope that our report will be followed up according to the law,” Munarman said. The case first entered the national spotlight when one of the book’s readers, identifying himself as Depok resident Syahruddin, wrote a letter about the alleged defamation that was published in Republika on June 8. Wandi replied to the letter the next day, also in Republika, saying, “[GPU] deeply apologizes for our negligence in publishing a translation of the book as it is.” Wandi continued by saying that the company had pulled all the books from circulation and would soon destroy them all. However, FPI Jakarta secretary Habib Novel said that he could still find the book at a Gunung Agung outlet at Arion Mall in Rawamangun, East Jakarta, on June 10. “I have submitted both the book and the purchase receipt to the police as proof that the book was still in circulation.” According to Munarman, cases like these cannot be solved by withdrawing the books from the shelves. “Religious defamation is a crime. Look at a corruption case — do you think the case is solved once the perpetrator says that he’s sorry?” Kompas Gramedia Group corporate communications director Widi Krastawan said that the company would review GPU’s production process thoroughly in the wake of the incident. “We will see what is wrong with the system and how such negligence can occur,” Widi told The Jakarta Post over the phone. He acknowledged that literal translations were problematic in translating a book from a foreign language to Indonesia. “A sense of language, social context and acuity on sensitive issues must also be considered in translating a book. I believe that there are much better choices of words that should have been used in this case,” he said. He reaffirmed Wandi’s statement that the company had done all it could to ensure that the book was withdrawn from circulation. “We even went to numerous book stores, even other chains, to ensure that the book is not on the shelves anymore.” The report was made close on the heels of the FPI’s strong objection to the plan to host US pop diva Lady Gaga’s concert, slated for June 3. The Jakarta gig would have been the singer’s first concert in Indonesia and, at 52,000 seats, the largest leg on her Asian tour. Backed by the police, the FPI condemned Gaga’s music for “promoting Satanic teachings”. The concert’s cancellation came after the FPI attacked a book tour by Canadian Muslim writer Irshad Manji. The discussions of her ook Allah, Liberty and Love in Jakarta and Yogyakarta were forcibly shut down by the FPI with the help of the police.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/12/fpi-makes-gramedia-recall-book.html,,2012
"Wed, June 13 2012",Letter : Gramedia recalls book,"In reference to the article entitled “FPI makes Gramedia recall book” published in the June 12 edition of The Jakarta Post on page 2, I conclude that freedom of speech has no meaning in Indonesia. What if I were to ask these religionists to prove that there is actually a god? And if they could not, then would these religions be declared fraudulent organizations for making statements as truths that have no basis in provable fact? “Wandi continued by saying that the company had pulled all the books from circulation and would soon destroy them all.” Book burning! Donate them to institutions of higher learning. Personally, I find all of the books by this author to be offensive. However, he has the right to think, write and publish as he sees fit. Brien Jakarta “The FPI accused Gramedia of violating Articles 156a, 157 and 484 of the Criminal Code on religious defamation, hate speech and printing texts liable to criminal charges.” Religious defamation? Then they should also object to all books publishing hadiths, which defame Muhammad, too. Hate speech? Oftentimes a crowd of violent people go on a rampage due to hate speech from a cleric. But very seldom are those clerics put in jail. Printing texts? All Wahhabi and Salafi magazines, newspapers and websites constantly defame all other religions and non-Wahhabi Muslims, but nothing is done against them.

"Thu, June 14 2012",Letter : Book banning in Gramedia,"Although it is distressing to see Gramedia caving in to the FPI and taking a so-called controversial book off the shelves, I am thankful that Indonesia does not in any way resemble (except perhaps in Aceh) the fanaticism and ignorance of religious intolerance and chauvinism. I worked in a Gulf country briefly and was constantly on alert for fear that whatever I might say could be overheard, misconstrued and, thus, lead to a flare-up with a local over an utterly inconsequential triviality of speech or thought. As a non-Muslim foreign national, I was well aware that I had virtually no rights whatsoever there and that in any sort of dispute my embassy would be of virtually no help at all because it wouldn’t want to jeopardize trade relations with a wealthy oil state for anything; governments can be spineless things. The bottom line is countries that allow freedom of thought and speech and association have more vibrant, productive economies, and, therefore, Indonesia should take a hard look at the economic and social dysfunction and blatant disregard for basic universal laws and human rights.

"Thu, June 14 2012",Gramedia burns books ‘defaming’ Prophet,"In an act condemned by critics as “superfluous”, publishing company PT Gramedia Pustaka Utama (GPU) on Wednesday symbolically burned around 200 copies of a book said to have defamed Prophet Muhammad. The book burning took place in the front yard of Bentara Budaya, a non-profit cultural center linked to the publisher, only two days after the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) reported it to the police and demanded it destroy all copies of the book. The Indonesian translation of US theologian Douglas Wilson’s Five Cities that Ruled the World: How Jerusalem, Athens, Rome, London and New York Shaped Global History (5 Kota Paling Berpengaruh di Dunia) had drawn the ire of several Muslim groups for describing the Islamic prophet as a thief and pirate. Nana Subianto of Kompas Gramedia community relations said the book burning, watched over by members of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), was a symbolic action to show Muslims that it was committed to eradicating the controversial book. “Other 2,500 copies were destroyed yesterday and today in storage,” she said. Nana said that the company had recalled the books from its bookstores immediately after a reader’s letter in newspaper Republika on Friday. “However, the company took this step so there would be no bigger problems in the future.” But some critics say that what Gramedia did went too far. A lecturer from Driyarkara School of Philosophy, B. Herry-Priyono, said the publisher should have scrutinized the translation of the book before publishing it but its decision to burn the books was excessive. Recalling the book should have been enough but the publisher chose to bow to the FPI’s demands, Herry said. “The FPI is no more than a group of tribal thugs that use any means to have its demands met and the police usually do nothing,” he said, adding that if this continued to happen, the radical group would be more demanding. Besides filing a report to the Jakarta Police, the FPI had also intended to visit GPU’s office, said Nana, but the plan was canceled.

"Fri, June 15 2012",Govt can take vigilante groups ‘to court’,"The government can go to court if it wants to disband vigilante mass organizations such as the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) for its members’ violent actions, several experts have agreed. Constitutional law expert Refly Harun said on Thursday, however, that the government could not of its own volition order questionable mass organizations to disband. “But the government can go to the district court or the Constitutional Court to file a lawsuit against their violent acts, and once the verdict is in, it would have to be final and binding,” he said. Ali Bachtiar, the director for mass organizations at the Home Ministry, said that based on the Mass Organizations Law, the government had no authority to disband FPI. “However, the government could file suit against FPI members and officials. But no action could be taken against the organization because the Criminal Code cannot be applied to institutions or organizations,” he said. Refly disagreed with Ali’s statement, saying that a district court could order the FPI disbanded if judges determined that the group ordered its members to use violence in its activities. Refly said that the Constitutional Court also had the authority to disband vigilante groups that violated the Constitution, which guarantees citizens the freedom of expression and assembly. The Central Jakarta District Court sentenced FPI chairman Rizieq Shihab to 18 months’ imprisonment in October 2008 for his involvement in the assault of activists at a rally at the National Monument (Monas).

"Fri, June 15 2012",Letter : Freedom of speech and religion for all,"Freedom of speech and religion are fundamental rights of all human beings. Lady Gaga should have the freedom of speech to say what she believes to be true, even if it is wrong. All Indonesian citizens have the right to freedom of religion and speech. We can’t all be right all the time. No one has all the truth. We all have our blind spots, including the FPI. The FPI denies the exercise of free speech and freedom of religion guaranteed by the Constitution. The FPI condemns Lady Gaga, denying her the right to perform, and the rights of their fellow Indonesians to listen to her music in a live concert. This amounts to FPI stealing the rights of others. This, along with violent attacks, is far worse than anything they are accusing Lady Gaga of doing. The FPI condemns Lady Gaga because in their view her music is “promoting Satanic teachings”. (The Jakarta Post, “FPI makes Gramedia recall book”, June 12) However, the FPI may also be guilty of doing the same thing and worse. The FPI may be promoting Satanic teachings and actions. What right does FPI have to deny the freedoms of speech and religion to Lady Gaga and her fans? Isn’t that hypocritical, unconstitutional and contrary to Pancasila? Isn’t it really the FPI who is acting in a Satanic way? Therefore, let’s “live and let live”, shall we? All should be able to celebrate the constitutional freedoms for which the Indonesian patriots gave their lives. If we have to think and believe just as the FPI tells us to, then isn’t it time to re-declare our independence from such tyranny? Some of the freedoms cherished by Indonesians are that of speech and religion. We will fight to preserve these freedoms now as in the past. We will also fight for the freedom of FPI members to believe and say what they want, and we expect them to do the same for others in allowing us the right and freedom to express ourselves. It is only fair that the FPI members allow others to read, believe, say and listen to what they want, and that includes freedom to go to a Lady Gaga concert if they wish, right?

"Sat, June 16 2012","Amid growing religious harmony, friction still occurs","Central Java has displayed a unique phenomenon in religious life as, although seeds of tolerance have been growing relatively quickly, signs of intolerance are also still high in a number of regencies and municipalities in the province, an NGO revealed on Friday. Social and religious study institute, eLSA, located in Semarang, noted that between January and June, eight religious conflicts had occurred across the province, although that figure was far lower than the number of 26 similar conflicts throughout last year. “Central Java is a comfort zone for the dissemination of tolerance. Yet, friction at a grass-roots level still occurs,” the director of eLSA, Tedi Kholiluddin, said in Semarang. Among the eight religious conflicts were the forced dismissal of the Majelis Tafsir Alquran (MTA) congregation by Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) youth activists in Kudus; people’s rejection of the establishment of a Buddhist temple in Salatiga and the halting of a Sapto Darmo workshop in Rembang and of a Ngesti Ksampurnan workshop in Sumowono, Semarang. Other cases included Sedulur Sikep (Samin) members being forced to study Islam in Kudus and an attack by a mass organization against a community group in Surakarta. In the courts, the leader of the Amanat Keagungan Ilahi in Klaten was convicted of religious defamation, while Ahmadiyah members were forced to sign an agreement to freeze their religious activities in Tawangmangu. “It’s difficult to label any municipality or regency in Central Java as being tolerant or intolerant because, upon examination, each region has shown examples of both,” Tedi said. In Kudus, for example, Samin members were forced to study Islam but, at the same time, the request by Samin members to leave the religious column on their ID cards blank was approved by the local administration. Chairman of the Central Java Interfaith Forum (FKUB), Abu Hapsin, identified Surakarta and its environs as the most prone region to both internal and interfaith conflicts, mostly due to absolute and textual understandings of religion. “Apart from the Ngruki Islamic boarding school, the MMI [Indonesian Mujahidin Council] and the FPI [Islam Defenders Front], there are 25 other religious groups that are strict in their understanding of Islam,” said Abu, referring to three of the country’s hard-line groups. Conflicts, according to Abu, normally emerged when the administration adopted the interests of the majority and ignored those of the minority. “If only the majority is considered, what if the decision is not fair to the minority?” he asked. Syaiful Uyun, an Ahmadiyah preacher from eastern Central Java, said his group was still being pressured by a number of parties, including the local community, police and subdistrict administration, to cease its religious activities. The latest incidents, according to Syaiful, had occurred in Tawangmangu, Kendal and Temanggung. “Our chairman was asked to sign a statement saying we would not continue our activities,” he said. Syaiful, however, insisted that their religious activities meant praying, not preaching. Syaiful added that the Ahmadis had been lobbying local administrations in the respective regions to seek a solution. “We respect the joint ministerial decree, although it is very hard for us. So, we ask other parties to show respect by not suppressing us,” he said. According to Syaiful, Central Java is home to some 15,000 members of Ahmadiyah.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/16/amid-growing-religious-harmony-friction-still-occurs.html,,2012

"Thu, June 21 2012",Text your say: Criminalizing atheism,"Your comments on the Sijunjung District Court in West Sumatra whichsentenced on Thursday a man to two-and-a-half years for blasphemy andpublicly declaring himself as an atheist : Serving 2.5 years in jail for declaring oneself an atheist is outrageous to me. We know as a civilized society what we believe can’t be enforced by anything; it is totally the free will of man. Levi Jakarta You must exercise your freedom of speech responsibly. I mean, there are several matters about which you can’t easily speak your mind, especially in public, such as God, race and religion. It means you have to refrain from offending other people. Bagas Windianto Religious intolerance by a few hard-line Islamist groups has spilled over to the law enforcement and legal authorities. It appears that only the “accepted” practiced form of Islam sets the norm and people with other religious beliefs, or no beliefs, are persecuted either formally or informally. The last, of course, refers mainly to the FPI whose members do as they please and appear to do the biding of others. The Constitution and the law of the land are set aside to please the FPI and other hard-line groups. The question is why? Is the FPI politically so strong and influential that they are allowed to act outside the law with impunity? Are they indeed proxies for the TNI to stage another bloody event that sets our country back for a decade or more? Perhaps we will find out sooner rather than later! Henry Manoe Sure sign of emotional insecurity. Colin Anderson Surely the judge’s argument is easily broken; I’m surprised that Aan’s lawyer didn’t say something about it. The judge is right that Aan must have intentionally spread his messages; but that doesn’t automatically mean that he intentionally spread hatred, as the judge would like to put it. Article 28 is about intentionally spreading hatred. You guys should also be more careful in reading. Aan was not sentenced for being an atheist. He was sentenced for defamatory postings he made in Facebook, which the judge tried to nail through Article 28. Of course it is lame; but a good lawyer should be able to get him out. So if any of you are a lawyer and are seeking your chance to leapfrog your career, this is your golden opportunity. Wishnu Prasetya I do not believe in God and I am very glad that I do not live in Indonesia. Nel I was not aware that we no longer have the freedom to choose our religious beliefs. Mace The picture of Alexander Aan behind bars for declaring himself an atheist (The Jakarta Post June 19, 2012) is to be compared, I would say, with the disrespect for other religions and beliefs: the Shiites, the Ahmadis, the Yasmin Church followers and many more. Is it really a crime to declare oneself as being different from others? Whatever is wrong with us? This is truly embarrassing and certainly worrisome. Who is better; the person who “honestly tells himself that he doesn’t believe You ever existed” or the guy who thinks he has the right to punish the aforesaid individual for not believing You ever existed? Well, that is happening in my country; embarrassing as it may be. Forgive us as we are still growing and learning.

"Sat, June 23 2012",Gender equality bill faces more battles,"The House of Representatives’ deliberations on the gender equality bill have turned into a battleground between feminists and conservative groups in society, according to one observer. Any Sutjipto, a gender expert from the University of Indonesia (UI), said that lawmakers have been deliberating the bill with religious conservatives, which would likely stall its progress and make it unlikely that the House would endorse the bill by the end of the year, as scheduled. “From the beginning, women’s groups have had different opinions on whether they need the bill in the first place. These groups have different ideologies,” Any told The Jakarta Post. Groups that supported the bill would likely provide more access to women who have yet to give their support for the bill, Any said. Those who have thrown their support behind the bill have said that its passage was imperative, even though the government previously ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1984. Critics have said that there was no legally binding regulation that could be used to improve the condition of women. Even among groups that supported, it has been difficult to ask them to sit together and make an agreement. “Among the groups that support the bill, such as the Women’s Empowerment and Child Protection Ministry, the Women’s Caucus and Komnas Perempuan [the National Commission on the Protection from Violence Against Women], it is hard to make them sit together and talk about the substance of the bill as they have no agreement yet as to how the bill should take shape,” Ani said. To complicate matters, progressive groups now must deal with more united conservative groups. “Groups like the FPI [Islam Defenders Front] and the FBR [Betawi Brotherhood Forum] distribute leaflets or give sermons saying that the bill contradicts religion and family values,” she said. The Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), Muhammadiyah women’s organization Aisyiah, the Indonesian Women’s Congress (Kowani), and the Assembly of Indonesian Muslim Young Intellectuals (MIUMI) are among the groups that have openly stated opposition to the bill. Some activists said that articles in the bill would lead to the legalization of same-sex marriage or would encourage women to favor professional opportunities over their household roles. Mariana Amiruddin of Women’s Journal said that conservative groups were paranoid about the perceived intrusion of “western” values. “It’s a pity that the basic ideas of the bill are left untouched. Most groups that came to the hearing at the House were concerned only about the title of the bill and the term ‘gender’ without trying to understand the basic issues” she said. Ninik Rahayu, deputy chairperson of Komnas Perempuan, said that the commission would support the bill if it provided protection for women from both physical and structural violence.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/23/gender-equality-bill-faces-more-battles.html,,2012

Trio Macan were “able to be polite and meet the conditions of the FPI”, Radio Cosmo director and concert organizer, Mufti Muchtiar, said. “But the FPI asked them to sign an agreement in front of Bandung’s mayor, police chief, the Indonesian Ulema Council as well as the Bandung Military Command chief, which I think is difficult,” Mufti said in Bandung on Friday. About 30 members of the hard-line group protested the performance in front of Radio Cosmo Bandung on Wednesday, threatening to take “any measures” necessary unless the singers canceled their show or wore veils and did not dance suggestively. The FPI also insisted that the dangdut singers perform “religious” songs. During the rally, the FPI likened Trio Macan to devils and said that the performance might lead to rape and sexual assaults.

Some 30 FPI members staged a protest on Wednesday in front of a dangdut radio station in Bandung, which will host the Saturday concert where Trio Macan is scheduled to play. The protesters also demanded that Trio Macan not perform any “erotic dance” and should instead sing religious songs if they perform in the city.

"Tue, June 26 2012","FPI, MUI are blasé on Koran corruption","Nasaruddin Umar: (JP) Representatives of two of the nation’s most prominent Muslim groups are none too outraged about the allegations of corruption surrounding the procurement of Korans by the Religious Affairs Ministry. The chairman of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), Ma’aruf Amin, said on Monday that the graft case should be treated like any other. “Koran or not, people will still commit crimes if they have the intention. This is a legal matter. Those guilty of the crime should be punished accordingly.” Ma’aruf’s assessment of the scandal differed from that offered by Deputy Religious Affairs Minister Nasaruddin Umar, who said that the sins of those implicated in the scandal would multiply. Nasaruddin, who was the ministry’s Islamic education chief at the time of the suspect procurement, said that he found no indications of irregularities in the project, which he said involved Rp 3 billion (US$318,000) of state funds in 2010 and Rp 5 billion in 2011. The Indonesian Budget Center, however, has said that the state might have suffered up to Rp 54.4 billion in losses due to corruption surrounding the procurement. The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) has interrogated several officials at the ministry about the allegations. Separately, a spokesman for the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) said that the graft scandal involved government officials stealing money and was no different from other such cases. “We have to put this in perspective. What’s been stolen is the project’s money, and not the Korans. It is basically just another corruption case, FPI spokesman Munarman said. “Where there’s a project, there’s money. People stole some of it.” Munarman said that there was no other way but to investigate the case thoroughly. The response of the MUI and FPI, which stands in sharp contrast to the religious decrees and threats issued by the groups when they perceived a slight, was casual when compared to that of Din Syamsuddin. On Sunday, Din, the chairman of Muhammadiyah, the nation’s second-largest Muslim social and political group, called the scandal odious and shameful to the nation’s Muslims. “I was surprised when first hearing [the allegations]. It needs to be clarified, but I wish it was not true,” Din said. “If it is true that there is this scandal at the Religious Affairs Ministry, I don’t know how it will be able to manage religious affairs in the country,” he said. Separately, the deputy chairman of House Commission VIII overseeing religious affairs, Jazuli Juwaini, called on the ministry to be transparent on the investigation. “We need to keep encouraging the ministry to be more honest, trustworthy and transparent. There needs to be severe punishment for any violations,“ Jazuli said. (aml)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/26/fpi-mui-are-blas-koran-corruption.html,,2012
"Wed, June 27 2012",Comment: Trio Macan cancels Bandung show,"May 22, Online Dangdut group Trio Macan followed US pop sensation Lady Gaga in yielding to hard line group Islam Defenders Front (FPI), deciding to cancel its planned performance rather than compromising with the group’s demands. The FPI Bandung chapter demanded Trio Macan, who planned to perform at a dangdut concert hosted by a local radio in Bandung, West Java, tone down their act by wearing headscarves and sing religious songs, citing moral reasons. Your comments: I watched a number of the Trio’s shows and while they can be a little raunchy, they have the right to be on stage. You have the right to express your opinion and you have the right to not watch the show and you and your wives have the right to leave. However, you do not have the right to take action; you do not have the right to interfere in anybody else’s rights, regardless of how “polite” you were. You do not have the right to stomp on their rights. Where do you draw the line between “polite” action and “threats and violence”? I strongly suggest that this is the time for you to reevaluate the definition of terrorism and intolerance. Democracy must include freedom and liberty for all humans, not just the majority. Brien I strongly suggest that those who champion the protection and promotion of human rights, including freedom of expression, to first watch this Trio Macan singers performance before they make any comments. As a pre-warning though, I wish to inform you that there has been a case in which this group was asked to immediately stop performing, not by the FPI, but by our wives and ladies, who watched their shows. The movements of the dances this group were performing were sexually explicit, portraying how you should wildly make love with your partner. It was really disgusting. We finally politely halted the show and asked these girls to leave the scene. I was so happy we did that; no regrets whatsoever.

"Fri, July 6 2012",Candidates vow to keep city’s diversity,"The candidates: A banner featuring the pictures of gubernatorial candidates is displayed along the sidewalk on Jl. Lenteng Agung, South Jakarta, on Thursday. Jakartans will vote on July 11. (JP/P.J. Leo) Jakarta has always been home to people of various ethnic and religious backgrounds. It is thus requisite that its next governor is a person who is committed to making the city comfortable for everyone, regardless of ethnicity or religion. Though it has seen no major incidents of religious violence in the past few years, some observers are wary that the capital is becoming less tolerant and inclusive. The city recently grabbed international media attention after the Jakarta-chapter of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) forced American singer Lady Gaga to cancel her much-awaited gig in the capital. The group threatened to disperse the concert should the organizer press ahead with their plan for Gaga’s concert. The Jakarta Police refused to issue a permit for the concert, citing security concerns. Local fans of the controversial singer, whose songs have been considered as “immoral” by the FPI and other hard-line groups, decried the fact that the authorities had bowed to hard-liner pressures. The six men running in the July 11 election have vowed to keep Jakarta’s diversity and to protect its minority groups. Alex Noerdin and his running mate, Nono Sampono, said that the campaign aimed to create a “harmonious life” in Jakarta. “Every leader has a duty to protect minority groups from repressing majority because the law guarantees the freedom and human rights of all citizens,” Nono said, adding the caveat that everyone was allowed to express themselves as long as they conformed to existing norms. Having been governor of Jakarta for five years, Fauzi Bowo, who is a Betawi descendant, claims that he understands the city’s pluralism, saying that it is an old characteristic of Jakarta. “When the city was established, we already had Tionghoa, Hindi and Arab residents who settled in Sunda Kelapa. I ensure you that it won’t change,” he said. Fauzi, however, was recently criticized for attacking his contenders as out-of-towners who could “ruin” Jakarta instead of developing it. He was refering to Surakarta Mayor Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and Alex, the active governor of West Sumatra. Jokowi and his running mate, Bangka Belitung native Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, have been more assertive in showing their commitment to pluralism. Ahok, who is ethnically Chinese and is a Christian, recently said that if he had to choose between the Constitution and the Bible, he would obey the Constitution. His statement drew both criticism and praise from the public. Jokowi and Ahok, whose checkered shirts have become icons in this year’s campaign, said that the shirts symbolized pluralism in Jakarta. “Pluralism is symbolized by these checkered shirts — the pattern creates a strong and beautiful shirt. That is the kind of pluralism that we want in Jakarta — strengthening, not weakening,” said Jokowi. Meanwhile, independent candidate Hendardji Soepandji said that Jakarta did not belong to a single group and that all people, regardless of their backgrounds, had the same rights to a proper livelihood and a significant role the city. Hidayat Nur Wahid, who is backed by the Islamic-based Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), said that he would not issue sharia bylaws in the city. “Pluralism is a daily meal for the PKS. I have been a coordinator of the Peaceful Indonesia Forum, involving many religious leaders.” Faisal Basri, another independent, embeds pluralism in his vision by forwarding a vision of Jakarta as a civilized city where everyone can express their aspirations on an equal footing. Faisal said that freedom of expression was a fundamental right for citizens. A researcher from human rights watchdog Setara Institute, Bonar Tigor Naispopos, said the challenge for the next governor was to ensure that freedom of expression was upheld. He added that compared to other areas, Jakartans are more accustomed to differences and that the city was home to many kinds of people. Today’s Jakarta is a demographic melting pot, with ethnic Betawi residents comprising only 27.65 percent of city’s nearly 10 million residents. According to the Central Statistics Agency (BPS), 35.16 percent of residents are Javanese and 15.27 percent are Sundanese.

"Sun, July 8 2012",A sense of connectivity,"Jakarta residents use their mobile phones in front of an office in Kuningan area, Central Jakarta, on Friday. (JP/Jerry Adiguna) Social media brings to the country a sense of connectivity — to be a part of something bigger than oneself and a feeling that together, people can actually make a difference. The pages of Twitter and Facebook are filled with numerous organizations with different goals — the goals that they aim to achieve from the ground up. “With digital technology, it is like social relationships are now on steroids” said Enda Nasution, a popular blogger who set up the website salingsilang.com. “Indonesians have a different concept of friendship; most will have over 2,000 friends on their Facebook accounts. If someone asks to be your friend, it is considered an honor.” Enda, a strong advocate for social media, explains its potential to benefit the nation at many levels, from education to commerce and business. Facilitating the creation and organization of pressure groups, he believes that the true power of social media is its ability to spread awareness and push for change — a power that recently came out in full force following the cancellation of Lady Gaga’s concert in Jakarta. With hundreds of Lady Gaga’s “little monsters” tuned logging onto Twitter and Facebook to question the government and defend their freedom of expression, the flame of social media in Jakarta was ignited. At the time, the official Twitter account for Indonesian Gaga fans, @LadyGagaINDO was brought alive with passionate tweets defending their idol and was also used to coordinate a flash-mob event on June 3 in protest of the government’s apparent surrender to the demands of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). The frustration behind this online petition bounced right off the web pages of change.org, making it difficult to ignore the anti-FPI appeals. Founded by 31-year-old Ben Rattray, change.org gives people the power to get behind a cause with a simple click. In Indonesia, it has been used to appeal to international organizations, including the United Nations, to have the FPI banished from the country if the Indonesian government was unable to do so within one year. In this way, social media is not only used to reach out to those who seek to better their lives, but also those whose lives are at risk. Bernard Wahyumandiri, edutainment coordinator of Yayasan Aids, said that Twitter and Facebook had been crucial in forwarding their campaign. “These sites help us to keep on reminding people about HIV in Indonesia, and more importantly, we can reach out to people who may need our information,” he said. The organization’s Twitter account, @YAIDS, the following of which is growing by around 100-300 people a month, acts as an online safety net, welcoming those who need a support network. It is not simply these websites’ capacity to reach out to individuals that give them such power, but also the trendy images they carry and the demographics of their users, particularly young adults. When one thinks of a teenager’s interests, gardening is not something that immediately comes to mind. This is something that Sigit Kusamawijaya, one of the initiators of Indonesia Berkebun, has sought to change. “Teenagers may not like the idea of gardening, that is why we use Twitter to make it more fun. We can make jokes about it and we can encourage followers to post pictures of what they have planted, which we can then resend,” he said. The organization, which has the Twitter account @IDBerkebun, uses social-media platforms to encourage sustainable development in cities around Indonesia. Hoping for a greener future for Indonesia, the community is “based on urban apprehension, such as environmental destruction and the lack of public green spaces and also impending food shortages in the future”. They are proud winners of the Google Inc. award in the Web-Heroes category as they used Twitter to rapidly attract a strong following of 1,000 followers in their first month after being launched in Oct. 2010. Sigit’s happiness at the thought of a growing environmental conscience is contagious, as “the spirit has already spread to more than 20 cities in Indonesia via Twitter”. So, a simple click may not be enough to change the world, but a power lies at our fingertips that must not go to waste. Like a virtual megaphone, social media has amplified voices that were previously unheard — voices from all corners of Indonesian life. While there may be challenges to overcome, we are embarking on a journey in search of a better future with the aid of digital platforms. A journey that, according to Enda, “we will all have to be involved in”. — The writer is an intern at The Jakarta Post",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/07/08/a-sense-connectivity.html,,2012

(JP/R.Berto Wedhatama) The Jakarta Police said on Monday that they would forbid mass organizations from conducting raids on the city’s nightlife and entertainment venues during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadhan, as the organizations have no right to do so. “Only the police have the right to raid nightclubs that remain open during Ramadhan. No mass organization has such rights,” police spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto told reporters. The city’s culture and tourism agency said earlier this month that it would ban nightlife and entertainment venues from operating during Ramadhan, starting from the eve of the fasting month until one day after Idul Fitri. Such banned spots include nightclubs, spas, saunas, massage parlors, arcade game centers and bars (either stand-alone bars or those located within other establishments). In recent years, Greater Jakarta has seen numerous instances of mass organizations holding raids on nightlife venues throughout the area. On Sunday, the Depok branch of hard-liner group the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) held a cavalcade around the city, demanding the Depok Police close down all nightlife venues in the city throughout Ramadhan. “If [the Depok administration] does not issue a decision to close down nightlife venues within three days from the start of the fasting month, then we will take it upon ourselves to act,” Depok FPI chairman Habib Idrus Al Gadhri said, as quoted by the Antara news agency. Rikwanto said that police would manage any nightlife venues that remained open during Ramadhan and there would be no need for the mass organizations to “join in”. “If the organizations insist on conducting raids and disturbing the peace, we will not hesitate to act firmly against them,” Rikwanto said. The fasting month is expected to start on July 19 or 20 this year, with the Idul Fitri holiday falling on Aug. 19 and 20. Rikwanto said that several forms of entertainment venues would be permitted to remain open, although with some restrictions in place during Ramadhan. Karaoke and live music lounges, for example, would only be allowed to operate from 8:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. every day during the month. Pool halls located within other establishments face the same restrictions, while stand-alone pool halls can operate from 10 a.m. until midnight. However, all entertainment venues will have to close for the entire day for the day before and on the start of Ramadhan, on the 17th day of Ramadhan or Nuzulul Qur’an, on the eve of Idul Fitri, on the two days of Idul Fitri and the day after Idul Fitri. Business owners deemed to be in violation of the regulation could face up to three months in prison or a maximum fine of Rp 5 million (US$530). The establishments can also be sealed off or have their permits revoked due to the violation. Regulations for nightlife spots during Ramadhan Must be closed all month long • Nightclubs • Spas, saunas and massage parlors • Arcade game centers • Bars (either stand-alone bars or those located within other establishments) May be open, with some restrictions • Karaoke and live music lounges, 8:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. daily Pool halls • Located within other spots: adhering to the respective spots’ restrictions • Stand-alone pool halls: 10 a.m. until midnight Source: The Jakarta Post",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/07/17/police-ban-private-raids-during-ramadhan.html,,2012

Muslim I would like to remind all the netters here, let us be more objective in passing judgment on the FPI; that the actions of the FPI may not be due merely to the FPI wanting to be “village” superheroes but rather the nation’s chronic polemic against public confidence in law enforcement.

"Wed, July 18 2012",Boy gets 40 months for killing FPI member,"The Bogor District Court has convicted a 17-year-old boy of killing a member of the local branch of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) in May. The boy, Bogor resident Ival Reza Yulian Mahendra, was sentenced to three-and-half years’ imprisonment for fatal assault under Article 351 of the Criminal Code (KUHP), presiding judge Sakilah said on Tuesday while reading the verdict. The sentence was lighter than the seven years demanded by prosecutors, according to Sakilah, as Ival was a boy with no prior convictions who had confessed to the crime. Ival’s lawyer, Partin Yulitha Dewi Daulay, said he accepted the verdict. “Ival is still a juvenile. That’s why his sentence was only half of that of an adult,” Partin said, adding that the autopsy report on the slain FPI member was “not conclusive on the cause of death.” Ival, a high school student, killed Muslim Mustofa, 40, the secretary of FPI’s branch in Cipayung in Bogor, West Java, on May 6 at around 4 a.m., prosecutors said. Ival was reportedly on his way to watch an illegal motorbike race with friends. The plans were called off when the group found local residents brawling with the would-be drag racers. Several cars then stopped, disgorging FPI members who joined the melee in full force, ostensibly to disperse the brawl. The appearance of the self-styled vigilantes only exacerbated the violence. In the ensuing chaos, Ival struck an FPI member in the back with a sickle, killing him. FPI members present on Tuesday were visibly upset with the court’s decision. “We do not accept the judge’s verdict. How come the sentence for a murderer is the same as that of a chicken thief?” Habib Ali Alkaf, a local FPI leader, said after the trial. “We want a heavy sentence, no matter that the defendant is a boy. He has committed murder.” Hundreds of FPI members from local branches were on hand for the verdict, inside and outside the courtroom. Some of the men beat drums while repeatedly shouting “God is Great!” The proceedings, however, ended without incident, as about 400 officers from the Mobile Brigade special operations units of the Bogor and West Java Police were on hand. FPI members came out in force on July 9, after judges accelerated the start by 90 minutes of the trial session where prosecutors made their three-and-a-half year sentence demand for Ival. Members assembled at the court at 11 a.m. to find that the hearing had just finished. The group protested in front of the courthouse, demanding an explanation behind the early start. When their protest went unnoticed, the group moved to Bogor Prosecutor’s Office, where they were eventually received by the city’s head prosecutor, A. Ghazali. The FPI is a hard-line group infamous for its use of threats and violence to stop what it deems as “sinful” activity. Although the Jakarta Police recently announced it would not tolerate such raids during the Ramadhan fasting month, authorities have been loath to crack down on the FPI’s extra-judicial vigilantism. Officials, for example, refused to allow Lady Gaga to perform in Jakarta in May after the FPI said the singer promoted “Satanic teachings”, threatening to stop her from leaving Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Banten. Also in May, men affiliated with the hard-line group attacked Canadian Muslim writer Irshad Manji in Jakarta and Yogyakarta for “defaming” Islam in her book on sexuality and Islam. About 30 members of the FPI also forced a radio station in Bandung, West Java, to cancel a planned concert by Trio Macan in June. Although the dangdut singers agreed to tone down their performance, the promoter cancelled the gig after the FPI insisted that the group sign an agreement in front of Bandung’s mayor and police chief, among a host of officials.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/07/18/boy-gets-40-months-killing-fpi-member.html,,2012
"Thu, July 19 2012",Comment: FPI not to conduct raids during Ramadhan,"July 16, Online The hard-line group, Islam Defenders Front (FPI), promised not to conduct any raids during the Ramadhan fasting month and let police carry out the task, secretary-general Sobri Lubis said on Monday. FPI’s commitment was made after National Police Chief, Gen. Timur Pradopo, banned mass organizations from conducting any raids during the Islamic fasting month, set to begin Friday. Your comments: Banning nightlife is, first, illegal, as it is discriminatory against other beliefs, in favor of the dominant religion. Second, it is simply unethical and certainly unfair toward other citizens in the nation, whether they be Muslim or not. This is forcing an extremist point of view onto the real majority. Third, it goes against the whole true concept of Ramadhan, which is to try to be holy in the face of the world’s temptations. However, it is time for the entertainment industry to band together and just refuse to comply with laws that should not exist. If the police were forced to try to arrest 15,000 bar owners, then maybe they might be forced to abandon their cowardly obedience to the religious extremists.

"Thu, July 26 2012",Issues of the day: Ramadhan and the problem of Islamic law,"July 20, p. 6 Ramadhan has arrived, but as has happened in the past, the period is marked with public anxiety about acts of violence by radical groups who use force to demand that people respect the fasting month in the name of sharia or Islamic law. They demand the closure of restaurants during the day and of nightclubs and other entertainment spots when Muslims gather for Tarawih prayer in the evening. Such acts of violence frequently receive support from local governments through the enactment of regional ordinances identical to the wishes of radical groups. The question is whether such actions are necessary and legitimate under our legal system. First, the so-called Islamic law. In the sense of legal theory, this is a misleading concept embedded in the common sense of our people. “Islamic Law”, according to legal science, refers to a particular law which derives from Islamic values. So, because it is a (particular kind of) law, it must be in line with the general concept of law. (By Joeni Arianto Kurniawan) Your comments: In Indonesia, a country with Muslim majority, it is fair and clearly acceptable for Muslims to have a higher bargaining position. This higher bargaining position ought to be reflected by a more significant Muslim collective right, such as the Muslim right to have a social environment free from various social issues against Islamic values, like pornography, gambling and drugs. It is also a fair request, as a majority, if Muslims are asking and demanding their collective rights from government, such as the adoption of Islamic values (Sharia) which are universal and not against other religions, into the country’s social and legal regulations. The better these regulations and their enforcement, the lesser the role of groups like the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), as we try to fight for the improvement and implementation of social laws and regulations as religious citizens of this beloved country. Ahmed Lats It is not acceptable to have different sets of laws enforced upon society. Therefore, the government must in fact declare that the state only recognizes its own law, in all public matters. Organizations such as the FPI, by imposing and enforcing their own demands and standards on society, have spread terror in public. Their acts should be classified as acts of terror, and any such attempts by the FPI should be considered as terrorist activity. The majority did not say that they wanted Islamic law. Before any Islamic law is to be imposed, it must pass through the constitutional process. There are many other interests in this country, and this country is established on the principle of pluralism. Faustus Please tell me what rights restaurants and bars infringe by opening during Ramadhan? Nobody forces you to enter the restaurants or bars. If you are fasting, then perhaps you shouldn’t walk into a bar. Hansard Widrick Unfortunately, there seems to be quite a large number of people who believe their religion is above all others and place their own desires and values above the rights of others. As long as the government does not act against this situation, there is no hope for true harmony in Indonesia. Unfortunately, things are going backward, not forward. I doubt that many in power have the intelligence or the integrity to enforce such equality of beliefs. Sam Spade We as human beings are religious. We must act and be smart in making decisions. Indonesia is a country that has five religions professed by their respective inhabitants. We should respect each others’ faiths.

"Fri, July 27 2012",Issues of the day: SBY questions UN’s efforts,"July 20, p 1 President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono questioned the effectiveness of the UN’s efforts in stopping the 16-month conflict in Syria, which has claimed thousands of lives, and called on the world body to send peacemaking troops to get the situation under control. On Thursday, Russia and China for the third time vetoed a Western-backed UN Security Council resolution that threatened Syrian authorities with sanctions if they did not stop using heavy weapons against the uprising and withdraw troops from towns and cities. The vetoed resolution, which would have extended a UN observer mission to Syria for 45 days, received 11 votes in favor, with two abstentions. The 15-member council still has time to negotiate another resolution on the fate of the unarmed mission before its initial 90-day mandate expires at midnight (0400 GMT) on Friday, Reuters reported. Your comments: Perhaps SBY could lead by example and put pressure on China and Russia, as the problem lies with those two countries. He could also propose that ASEAN do likewise. Walter John Gomm The civil war in Syria, started when the people asked for freedom and justice. The regime headed by Assad, the dictator son of a dictator father, won’t listen to what people want. He, his generals, close family and friends prefer to keep their privileges despite the mass demonstrations. No wonder the regime is supported by China and Russia, two countries which have never respected democracy and freedom of speech. The Arab world asked the regime to give the people of Syria their freedom, but Assad & Co won’t listen at all. Today, the world can see UN is helpless. Politicians talk while hundreds of Syrians die every day. The victims have reached tens of thousands, dead, massacred or fled from their homeland. Widya Utama SBY send your troops to ports throughout Indonesia and stop this business of people smuggling. There are hundreds of people dying from inaction by the Indonesian government which allows government officials and smugglers to continue mass murder of these illegal migrants sent in leaky boats to Australia. Which one is worse, mass murder of illegal migrants in Indonesian waters or the killings in Syria? SBY, do a good deed for Ramadhan and stop the poor illegal migrants from dying. Baz Act Let SBY first stop the actions of the mass organizations (like FPI etc.) against the minority groups before he comments on other countries or institutions.

"Fri, January 11 2013",FPI member faces 5 years in jail,"Prosecutors at the Bandung District Court on Thursday sought a five-and-a-half years jail sentence for Islam Defenders Front (FPI) member, Asep “Utep” Abdurahman, for allegedly damaging the Ahmadiyah An-Nasir mosque in Bandung, West Java, on the eve of Idul Fitri (the Islamic Day of Sacrifice). Prosecutor Agus Mujoko said that Utep was charged under Article 170 of the Criminal Code on assault, as well as Article 335 on offensive behavior. Dozens of FPI members attended the trial, presided over by judge Sinung Hermawan. On October 25, members of the FPI allegedly raided An-Nasir mosque, damaging the place of worship and preventing Ahmadis from celebrating Idul Adha. The FPI members took three Ahmadis to the Astana Anyar Police precinct and tried to force them to sign an agreement not to hold Idul Adha prayers or slaughter sacrificial animals on the next day. The Ahmadis’ rejection of the agreement reportedly enraged Utep and led him to break the mosque’s windows. Utep himself denied the allegations, saying that he did not smash the windows but he admitted to kicking the gate. Utep’s lawyer, Firman Turmantara, said Utep and some FPI members came to the mosque in accordance with the implementation of the 2011 Governor Regulation No. 12 on the banning of Ahmadiyah activities in West Java. “The activities [performed by the Ahmadis ahead of Idul Adha] are strictly against the regulation,” said Firman.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/01/11/fpi-member-faces-5-years-jail.html,,2013
"Sun, January 13 2013",The week in review: Ahok and the clerics,"In a meeting with Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnana on Jan. 10, the Jakarta branch of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) asked city authorities to help to reinforce its edict against holding mass prayers in public spaces, including on main streets in Jakarta. Ahok agreed to help the clerics. Mass prayers, many of them organized by clerics claiming to be descendants of Prophet Muhammad, often cause massive traffic jams, and the police do almost nothing to stop the activities despite mounting public complaints. Have the MUI leaders forgotten their edict against voting for a Christian, which Ahok is, in July last year, just before the gubernatorial election? Or have they finally accepted the principle of vox populi vox Dei (the voice of people is the voice of God)? Did the leaders of the state-recognized council decide to “annul” their decision that it was haram (forbidden under Islam) for Muslims to vote for a non-Muslim candidate in last year’s gubernatorial election — because the majority of Jakartans chose Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and Ahok as their governor and vice governor, respectively, until 2017? The MUI reportedly issued an edict on July 23 last year on “the obligation [for Muslims] to vote for Muslim candidates for governor and vice governor, and it is haram to vote for an infidel,” bisnis.com quoted the MUI as declaring. The clerics were clearly in favor of then incumbent governor Fauzi Bowo. Not long after Jokowi and Ahok’s victory, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) demanded the city council ensure that Ahok would not deal with anything related to Islam, such as religious organizations. The FPI said that Ahok could only deal with religious matters if he converted to Islam. It is tempting to question the motive of the clerics in making such a demand of Ahok. From a positive point of view, the clerics have fully accepted the leadership of Governor Jokowi and Ahok, and Ahok now has an opportunity to demonstrate his ability to talk to mass prayer organizers, because it is crystal clear that even the police do little to enforce bylaws on public order. But we also cannot blame people who may think — rightly or wrongly — that the MUI leaders are setting a trap for Ahok because there is little chance that he can settle such a sensitive issue when the MUI leaders themselves are reluctant to try. Meanwhile, the South Tangerang Health Agency has taken blood samples from 187 street workers in an effort to monitor the spread of HIV in the new municipality. The agency’s M. Rusmin indicated  on Thursday that the agency had  raided sex workers and apparently forced them to undergo blood tests. “If tested positive for HIV, we must place them in a quarantine center for medication and education on HIV/AIDS,” said Rusmin. In the past several years, the central and local governments have faced pressure to close official prostitution centers by public figures, who said it was sinful and against any religious teachings. However, it created another problem, because it is much more difficult for health officials to monitor sex workers’ health when they work on the streets or backstreet brothels. *** The General Elections Commission (KPU) announced on Tuesday that only one new political party, the National Democrat (NasDem) Party, had passed verification for the next election. The new party will join nine other political parties, which have seats in the legislature, in the 2014 election. Thirty-four political parties registered for the election, meaning that 24 parties failed to meet the legal requirements. The failed parties accused the nine parties — including Golkar,  Democratic Party (PD), the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP) and the Prosperous Justice Party —  of intentionally blocking new players from the election by creating a restrictive Election Law. The number of participants in the 2014 election will be fewer than those in the three previous free-and-democratic  elections. In 1999, or one year after the fall of Soeharto from his 32-year rule, 48 parties contested the legislative election.  In 2004, the number was only 24. The 2009 election was contested by 38 parties. Meanwhile, following public outcry and pressure from the central government,  Lhokseumawe Mayor Suaidi Yahya has been forced to delay, at least for a while, his decision to ban women from straddling motorcycles. The mayor of Aceh’s second-largest city argued that the position was improper for women according to Islam. Instead, women should ride sidesaddle according to him, with both legs on one side of the motorcycle. The mayor also insisted that the planned policy would strengthen women’s dignity in the city. Aceh is the only province allowed to implement sharia in Indonesia. It was the result of a peace agreement between the central government and the Free Aceh Movement several years ago. *** On Friday, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono appointed flamboyant legislator Roy Suryo Notodiprojo as the new youth and sports minister, replacing Andi Mallarangeng.

"Thu, January 31 2013",Suryadharma gets cozy with Islam Defenders Front,"In what could be seen as an effort to squeeze votes out of devout Muslims, the Islamist United Development Party (PPP) has declared itself ready to strike a deal with the vigilante organization the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) even going so far as nominating Munarman, the organization’s outspoken figurehead, as a legislative candidate. Religious Affairs Minister and PPP chairman Suryadharma Ali believes that Munarman is well-qualified for the job. “He comes highly recommended. He is knowledgeable and a lawyer — a perfect fit to be active in politics.” If Munarman is nominated at all, it will likely be to represent South Sumatra, his home province. Suryadharma has no problems with the image of FPI, well known for the promotion of violence. and destruction of preperty. “Let’s say the FPI is a radical organization, should we stay away from them or embrace them? I think we should embrace them,” Suryadharma said, suggesting that the FPI could make a positive contribution to the country’s politics if they were welcomed into the system. In response to Suryadharma’s offer, Munarman said he had not yet made any decision. “I haven’t made any decision yet. I need to conduct an Istikharah prayer first before I accept the honor. But this is still an offer from Pak Suryadharma Ali and I thank him for that,” Munarman told kompas.com. Other than Munarman, the PPP is expected to enlist a family member of Panji Gumilang, suspected leader of the Indonesia Islamic Movement (NII). “God willing we will nominate Panji Gumilang’s son. We just need to confirm with him,” Suryadharma said. Snuggling up to the FPI and the NII could be seen as part of a strategy by the PPP to remain an exclusively Islamic party going against the trend among Muslim-based parties to go secular. PPP executives have declared that the party would only nominate Muslims to run in 2014. Faced with the prediction that Muslim-based parties will lose significant votes to secular parties, some Islamist parties have begun to woo secular voters. The National Mandate Party (PAN) is planning to be less visually Islamic and more inclusive during campaigns. The National Awakening Party (PKB) plans to increase the number of non-Muslim members to develop the party’s inclusivity. Suryadharma himself is no stranger to controversy as a minister. In September last year, responding to a clash between the Sunni majority in Sampang, Madura and the Shia minority, Suryadharma said that the conversion of the latter would be the best way to prevent violent outbreaks between the two sects.

"Mon, February 4 2013",PPP continues reaching out to fringe groups,"The Islamic United Development Party (PPP) has continued to make overtures to a number of fringe groups in the country in an effort to shore up support from traditional Muslims. On Sunday, party chairman Suryadharma Ali, who is also the religious affairs minister, announced that his party was open to members of the Indonesian Islamic Propa-gation Institute (LDII) and Al-Zaytun boarding school, two institutions that have been seen by many as part of a radical movement; the outlawed Indonesia Islamic State (NII). “I know this is controversial,” Suryadharma said in his speech during the commemoration of the party’s 40th anniversary in Bandung, West Java. Suryadharma went on to say that the PPP was ready to embrace members of other Muslim organizations viewed by the public as “firebrand” organizations. “I don’t have to say these groups are extremist. But then, what should we do [about these groups]? Should we just let them be or embrace them?” he said. Suryadharma said that the PPP was ready to reach out to the groups and bring them to the true version of Islam, as promoted by the party. “We have to embrace them first to build communication,” he said, adding that Islam was not a religion of terror but of peace. Last week, Suryadharma made a similar gesture to the vigilante group the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). The PPP even went so far as to nominate Munarman, the FPI’s outspoken figurehead, as a legislative candidate. Suryadharma Ali believes that Munarman is well-qualified for the job. “He comes highly recommended. He is knowledgeable and a lawyer — a perfect fit to be active in politics,” he said.

"Mon, February 4 2013",Ahmad Tohari: Remembering 1965 and speaking out,"Linawarti Sidarto In his soothing voice, writer Ahmad Tohari sliced open two of Indonesia’s most sensitive subjects — the killings of 1965 and religious extremism — in front of a rapt audience of some 150 people in The Hague recently. “Never again. This should never happen again. People have to learn about this tragedy,” Ahmad said shortly after reading a fragment from Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk, a novel that describes the suffering of ordinary civilians in the aftermath of Indonesia’s political turmoil in the 1960s. Ahmad, 64, was one of the main speakers at the annual Dutch literary event Writers Unlimited. When Writers Unlimited began two decades ago, it mainly focused on writers from countries with historical ties to the Netherlands. In later years it expanded to include authors from Latin America, Asia and the Middle East. Big Indonesian names like Rendra, Goenawan Mohamad and Leila S. Chudori were speakers in past years. Ahmad started writing Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk in the early 1980s, it was only in 2003 — 15 years after the fall of former president Soeharto — that the trilogy was published uncensored in Indonesia. Gen. Soeharto came to power after a failed coup in September 1965, blamed on the country’s Communist Party or PKI. The killings and arbitrary arrests of over a million people in the aftermath of the coup was a taboo subject during Soeharto’s three-decade rule. The author said he wrote the book because “it was my responsibility as an eyewitness”, although he knew that writing it during Soeharto’s time was risky. This, however, did not mean that he wasn’t scared. “While I wrote the book I felt like there was a pistol pointed to my head.” Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk reached a wider audience when it was brought to the big screen in 2011. Nevertheless, Ahmad has no illusions that his book is being read by many people beyond a small circle of students, teachers and intellectuals. Noted Dutch writer and documentary-maker Adriaan van Dis, who accompanied Ahmad on stage, said the book engulfed him. “I read it for five days straight. I was in another world.” “My book makes people think, and not just feel good. Maybe not many of my people like to think,” Ahmad said, chuckling sadly. Michel Maas, a Jakarta-based Dutch journalist who moderated the talk, pointed out that young Indonesian audiences were “shocked” after watching the US-made documentary The Act of Killing, in which perpetrators of 1965 killings detailed how they carried out the murders. “It was an eye-opener for many of these young Indonesians, who had no idea what happened during that time.” In a low voice, Ahmad added that no matter how graphically the documentary described the murders, “it can never be as cruel as the things I’ve seen in my village.” Asked after the talk what he meant by his statement, he hesitantly said, “Like this man who was the headmaster at my school. His son was only in junior high school, and they were, but enough about that.” His voice broke and he abruptly stopped, making it clear he did not want to relive that memory. It was not just the military that gave him the jitters when he wrote his book. “Some ulema were also not happy with me.” This, Ahmad explained, was very close to home as he comes from a religious family. Srintil, the main character of his book, was a village dancer who many deem sinful. My family asked “‘Why write about a prostitute?’. ‘That’s not proper as a good Muslim,’ they said.” “I quoted a Koran verse which says that everything under the sky belongs to God. This means a ronggeng also belongs to God, so why not write about her?” Asked whether the man, who still lives in his native village in Central Java’s Banyumas area, was worried that a more extreme form of Islam is expanding its influence in Indonesia, he answered: “I was born in Central Java, and I live amongst water buffaloes, not camels. I am Muslim in Indonesia, not in Saudi Arabia or Pakistan.” He trusts that most Muslims in Indonesia share his conviction. “Islam means peace, love and justice, and not just praying, fasting, or going on the haj.” Ahmad, looking frail in a brown batik shirt and woollen cap, gently urged that big issues should never be viewed in black and white. “When discussing 1965, please look at the political and social conditions which led to it,” pointing to the mounting hostility among Indonesia’s many factions in the years prior to the coup. He recalls that his father, who owned 1.5 hectares of land and had 12 children, was dubbed a “capitalist agent and the village devil” by the local chapter of the leftist Farmers Association or BTI. “If we don’t scrutinize these different aspects, we will never learn from history,” he said, questioning coyly whether the Dutch had learned anything from the colonial era in Indonesia. The same, he continues, goes for so-called Muslim fanaticism. “For example, look at the FPI [Islam Defenders Front]. Who are they? Who is behind them?” The root of the problem here, he said, is poverty and inequality. “Do you think most of those young men would use violence if they were going to school and had hope for a bright future?” As he is skeptical that those responsible for the 1965 killings would ever be brought to justice, he believes that a reconciliation effort, similar to that in South Africa, would be a more realistic path for Indonesia. The majority of the audience was graying, such as Barbara Brouwer, the wife of poet Sitor Situmorang. But some were younger, like consultant Flip Kuypers, 32, whose parents were born in Indonesia. “It was really interesting to hear about the events of 1965, which very few Dutch people are aware of.”",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/02/04/ahmad-tohari-remembering-1965-and-speaking-out.html,,2013
"Sat, February 16 2013","Groups threaten to attack mosque, church","Two groups in Jakarta and Bekasi threatened on Friday to attack two houses of worship, claiming that the mosque and church in question had caused disturbances in the respective areas. Congregations of the Damai Kristus Catholic Church in Tambora, West Jakarta, and the Al-Misbah Mosque in Pondok Gede, Bekasi, were threatened that their places of worship would be attacked if they did not comply with the groups’ warnings to halt activities at the sites. On Thursday, the Bekasi administration sealed the mosque, which is used by Ahmadiyah followers, with local worshippers saying they believed the threat came from the Jatibening wing of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Local government officials subsequently erected a sign saying that Ahmadiyah had been classified a heretical sect by the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) and, therefore, people were expected to desist from any activities in the mosque. One of the Ahmadis, Deden Darmawan Sudjana, said the threat had coincided with the swearing-in of the new FPI branch chairman. “We were surprised when they threatened an attack. In fact, we have had good relations with them for many years. This threat is the first since the mosque was established in the 1980s,” Deden told The Jakarta Post on Friday. “I personally had a very close relationship with their previous chairman, Idris, who passed away in 2011.” On Friday evening, around 200 Ahmadis were guarding the mosque to prevent any attack, along with the help of around 30 police personnel, Deden said. The Jakarta Legal Aid Institute (LBH) released a statement on Friday saying that the Bekasi administration had violated the law in forbidding the Ahmadis from worshipping in their mosque. “The Bekasi administration has no right to issue such an order. Only the central government can do that,” Yunita Purnama of LBH Jakarta said in the statement. Separately on Friday, around 200 people from the South Duri Mosque and Mushola Forum threatened to attack the church in Tambora. Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto said that police were following up and were conducting surveillance near the church. “From the information we have received, the group has canceled the attack.

Makassar Mayor Ilham Arief Sirajuddin condemned the terror acts as “barbaric”, saying that he supported the constitutional right of Christians to practice their religion. “Let us be united,” the mayor said on Sunday. In Tambora, West Jakarta, the Damai Kristus Catholic Church also held Sunday services, despite threats from the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) to use force to disperse the congregation. The hard-line group, some of whose members have engaged in vigilante violence against those they deem in violation of the law, have alleged that the church lacks a needed permit. Local FPI members came to the church on Friday to tell its minister and the congregation not to build a church and that the use of an unlicensed building for worship would not be tolerated. The congregation was formed in 1963 and has since operated a school. Its application for a permit to build a church on the site has been pending with officials since 1987. An employee of Damai Kristus Catholic Church who declined to be named to discuss the issue confirmed that four masses were held on Sunday and proceeded without incident. “We performed Sunday mass as usual,” said the employee. Damai Kristus parish priest Rev. Widyo did not respond to a telephone call and an SMS from The Jakarta Post asking for comment on Sunday. Contacted separately, Rev. Advent Nababan of the Batak Protestant Church (HKBP) in Setu in Bekasi, West Java, told the Post that his congregation also held mass without incident on Sunday. Members of several local hard-line and vigilante Muslim groups allegedly told the congregation that there would be serious consequences if it held mass on Sunday. “We managed to perform Sunday services today [Sunday]. The threats did not materialize,” Nababan said. Meanwhile, the chief of the Jakarta Christian Communications Forum, Theophilus Bella, told the Post that the number of threats against churches in Greater Jakarta has been increasing. “In 2012, I recorded 75 cases across Indonesia, 31 of which occurred in Greater Jakarta, up from 64 cases in the year before. The trend in such cases has shown a steady increase since 2009. So I am not surprised that we have already seen a number of threats in early 2013,” Theophilus said. The secretary of the National Counterterrorism Agency (BNPT), Air Marshall Chairul Akbar, said that the rising political tensions in Greater Jakarta might be exploited by irresponsible parties. “As we all can see, there have been many disputes related to the election of regional leaders, problems within the ruling party, flooding, among others,” he told the Post. “We see that some people are using this chaotic momentum for their own advantage.” (fzm)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/02/18/churchgoers-defy-threats-violent-attacks.html,,2013
"Thu, February 21 2013",Gov candidates duck religious intolerance issue,"Candidates in the West Java gubernatorial election seem to have ducked the question of religious intolerance and radicalism despite the province’s poor reputation on the matter. The Wahid Institute recorded that the number of cases of intolerance and violations against religious freedom have increased from 57 cases in 2010 to 128 in 2011. There were 102 cases in 2012. The institute’s head of monitoring and advocacy, M. Subhi Azhari, said that West Java had the highest number of violations of religious freedom and intolerance. The candidates have not offered many solutions during the current campaign period, which ends Wednesday. Intolerance and violations of religious freedom are not staple campaign material to attract votes from the West Java population, which is predominantly Muslim. Incumbent Deputy Governor Dede Yusuf Macan Effendi said he would build communication with religious leaders to solve the problems. “Staying in West Java means staying in an area that is peaceful, harmonious and conducive for investment,” he said. The former actor said he had mapped the potential for religion-related conflict in the province. “The key is good relations,” he said. Dede is part of the provincial administration that issued West Java Gubernatorial Decree No. 12/2011 banning Ahmadiyah propagation activities in the province. His competitor and boss, incumbent Governor Ahmad Heryawan, said the policy was made to prevent arbitrary or violent actions against Ahmadiyah followers. Heryawan said the police should help to maintain religious tolerance. Another way, he said, was to maximize the Interfaith Communication Forum (FKUB). “Most of the problems are about the construction of houses of worship. If all parties understand the prevailing law, there will be no problem,” he said. Many of the problems of constructing churches, for example, are related to building permits, which such establishments have yet to acquire before starting their worshipping activities. The incumbent governor added that it was also important to increase the school participation numbers and people’s welfare. Meanwhile, House of Representatives member Rieke Diah Pitaloka said that there should be a multiple-pronged approach to solve the problem. It includes communication to build understanding between religious groups through to improvement of the people’s economic condition. Rieke said that she would build food security in West Java by maximizing all potential. “If the people reach a satisfactory welfare level, they will not conduct outrageous actions,” said the only female gubernatorial candidate. Deputy governor candidate Tatang Fahanul Hakim said that the problems of intolerance and radicalism in West Java could be solved if society understood their religions. Political observer and dean of the School of Social Sciences at the Indonesian Education University, Karim Suryadi, said the issues would haunt every governor in the province. “Because there is a difference of understanding between the public and the media,” Karim said Monday. The public may not consider such debates in the media as a problem, he added. So, according to him, West Java leaders should be firm in responding to the differences in understanding. He deemed that all candidates had yet to provide a clear understanding on how to resolve the cases of religious intolerance. “Every one of them say they will accommodate all the differences, but concrete actions remain unclear,” said Karim. Religious intolerance cases in West Java 2012-2013 • Jan. 27, 2013, Bandung: Members of Islamic organizations forbid around 200 members of the Banua Niho Keriso Protestan (BNKP) church to conduct Sunday services. Dharma Zebua, a BNKP administrator, said that his congregation had obtained the relevant recommendation and permit from the Bandung Kidul district office to use the house for religious activities. • Oct. 25, 2012, Bandung: Members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) damage An-Nasir mosque and prohibit Ahmadis from celebrating Idul Adha. • Aug. 6, 2012, Bogor: Public Order Agency officers seal off the St. Johannes Catholic Church due to permit issues. Since 2007, the church had submitted all documents necessary for the building permit, but the administration always rejected the application. • April 20, 2012, Tasikmalaya: Hundreds of FPI members attack the Baiturahman Mosque belonging to Ahmadiyah followers. Nine are injured. • March 16, 2012, Indramayu: The church on Jl. Cimanuk, Indramayu, is shot at 20 times by unidentified men. No one died or was injured. • Feb. 17, 2012, Cianjur: A crowd of about 50 people vandalize Nur Hidayah Mosque used by 200 Ahmadiyah followers.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/02/21/gov-candidates-duck-religious-intolerance-issue.html,,2013
"Fri, February 22 2013",Yansen A. Binti: Pluralism and the Dayak Philosophy,"(JP/Setiono Sugiharto) Yansen A. Binti entered the media spotlight in 2012 when he led a rally against the arrival of four senior leaders of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) at Palangkaraya Tjilik Riwut airport, Central Kalimantan. Along with thousands of Dayak, he vigorously opposed the inauguration of a provincial chapter of the organization in the region. The FPI is infamous for instigating sectarian violence. “Palangkaraya is well-known for religious harmony and a peaceful lifestyle. The presence of a radical group like the FPI isn’t necessary. In fact, we already have the Inter-religious Harmony Forum (FKUB), which unites all people from different religions”, the local Dayak youth figure said. Yansen believes racial and religious harmony in Palangkaraya to be deeply rooted among the locals because of their strict adherence to the philosophy of the betang. Betang is a large, traditional Dayak house where family members of diverse religious faiths live together peacefully. “The Dayak tribes here realize that living a peaceful life is so valuable that it must be continuously preserved. We don’t want our region to be like other conflict-ridden regions like Poso and Ambon, which are constantlty marred by racial and religious clashes. Any attempt to disrupt our harmonious life here will be opposed”. Yansen is helping prepare for the Pekan Budaya Dayak (the exhibition of Dayak Culture) 2013 to be held on April 27-30 at the Bung Karno Sports Stadium, Jakarta. This exhibition, organized by the National Dayak Traditional Council (MADN), will promote the four island provinces (Central, East, West and South Kalimantan) in terms of its industry and business as well as its tourism, arts and cultural heritage. When asked why the exhibition will be held in Jakarta instead of in one of the provinces, Yansen explained that the event is an integrative program for the four provinces. “It is a national, not a local program, and Jakarta is the window of the nation, so people from all over Indonesia as well as in other countries can recognize the wealth of Kalimantan culture”. “Specifically we want all peoples of Indonesia and other countries to know the depth of the Dayak local inventiveness and culture which are grounded in the spirit of Bhineka Tunggal Ika (Unity in Diversity)”, Yansen said. During the interview, whenever his staff interrupted it for a signature or proofreading a draft letter Yansen always spoke Dayak, but he seemed uncomfortable speaking his native language in the presence of a guest and, rather peculiarly, apologized for doing so. Yansen is a graduate of Brawijaya University, Malang, East Java, majoring in economics, with a master’s degree from the Indonesian Institute of Management in Jakarta. Prior to embarking in politics as a member of the Palangkaraya legislative council, he was a lecturer at the Faculty of Economics, Palangkaraya University. Yansen’s resignation as a lecturer was motivated mainly by his personal desire to safeguard pluralism in the capital of Central Kalimantan through politics. Yansen’s active involvement in politics has influenced important decisions on local traditions and pluralism in Palangkaraya, the capital that is sometimes known Bumi Pancasila. One of these important decisions was the inauguration of the Dayak Societal Defense Body (BPMD), which was formed as an expansion of the Regional Regulation No. 16, 2009. This body comprises of security guards whose tasks are to protect the Damang (the customary chief) while he conducts his duties. These guards are similar to what the Balinese call pecalang. Another important decision was related to the local government policy of using and promoting use of the Dayak language in social service advertisements and banners in the public places. Sharing the secret of peaceful life in Palangkaraya and its remote regions, Yansen emphasizes that it is the local people’s awareness of, and their respect for, local wisdom that helps maintain social order in the capital and its regions.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/02/22/yansen-a-binti-pluralism-and-dayak-philosophy.html,,2013
"Sun, February 24 2013",The week in review: Unfolding drama,"With more twists and turns than the road to Puncak Pass in the hills of West Java, the political-legal drama involving Democratic Party chief Anas Urbaningrum took another dramatic, albeit not necessarily unexpected, turn this week. Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) spokesman Johan Budi on Friday announced that Anas had been named a suspect for allegedly taking bribes in relation to the construction of the Hambalang sports complex. “The KPK’s preliminary investigation has found strong evidence that shows the suspect’s involvement in a bribery case and other cases related to the construction of the Hambalang sports center,” Johan said. This latest development thickens the plot and dims the image of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s party since several key party figures have been implicated in the corruption case, including the Democratic Party’s former treasurer, Muhammad Nazaruddin, and former youth and sports minister Andi Mallarangeng. Just five days earlier, Yudhoyono, in his usual risk-averse style, succeeded in temporarily patching the internal rift in his party by insisting that he never had any intention of ousting Anas. Yudhoyono’s back-down, however, was as much about self-preservation as it was about uniting the party, as it was believed that the anti-Anas camp would have likely lost in a vote at an extraordinary congress to oust Anas. With Anas now effectively preoccupied with his legal wrangle, pro-SBY supporters will likely have a free hand in the party as had been their intent all along. The KPK’s decision will no doubt spark further debate in regards to “politicalization” of the Commission, as friction and quiet accusations emerged among KPK leaders during this case. A leaked KPK “document” naming Anas a graft suspect had emerged the previous week. The rift became apparent after commissioners made contradictory statements on the document. Only three KPK commissioners, chairman Abraham Samad and commissioners Adnan Pandu Praja and Zulkarnain had signed the document, while the columns for commissioners Bambang Widjojanto and Busyro Muqoddas were left blank. Speculation was rife that Busyro was reluctant to sign the document given his ties to the Association of Islamic Students (HMI), of which Anas served as chairman between 1997 and 1999. Meanwhile, Bambang wanted the KPK to build a stronger case against Anas before naming him a suspect. Adnan then withdrew his signature after learning that the KPK had not held a case presentation attended by all commissioners, as required. The only thing certain for now is that more drama will unfold in the months to come. As the nation was gripped in a pathetic political soap opera, more disconcerting news slipped under the radar. One of these was the continued persecution of religious groups in a country that prides itself on its diversity. In several parts of the country, members of several beleaguered Christian congregations defied the perils of new Molotov cocktail attacks and violent threats. In Makassar, South Sulawesi, five churches were attacked by vigilantes wielding Molotov cocktails. In Tambora, West Jakarta, Damai Kristus Catholic Church also held Sunday services, despite threats from the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) to use force to disperse the congregation. The hard-line group, some of whose members have engaged in vigilante violence against those who they deemed were in violation of the law, have alleged that the church lacked the necessary permit to operate. Local FPI members visited the church on Friday to tell its minister and congregation to not build a church and that the use of an unlicensed building for worship would not be tolerated. The events are a continuation of the depressing trend of threats against churches. According to sources, in 2012 there were 75 recorded cases of threats or attacks against churches across Indonesia. The most distressing matter that has failed to capture the headlines above the din of political drama has been the alarming increase of child abuse cases. Data from the Greater Jakarta area shows that last year there were 2,637 reported child abuse cases, of which 1,075 of these incorporated a sexual dimension. This represents a significant and steady jump from the 1,500 cases in 2009 and 2,508 in 2011. Over 80 percent of the child abuse cases had occurred in the lower strata of society. Sexually related crimes ranged from sodomy, to rape, molestation and incest. These reported incidents may only be the tip of the iceberg as a twisted perception still exists that child abuse was an internal, domestic problem, and was only the concern of the family involved. Neighbors and others who may be aware or have suspicions regarding a particular situation tend to look the other way. Furthermore, the “empathy” of the legal system toward these cases is severely lacking. According to various child protection groups, more than half of the cases have failed to reach the courts, with law enforcement agencies complaining of a lack of hard evidence. Poverty is also a factor in the high number of child abuse cases. Mothers are often afraid to lose the breadwinner if they report their husbands to the police for sexual violence. Perhaps it’s time for our nation’s leaders to start paying attention to “real” human problems rather than their own squabbles. — Meidyatama Suryodiningrat",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/02/24/the-week-review-unfolding-drama.html,,2013
"Wed, March 6 2013",Commentary: Why calling for disbandment of FPI is wrong and dangerous,"In the next few weeks, Indonesia’s liberal-minded middle class will possibly get what they have always wanted: the end of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). This is because by the end of this month at the latest, the House of Representatives will pass into law a bill that, if enacted, will allow the government to freeze or dissolve an organization for operating against the state ideology of Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution. The Mass Organizations Bill will replace the 1985 law of the same name, which Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi once said had prevented him from taking swift action on “violent groups”. This is almost like a dream come true. The FPI has long been accused of acting against everything Pancasila stands for. The group is violent — at least it used to be, according to our records — and definitely has trouble coexisting with people who disagree with them, especially the educated middle class who may not like Lady Gaga but want to know the country is open to all foreign performers, no matter how controversial they are. The proposal to revise the 1985 law came when online calls mounted for the government to outlaw the FPI. The imminent passage of the bill will surely give hope to those who have long dreamed of an Indonesia without the FPI, like feminist Ratna Sarumpaet, who initiated a petition against the FPI on the social movement website, change.org. This may sound encouraging to Ratna, but I beg to differ. As a liberal myself, I am against any form of religious fascism, but I think calling on the government to disable the FPI is wrong, hypocritical and even dangerous. First of all, it is detrimental to the basic principle of democracy, of peaceful coexistence. The problem with the FPI is the violent behavior of its members. The government’s job is to ensure they play by the rules, not to deny their right to freedom of association. Furthermore, such a call could be used as a pretext to bring back authoritarianism to this country. We have lived in a democracy for more than 14 years, but the specter of Soeharto’s authoritarianism has not left. It haunts us every time we feel democracy is failing us. In the past few years, the government has attempted to pass legislation deemed as draconian by human rights activists. This bill, known as the “Ormas” bill, is just one of a few legislative proposals that could turn the clock back to a time when it was not okay to say anything bad about the government, let alone the first family. At the end of the day, this is not about the FPI. Several Islamic groups and human rights defenders, including those at the United Nations, have voiced their concerns about the possible adverse outcome of the bill’s enactment. For Islamic groups, the bill brings to mind Soeharto’s asas tunggal policy that criminalized those who subscribed to any ideology other than Pancasila. The policy was to blame for the 1984 Tanjung Priok tragedy during which human rights abuses are believed to have taken place. For rights defenders, it will only worsen the persecution against “dangerous” people. The bill stipulates that any organization operating in the country, including foreign NGOs, must uphold Pancasila or other ideologies that do not contradict it. The bill does not specify what those other ideologies are, but atheism and communism are definitely not on the list. While it is far-fetched to assume the bill, when enacted, will trigger a sort of witch-hunt, it is perfectly reasonable to be anxious that it could be used by the powers that be to take our freedom away. It is likely too late to block the passage of the bill. The House’s special committee tasked with deliberating the bill said it had resolved almost all contentious issues and would soon bring it to plenary for approval. Human rights activists have failed to convince the lawmakers to suspend the bill’s approval, while Islamic groups are calling for lawmakers to insert a clause in the bill stating that liberalism and atheism have no place in the country. The bill, of course, will likely foment the culture war between Muslim conservatives and liberals — most of them are Muslims, too — in the country. But it may no longer be a fair fight between the two, as the government may step in at any time to end the battle the wrong way. In a democracy, it is natural for people to differ and compete for influence. Even in the United States, the world’s evangelistic democracy, religious conservatism still influences the process of policy and law-making. The problem in Indonesia is that the government has failed to enforce the law. It has failed to punish those who do not play by the rules, and tacitly condoned the violent behavior of militants. The answer to this problem is not to devise potentially draconian legislation, but to make a stronger commitment to carrying out political and judicial reforms. This may take a while and we need to be patient. It is a truism to say that without strong law enforcement democracy can easily turn into anarchy. But this is exactly what is happening in Indonesia. There is no excuse to let the recalcitrant FPI members get a slap on the wrist or go unpunished for repeatedly breaking the law. But that is by no means a pretext to revive Soeharto’s authoritarianism. If we believe in democracy and cherish our freedom, we may have to let the FPI remain among us.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/03/06/commentary-why-calling-disbandment-fpi-wrong-and-dangerous.html,,2013

They intimidate everyone else through violence. Get rid of their association, then you solve the problem. Jaytee Indonesia is a democratic (pluralistic) country based on Pancasila. If the liberal democratic government of Indonesia cannot guarantee social, political, economic and religious freedoms to all of its citizens, then the democracy is meaningless! Radical organizations demand exclusivity in the implementation of their dogmatic views that incite hatred and violence to other citizens, rendering democratic rules meaningless. Not all non-democratic countries are dysfunctional; look at Singapore, China, South Korea and so on. In Europe, a democratic liberal government outlawed the preaching of Muslim clerics that incited hatred, racism and violence. Europe dismantled extreme Muslim organizations like Sharia 4 Belgium, and jailed the leaders. The government should place constitutional liberalism in the highest position and put the rule of law alongside it to guarantee a pluralist society. The government should implement and guarantee political, social, economic and religious freedoms to all of its citizens. Yes, law enforcement to maintain a democratic/pluralistic society should take center stage! YL Wape",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/03/09/issues-day-calling-disbandment-fpi-wrong.html,,2013

I would like to highlight some points in this article: “[...]especially the educated middle class who may not like Lady Gaga butwant to know the country is open to all foreign performers, no matterhow controversial they are.” Yes, I have never been a fan ofLady Gaga, I think she’s quite weird and has strange taste of fashion,never liked her music.

"Sat, March 16 2013",FPI: Depok red-light raids ‘half-hearted’,"Members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) in Depok gathered outside the mayoralty office compound on Friday to protest, what they deemed to be, the half-hearted raids in red-light areas by the Public Order Agency (Satpol PP). The protesters demanded that the administration and the police permanently close venues they believed to accommodate prostitution in the municipality. “If the administration does not do it right, we will take over the raids,” FPI Depok chairman Habib Idrus Algadri said, adding the accusation that the prostitution business was backed by some political party members. On Thursday, Satpol PP officers and a team from Depok police closed over 50 cafes allegedly providing illicit sex in Pondok Rangon, which borders Depok, Bekasi and East Jakarta. Many of the cafes raided had been abandoned by the owners prior to the raids. Some of the cafe owners resisted closure and claimed that their businesses were legal. However, during the raids, the officers found unmarried couples in the bedrooms at the cafes. The officers also confiscated hundreds of bottles of alcohol although the cafes did not hold the relevant license to sell alcohol. On Wednesday, officers sealed Duta Residence Hotel in Sukmajaya for running a business without a permit after residents reported it for allegedly accommodating prostitution. “Those raids were fake because we found couples still committed adultery in those places afterwards,” Habib Idrus said. The rally on Friday was guarded by dozens of police officers with police women deployed to prevent protesters from forcing their way in to City Hall. Satpol PP chief Gandara Budiana declined the accusation of fake raids and hotel closure. “We banned activities in Pondok Rangon in July last year, but the residents broke the seal on the cafes and resumed the night activities. This time, we are determined to bring the offenders to court,” he said. Separately in Tangerang regency, the administration had made it clear that it would take stern measures against the presence of amusement places at Citra Raya residential area in Cikupa district. Tangerang Public Order Agency chief Teteng Jumara said the residents had filed complaints over alleged prostitution in the area. “We will execute all illegal amusement places, mostly massage parlors, in the near future. We are just waiting for a written instruction from Regent Ismet Iskandar,” he said. The agency found that only one of the amusement places could show an operating permit issued by the administration, Teteng said, declining to name the businesses to be closed in the near future.

"Sat, March 23 2013",Leadership deficit fuels intolerance,"United States President Barack Obama praised “the spirit of religious tolerance that is enshrined in Indonesia’s constitution, and that remains one of its defining and inspiring characteristics” during a visit to Jakarta in November 2010. Tell that to the Ahmadiyah community in Cikeusik, Banten. Barely three months after Obama sang the praises of Indonesia’s religious harmony, a group of some 1,500 Islamist militants attacked 21 members of Cikeusik’s Ahmadiyah community who were holding a prayer meeting in a private home on Feb. 6, 2011. The militants bludgeoned three Ahmadis to death and injured five others. A court sentenced 12 of the perpetrators to prison sentences of three-to-six months. Adding insult to injury, the court also sentenced an Ahmadiyah man to a six-month prison term for attempting to defend himself. Police have yet to publicly release results of their internal investigation into the attack. As a new report from Human Rights Watch describes, religious intolerance and acts of violence targeting religious minorities are increasingly frequent in Indonesia. The new study documents how religious minorities, including several Protestant groups, Shia Muslims and Ahmadiyah, are targets of increasingly routine intimidation, threats and violence. The harassment and intimidation has included disrupting the religious observances of minority faiths with protests amplified by high-volume loudspeakers and the dumping of animal carcasses, feces and rotten eggs on the doorsteps of houses of worship. Adding to the fear stalking religious minorities is the government’s failure to protect the victims of these attacks and bring their perpetrators to justice. Groups such as the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) have become emboldened — and increasingly more violent — in their tactics of mobilizing masses of “protesters” to swarm minority houses of worship and harass, intimidate or physically attack their congregants. Those gangs justify their abuses as efforts to defend the Muslim community against Christian proselytization and rid the country of “infidels” and “blasphemers”. Those have not been empty threats. Setara Institute, which monitors religious freedom in Indonesia, has compiled statistics which indicate cases of violent attacks on religious minorities rose to 264 incidents in 2012 from 216 in 2010. Kontras, Indonesia’s leading nongovernmental human rights organization, documented a total of 18 incidents of religious-motivated intimidation, discrimination and violence — including an arson attack on a Makassar church — in the first six weeks of 2013 alone. The Shia Muslim community in Sampang regency, East Java, knows firsthand both the depredation of violent extremists and official apathy in confronting them. On Aug. 20, 2012, hundreds of Sunni militants attacked the community, torching some 50 homes, killing one man and seriously injuring another. The local police, warned ahead of time of the impending violence, stood by at the scene of the attack and declined to intervene. Such government indifference to the plight of religious minorities targeted by groups like the FPI or intolerant neighbors is a growing concern. In several incidents we investigated, local officials and security forces facilitated harassment and intimidation of religious minorities — in some cases even blaming the victims for the violent attacks. Officials have made discriminatory statements, refused to issue building permits for houses of worship even when all relevant regulations were complied with, and pressured minority congregations to relocate. In two cases, local officials have refused to implement Supreme Court decisions granting minority groups the right to build houses of worship. Indonesian government institutions in some instances have exacerbated religious intolerance, in direct contravention of the guarantee in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Indonesia ratified in 2005, that “persons belonging to [...] minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice their own religion”. The Religious Affairs Ministry, the Coordinating Board for Monitoring Mystical Beliefs in Society (Bakor Pakem) under the Attorney General’s Office, and the semi-official Indonesian Ulema Council, have eroded religious freedom by issuing decrees and fatwas (edicts) against members of religious minorities and using their position of authority to press for the prosecution of “blasphemers”. Official responsibility for the state failure to adequately confront rising extremism goes to the very top of Indonesia’s government. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s response to rising incidents of religious intolerance and related violence has been empty rhetoric rather than decisive action in support of besieged religious minorities and the rule of law. Even worse, Yudhoyono has turned a blind eye to members of his government who have explicitly encouraged abuses, including Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali, whose hostile comments about the Shia and the Ahmadiyah have included a speech he made at a March 2011 political convention exhorting the government to “ban Ahmadiyah”and comments in September 2012 suggesting mass conversion of Shia to Sunni Islam as the solution to anti-Shia sentiment and violence. The police appear to have taken their cue from those poor examples. Police have on some occasions sided with Islamist militants at the expense of the rights of religious minorities, ostensibly to avoid violence. Rather than investigating and arresting groups and individuals implicated in threats or physical attacks on religious minorities, police have sometimes opted to persuade the victims of such attacks to leave the area or close their houses of worship. Shamefully, police have in some cases colluded with the attackers for religious, economic, or political reasons. In other instances, they choose a course of inaction due to a lack of clear directives from above or concerns that militants outnumber the police. Across the board, the absence of effective police action reflects an institutional failure to hold perpetrators of violent crimes to account and uphold the law. The lack of leadership by President Yudhoyono to stand down religious militants and defend religious freedom and tolerance is serving only to ensure that religious minorities continue to face harassment, intimidation and physical attack by vigilante thugs espousing a creed at violent odds with Indonesian law. While the targets today are mostly members of relatively small, politically weak minority groups, the situation could well multiply if the violence and harassment are not nipped in the bud. Intolerance has a way of spreading, and a few years down the road one could see competing groups within the Sunni majority in Indonesia trying to impose their will on co-religionists through intimidation and violence rather than persuasion. What is needed is swift and decisive action by President Yudhoyono beginning with a clear message to police and prosecutors that alleged perpetrators of violence against religious minorities must face investigation and prosecution. Such “zero tolerance” for violence should be put into effect immediately. Human Rights Watch believes the president should also make clear that all government officials, including members of his own cabinet, who make discriminatory comments or condone or encourage harassment of religious minorities will face immediate consequences, up to and including dismissal. We are also urging President Yudhoyono to convene a high-level working group composed of people of stature, known for their independence, to map out a national strategy for safeguarding religious freedom and curbing acts of violence in the name of religion. The working group mandate should include reviewing laws, regulations and decrees that have facilitated discrimination and violation of religious minority rights. The clock is ticking. For each day that President Yudhoyono fails to act against the rising trend of religious intolerance and violence, the list of victims and grievances grows ever longer. Without a sustained and decisive government defense of religious freedom, the “spirit of religious tolerance” praised by President Obama becomes ever more distant.

HKBP was demolished on Thursday by local public order officers (Satpol PP). Antara/Paramayuda March 21, Online The Batak Protestant Church (HKBP) in Setu in Bekasi, West Java, was demolished on Thursday afternoon, according to a church leader who said that a lawsuit would be filed against the local administration. “It’s over. The church was demolished at around 2:45 p.m.,” Rev.Torang Parulian Simanjuntak told The Jakarta Post over the phone today. HKBP Setu congregation members went to the church on Thursday morning to attempt to stop the demolition of the church as public order officers (Satpol PP) arrived at the location. They held a prayer service and prayed in the church, hoping that the demolition would not happen. A bulldozer arrived at the location around 11 a.m. Members of the church’s congregation began to cry and scream while some tried to prevent the bulldozer from moving closer to the church. Many broke down when it began to tear apart the walls of the church located on Jl. MT Haryono. They called on the Satpol PP officers, asking them to stop the demolition. Your comments: Absolutely nothing can stop us from congregating and praying to our Father. Now leave the ruins alone. Do not fight back. Instead, go peacefully to the forests or hills or any place on earth that can accommodate your congregation. Even underground cemeteries will do. Just exactly like what our predecessors, the early Christians, did to avoid violent attacks by Roman authorities. Then pray to our Father in heaven to forgive and bless those people in Bekasi who attacked you. Never worry about the thing you call a church. Let them destroy it and burn it. It is just a building made of bricks, sand and stones that has absolutely no religious value at all. The Lord lives deep in our hearts. We can meet Him, praise Him and pray to Him from any place on earth. From outer space to the bottom of the sea, let us remember how our founding fathers, early Christians, had to move from one hidden place to another to avoid violence. Robby Kaware It is amusing that under the military government of Soeharto, there was more tolerance and equality than under democracy.

This sad and tragic story illustrates the irony as well as contradictive state of affairs in a nation that claims in its constitution a “belief in one supreme God”, adherence to “social justice” and “community welfare” — yet allows this intolerance and religious unrest to remain unresolved. When will we come to realize and rise to take appropriate, just action to prove that this is a time when destruction and violence is not strength, compassion, collaboration and communities working together is not weakness?

"Sat, April 6 2013",Bekasi Ahmadis in stand off,"Forcible eviction: A woman (second right) weeps after local authorities forcibly closed the Al-Misbah mosque belonging to the Indonesia Ahmadiyah Congregation in Bekasi, West Java, on Friday. The public order officers said the mosque was sealed off in line with Bekasi Mayoral Regulation No.40/2001, which prohibits the congregation from conducting any activities at the mosque.(Antara/Widodo S. Jusuf) Around 50 Ahmadis in Bekasi, West Java, have sealed themselves in the Al-Misbah Mosque, which the municipal administration closed the day before in a crack down. The Ahmadis have refused to leave the mosque, which has been surrounded by a corrugated sheet fence that was erected by the administration on Thursday. The security coordinator for the group, Deden Sudjana, said on Friday that local Ahmadis had received several threats before the mosque was sealed by officials. “The government should have protected us as citizens, not treated us cruelly like this,” Deden told The Jakarta Post. “We just want to pray.” Deden said that officials began to close down the mosque at 1 p.m., when 200 officers from the Bekasi Public Order Agency and the Pondok Gede police precinct and several soldiers from the Indonesian Military (TNI) arrived on the scene. On Friday afternoon, according to Deden, around 400 police officers tried to evacuate the Ahmadis from the mosque following rumors that 2,000 members of the hard-line Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) were planning to attack. Police abandoned the evacuation attempt after a meeting with the Ahmadis that was moderated by representatives of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI) and the Wahid Institute, an NGO that promotes pluralism, Deden said. However, Bekasi Police chief Sr. Comr. Priyo Widiyanto told the Post that the situation was at the mosque was “normal” and that no evacuation was attempted or needed, although 20 officers were on hand to provide security Deden said that the local administration had justified shutting down the mosque under the terms of a West Java gubernatorial decree and the 2008 joint ministerial decree banning members of the Ahmadiyah Indonesia Congregation (JAI) from propagating their religious beliefs. The YLBHI said in a statement that it condemned the Bekasi administration’s move to seal the mosque, which it said had violated provisions of the 1945 Constitution stating that “all citizens have the right to hold their beliefs and exercise their beliefs”. The statement also questioned why TNI troops were on hand when the fence was erected, as the military’s principal duty was national defense. The closure of the mosque is not a first for the nation’s beleaguered Ahmadi community. In 2005, hundreds of Ahmadis in West Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara (NTB), were evicted from their homes and lived in shelters in Mataram, NTB, for five years after an attack by a group that considered the Ahmadhis as deviant Muslims.

"Mon, April 15, 2013",Editorial: No to 'Äòormas'Äô law,"On Thursday, the House of Representatives halted deliberation of the controversial bill on mass organizations, delaying it to the next sitting, only after mounting public resistance to the draft law to amend the 1985 law. Lawmakers claim the old law needs to be adapted for the decentralized, democratic era and a new law is needed to 'Äúdiscipline'Äù problematic organizations and if necessary, ban them. The thousands of foreign organizations should also be regulated, they say, to ensure accountability and state security. Both human rights groups and religious organizations have objected to the bill, evoking the repressive past when vague rules were used to trample dissent. Lawmakers have made changes but have not converted the critics who still question loopholes that could be used against any organization. Changes to ensure, for instance, that all organizations have basic principles 'Äúwhich do not contradict'Äù the state ideology of Pancasila and the Constitution, still leave questions as to how this could be interpreted by authorities. In short, the New Order'Äôs creeds of monoloyalitas, single loyalty to the state, and azas tunggal, the compulsory adherence to Pancasila and only Pancasila, have brought back the trauma experienced by many, whether Islamist groups or those labelled secular and liberal. These groups are among those who were spied on and arrested, tortured, kidnapped and even murdered on the grounds that they were suspected of treason or jeopardizing stability. We agree with the protesters 'Äî the latest rally against the bill was held on Friday 'Äî that the mass organizations bill should be dropped altogether, and the 1985 law annuled. The law has lost its relevance with progressive amendments to the Consitution, which guarantees freedom of assembly and association. The excuses of regulating the financial affairs of problematic organizations regarding will overlap with other laws such as the laws on foundations and corruption. The 28-year old law on mass organizations showed a state bent on controlling every sign of dissent. The New Order maintained power for so long by at least a veneer of compliance to the rule of law; it also succeeded in fostering mutual suspicion in society. We see remains of this legacy to this day 'Äî like the inability to have a healthy debate to resolve differences 'Äî contributing to a fragile democracy. Continuing to have a law regulating which organization is acceptable and which is not, will only strengthen mutual distrust. In the reformasi era, ideas to amend the 1985 law followed calls to disband religious vigilante groups. People were fed up of violence perpetrated in the name of God, such as those involving the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). But as others pointed out, disbanding any group would pave the way straight back to state authority to ban any organization or group 'Äî while the FPI and similar groups simply rely on the glaring lack of simple law enforcement by the police. Firm law enforcement, fostering freedom, encouraging independent thought and nonviolent debate, will strengthen society and reduce the remaining distrust in the state. And as Indonesians are steeped in the teachings of Pancasila, some pointed out, not everyone who looks religous should be suspected of plotting treason.

"Fri, May 24, 2013",Religious minorities unite for freedom,"Iron: Pondok Gede sub-precinct head Comr. Dedy Tabrani speaks to an Ahmadi behind the locked gate of the Al Misbah Mosque in Bekasi on April 5. (Antara/Widodo S. Jusuf) Next to a sealed Ahmadi mosque in Bekasi is a plot of land with leafy trees and damp earth. To get in one has to squeeze through a gap between a tall iron gate and the wall of a residence on the other side. From this bit of land, Ahmadiyah members send food over the gate to the 19 Ahmadis staying inside the mosque, which was sealed in early April by Bekasi public order officers. When the officers put up the corrugated iron fence to seal the Al Misbah Mosque, about 40 people were inside, including women and children. The women and children have since been taken out. The remaining 19 stayed behind, giving away their freedom for an indefinite time as a symbol, an act of protest, toward the Bekasi municipality and the central government for meddling with their freedom to worship. The lot became a gathering place on Saturday night for Sobat KBB, a solidarity group of victims of religious intolerance and violence, a collective of minority groups 'Äî Christians, Shia Muslims, Ahmadis and those of other beliefs 'Äî that have experienced discrimination and persecution. Sobat translates as friend in English. The national coordinator of Sobat KBB is Palti Panjaitan, the Filadelfia Batak Christian Protestant Church pastor whose church in Bekasi was also sealed by the Bekasi city administration. Palti said about 10 people came to the gathering. Liberal Islam activist Mohammad Guntur Romli, who in a pluralism rally that turned violent in 2008 had his nose and cheekbone fractured by blows from members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), and Nong Darol Mahmada were among the attendees. Over grilled fish, the group shared their thoughts about the state of religious minorities in Indonesia. Rahmat Rahmadijaya, an Ahmadiyah cleric who remains inside the shuttered mosque, joined the discussion through a small opening in the mosque'Äôs black iron door. Ahmadiyah spokesperson Firdaus Mubarik said they wanted to bring Palti into their campaign because they saw the creative ways the Filadelfia church had promoted their cause, such as holding mass in front of the presidential palace. Firdaus said the Ahmadis collaborated with Filadelfia for the Saturday night gathering 'Äî aimed at becoming a regular meeting 'Äî to continue to voice their cause. 'ÄúWe don'Äôt want the people remaining in the mosque to be forgotten,'Äù he said. Palti, meanwhile, said they might make the gathering more regular, not only in the lot next to Al Misbah but in other places where religious minorities are persecuted. The group was established in February after a workshop by the Setara Institute, a human rights organization that monitors religious freedom across the country, and is also open to agnostics and atheists, the priest said. 'ÄúSobat KBB is open to any victims [of persecution] including atheists. We fight for all victims who have been victimized or discriminated against in the name of religion, either those who adhere to religion or those who do not. We will fight hand in hand, to support each other,'Äù Palti said. Local and international organizations have criticized Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono'Äôs administration for the increasing religious intolerance and violence in the country, even as he recently received the World Statesman Award from the US-based Appeal of Conscience Foundation. The award has been deemed a publicity stunt by rights groups who say the president does not deserve the award because of his track record in dealing with religious minorities. Setara has documented 264 cases of violent attacks against religious minorities, up from 244 cases in 211 and 216 cases in 2010. Meanwhile, non-believers are criminalized, as in the case of atheist Alexander Aa, who broadcast his thoughts about the non-existence of God and was put behind bars in 2012. 'ÄúWe want to enlighten people that religion should not be used to judge other religions or beliefs,'Äù Palti said of Sobat KBB. Struggling: Nineteen Ahmadis are staying inside the Al Misbah Mosque in Bekasi, which was sealed by Bekasi public order officers in April. (JP/Prodita Sabarini) In the case of Ahmadiyah, a 2008 joint ministerial decree banned the sect from proselytizing and the decree became the base for the regional government to ban Ahmadiyah outright. The West Java administration banned Ahmadiyah activities in 2011, the same year the Bekasi mayoralty announced its ban. From across the corrugated iron fence, Rahmat, 33, who has been living on the grounds of the mosque for a decade, said Islamic hardliners from the FPI started to intimidate and harass Ahmadis at Friday prayers after Bekasi mayor Rahmat Effendi announced the ban. 'ÄúThey threatened us, roaring their motorcycle engines, disturbing our prayers,'Äù he said. Except for Rahmat and a resident living next to the mosque, the neighbors of the mosque are not Ahmadis. Ahmadis from other parts of Bekasi come and pray there on Fridays. But a resident living nearby said people were nonplussed with them. 'ÄúFor us here, to each their own'Äù. Rahmat said the Bekasi administration'Äôs sealing of the mosque was the latter'Äôs idea to protect the Ahmadis from religious hardliners. 'ÄúBut they did it without consulting us first, there was no dialogue,'Äù he said. The mosque is now guarded by three police officers, who take shelter from boredom in the house in front of the mosque where they can watch television when nothing is happening. The police presence ensures no-one enters the mosque, either Ahmadis or hardliners. A number of times after the mosque was sealed hardliners have arrived, but were cordoned off by the police. 'ÄúWe feel shackled, it'Äôs tough being here,'Äù Rahmat said. The young cleric is living separately from his wife and two children. The youngest was born in February. His days are used to pray, he said. They also entertain themselves with badminton and ping pong. Rahmat said they have sent letters of protest to the president and the mayor. The Ahmadis are also taking their case against the Bekasi administration to the administrative court. Even though the government is not keeping the Ahmadis inside the mosque, Rahmat said he would stay locked inside until the government reopened it. 'ÄúForever, we will stay here forever,'Äù he said. But, he doesn'Äôt wish for that. Rahmat is instead hoping for divine intervention to help the embattled Ahmadis win their case.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/05/24/religious-minorities-unite-freedom.html,,2013
"Sat, June 15, 2013",Comments: FPI diversifies business to land conflicts,"June 11, p2 The Islam Defenders Front (FPI), notorious for its violent raids supposedly in support of sharia, is diversifying. The Islamic defenders are now available for hire to defend your disputed property. The extremist group is now fighting housing developer PT Alam Sutra over disputed land in Paku Alam village, South Tangerang.

Furthermore, it is clearly stated in the Koran that Muhammad is merciful to all mankind. And what is the purpose of being the defender of Islam, who asked them to do so?

"Sun, June 30, 2013",View Point: Mea culpa: Sorry seems to be the hardest word,"Jay Rayner'Äôs amusing 2005 novel, The Apologist, tells the fictional story of Marc Basset who is so good at apologizing that he is appointed the UN'Äôs chief apologist. But the faÃ§ade of hypocrisy unravels as Basset must ultimately apologize for his apologizing. Apologies are as common a vernacular in daily life as expressions of gratitude. But while 'Äúthank yous'Äù are usually a more genuine heartfelt expression, 'Äúapologies'Äù are laced with nuance and double meaning without necessarily being contrite. Every girl in history has questioned the sincerity of a boyfriend'Äôs apology with a thought of words that do not match the deed. Bring in the specter of diplomacy, politics and law; then, apologies become a complex double entendre of negotiated meanings where regret may not concede the offense, let alone remorse. At the extreme end, there are individuals like Islam Defenders Front (FPI) spokesman Munarman, whose definition of decency is to fling water at panelists during a televised debate. But we shouldn'Äôt be surprised at the conduct of someone who speaks for thugs and has been convicted for inciting violence. Even Germany apologized for Nazi era crimes. So, if the FPI spokesman refused to apologize for his abhorrent behavior 'Äî distant and recent 'Äî then should we be blamed for thinking in terms of facist behavior? Such insolence is not the monopoly of facists and fanatics. At times, the greater the democracy, the greater the conceitedness, even at the expense of life and destruction. The United States purports high moral standards for its own people, but apparently not others whom they consider a threat. It expressed regret when its navy shot down an Iranian commercial airliner, killing 290 people in 1988, and accidently bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999. But no formal apology was forthcoming. Sometimes, such statements need to be coerced. Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu apologized for a raid on a Turkish ship in 2010 that killed nine, only after some arm twisting from US President Barack Obama. In 2001, a US reconnaissance plane collided with a Chinese jetfighter. The fighter crashed and the US plane made an emergency landing on Hainan Island. After holding the American crew for 11 days, Beijing was able to extract a letter in which president George W. Bush and secretary of state Colin Powell expressed 'Äúsincere regret'Äù. France apologized a year after its agents sank the Greenpeace ship, Rainbow Warrior, docked in New Zealand in 1985, following a political deal brokered by the UN. So, why did President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono apologize to Singapore and Malaysia for the recent haze? His initiative was received with as much shock at home as it was deference in the two neighboring capitals. There are several reasons why a state would make an apology, apart from it being a binding judgment as in the Rainbow Warrior case or being coerced like Netanyahu. It is improbable that Yudhoyono faced the same exigency as either France or Israel last week. Apologies help restore international reputation, as with Washington'Äôs outward contrition about the Abu Ghraib prison abuses. It can also be part of a low-cost tool to avoid conflagration by defusing troublesome incidents, hence a way of avoiding legal consequences while promoting the perception that the state should not be perceived as a threat to its neighbors. On the surface, it was certainly a 'Äúgracious'Äù act on the part of Yudhoyono, as described by Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Yet, history has also taught us that leaders must be wise even more than they are gracious. The apology, said Indonesian Bishops Conference (KWI) secretary Benny Susetyo, 'Äúis a symbol of a government that cannot resolve its own problems'Äù. Muhammadiyah chairman Din Syamsuddin probably put it best when he questioned why the President did not convey an equal apology to the people of Riau who suffered more than anyone in Singapore or Malaysia. It becomes even more striking when we recount that the incumbent has been one of the most hesitant to issue 'Äúapologies'Äù to his own people compared to his predecessors. BJ Habibie apologized to victims of Aceh'Äôs Military Operation Zone (DOM) and those of the May 1998 tragedy, while Abdurrahman 'ÄúGus Dur'Äù Wahid apologized for the violence in Papua. Megawati Soekarnoputri set up two human rights tribunals: one to address the violence in East Timor (Timor Leste) in 1999 and the other to address the 1984 Tanjung Priok massacre. Given these considerations, we can only advise our Singaporean and Malaysian friends to take the apology as more rhetorical and ritualistic than genuine, as is the case with many other of the President'Äôs statements. Even Yudhoyono'Äôs own Cabinet was either coy or dismissive of his apology. Coordinating People'Äôs Welfare Minister Agung Laksono described the apology as merely a personal one, while Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa tried not to answer reporters'Äô questions by saying what the President had said was 'Äúclear'Äù. It is a bit like the Japanese. Despite their repeated 'Äúapologies'Äù about World War II, there remains more than a hint of doubt over their sincerity given the continued glorification of the war effort in history books and the Yasukuni Shrine. Sincerity begins at home. Both Canada and the United States apologized for the internment of its Japanese citizens during World War II. The late pope, John Paul II, issued an apology in 2000 for historic wrongs committed by the Catholic church. Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States all apologized to their indigenous populations. Even president Bill Clinton signed in 1993 a resolution apologizing for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Perhaps Yudhoyono may not have time to ponder the lessons of The Apologist, but he can still digest Bernie Taupin'Äôs lyrics in Elton'Äôs John'Äôs classic 'ÄúSorry seems to be the hardest word'Äù: 'ÄúIt'Äôs a sad, sad situation/And it'Äôs getting more and more absurd!'Äù",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/06/30/view-point-mea-culpa-sorry-seems-be-hardest-word.html,,2013
"Tue, July 2, 2013",Issue of the day: Refusing to apologize for water attack,"June 28, Online Islam Defenders Front (FPI) spokesman Munarman voiced no regrets after throwing water at University of Indonesia (UI) sociologist Thamrin Amal Tomagola during a live television talk show. Munarman said, as quoted by kontan.co.id, he had the right to do what he did because he was displeased with one of Thamrin'Äôs responses during the discussion, which centered on the police ban of public sweepings during Ramadhan. Your comments: Naturally his resort to such actions only illustrates the fact that he is socially inept and sadly lacking of any reasonable intelligence. In his world this is how matters are tackled. What a shame to be calling himself a Muslim and a defender of Islam. Nature Munarman just followed his personal religious insight as a Muslim. And obviously, as a good and honest lawyer he is, he wishes to impose his good and sharia based beliefs on others. Nirvana This reveals that Munarman and his friends have no respect for any language except the language of the fist. Knowing that, the powers of the democratically elected state must keep them under control. He is showing himself to be the immature, impolite, uncivilized person that he is. Like a small child, he is unable to control his emotions. Deedee S If Munarman really knew and understood Islam, he would not attack Thamrin. I believe people who use violence are those who grasp knowledge and religion shallowly. Fika Osman I do agree with sharia law, but not forcibly enacted. There are many ways to get blessings. Islam acknowledges pluralism. Due to the fact that Munarman did this he is obviously not ready to be a leader. Sadly, he said he was representing Muslims. It'Äôs embarrassing and not taught by our Prophet. How can Munarman control his men if he cannot control himself. Don'Äôt be a leader if you are not good. Kelik Public sweepings are illegal and are the jurisdiction of the police. He and his friends are breaking the law and should be prosecuted. Deddy K The sad thing about this whole episode is that the majority agree that it is unacceptable behavior.  Still they do nothing about it. Unfortunatly, TVOne is another culprit as it gives the FPI airtime. Rojak People who try to push their own believes on other people by force are just fascists. There is no such thing as 'Äúthe true way'Äù. We are all people and even though we are the same, we are all different. Everyone differs on topics. It is diversity that makes a country civilized. If you want everyone to have exactly the same beliefs, buy an island and move there with your followers because you are not wanted here. The FPI is such a small organization, yet it has a big mouth. And its members like to resort to violence. A clear sign that they are intellectually challenged. The Indonesian population should show more unity against these groups and should not be afraid. Speak up against these people and soon we will be rid of these throwbacks from the middle ages. Anthony E What Munarman did is according to his religious insight as a Muslim. Umar bin Khatab undertook sweeping and war, based on the command of Allah to argue against evil and despotism. Lalan Good one there Munarman. It takes an abnormal approach to wage jihad in this doomed nation. Munarman'Äôs actions stem from the general public'Äôs ignorance of the need to uphold sharia law. The discussion is about stopping the spread of alcohol among the youths, in which Thamrin seemed to disagree, and he seemed to support the spread of sinful actions. So I do not blame Munarman for his reaction. Abu Jibril I saw part of the show today and here'Äôs what I saw. Munarman was in heated debate with the presenter as the 'Äúman of spill'Äù was arguing that the anti-alcohol movement is also happening in Papua (so what?). Thamrin kept silent, preferring to hear the 'Äúblurred lines'Äù in his head rather than Munarman'Äôs junk. Finally he said 'ÄúUh, actually,'Äù and Munarman waved his papers at him, stepped back and threw a drink at the sociologist like a diva (alright, he'Äôs a diva).

Clearly, Thamrin is the well-mannered gentleman here, and he is absolutely right to let us, the public, make a judgment call about the incident. What is more, Mr. Tamagola, in his wisdom, also allowed God to judge. Strong suspicions might rise among us as to whether Munarman is sufficiently endowed with intelligence that enables him to engage in a debate in a civilized way. I am beginning to seriously wonder whether the members of the FPI are actually real Muslims who have ever taken the trouble to look at 'Äî much less thoroughly study 'Äî the contents of the Koran. If they have ever studied the contents of that Holy Book, they should know that the Creator warned against crimes toward fellow humans. 'ÄúDon'Äôt ever diminish and lessen the rights of fellow humans, and do not create disaster on the face of the earth'Äù according to Verse As-Syuara 183.

The PPP proposal has received a second wind following the decision by the Supreme Court to abolish a 1997 presidential decree that had prevented local administrations from prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages.

Abu Jibril Smoking is worse that alcohol. Abdul Malik Alcohol is forbidden for Muslims, that is final.

"Sun, July 14, 2013",The week in review: Fasting amid price rises,"Hundreds of millions of Muslims began the annual fasting month earlier this week requiring them to refrain from consuming food and beverages from dawn until sunset. The small disagreement over when the lunar-based fasting month begins 'Äî members of Islamic organization Muhammadiyah started fasting on Tuesday, one day earlier than the beginning of Ramadhan as declared by the government and most other Islamic organizations 'Äî will not mar the virtues of the holy month. However, unlike last year, this year'Äôs fasting month will surely be much harder for the majority of Muslims because of the unusually high increases in the prices of most basic commodities and services as the impact of the recent fuel-price rise takes its toll. Indonesia, which has the world'Äôs largest Muslim population, usually sees prices rise immediately prior to and during Ramadhan and Idul Fitri but the recent fuel-price increase has pushed the inflationary pressures much further. While the fasting month requires Muslims to refrain from indulgence in bodily desires, the government appealed to suppliers and retailers not to excessively raise prices to offset the costlier fuel so as not to increase the burdens on the people during the fasting month and upcoming Idul Fitri celebrations. Meanwhile, State Intelligence Agency (BIN) chief Marciano Norman called on mass organizations not to conduct illegal raids on people and places they deem as acting immorally in order to maintain social harmony and peace. But Muslim hard-liners, affiliated with the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), have vowed to raid 'Äúsinful'Äù bars amid rising intolerance. FPI leaders were quoted by newspapers as asserting that they will take firm action against the sale of alcohol, strip shows and prostitution and would send members to spy on sinful activities, pointing out that they would not hesitate to conduct their own raids if the police failed to uphold the law and maintain public order properly. But Jakarta'Äôs public order agency (Satpol PP) urged hard-liners to refrain from taking the law into their own hands, promising to conduct sweeps of Jakarta, targeting the 1,800 establishments subject to Ramadhan regulations. Almost 900 bars, nightclubs, massage parlors, pachinko parlors and pool halls have said they will remain closed for the entire month. Without much fanfare, the House of Representatives enacted on Tuesday three pieces of legislation on the protection and empowerment of farmers and cattle breeders, the eradication of illegal logging and deforestation and aerospace management. The most significant of the new laws is the one which will require the government to provide agricultural insurance for farmers to cover losses caused by crop failure due to natural disasters, pests, outbreaks of infectious plant disease or severe weather. The law will also protect local farmers from excessive foreign competition by restricting farm commodity imports whenever local supplies are adequate to meet domestic demand and limiting imports only through specific seaports. The specific entry gateway ports for imports will be located far from the major producing areas of the imported commodities and will be equipped with quarantine facilities. Regional development banks are required by the law to set up departments specializing in extending microloans to farmers and cattle breeders. The law also obliges the central government to set up a commodity fund to support the building of buffer stocks of particular commodities in a concerted bid to protect farmers from excessive price volatility. In addition to the financial empowerment, the law also aims to give Indonesia'Äôs estimated 41 million farmers greater political voice and lobbying power by increasing government support for farmers'Äô associations and cooperatives. . The new law on the prevention and eradication of deforestation was billed as the most comprehensive legislation against all kinds of forest-related crimes. The House and government claimed that the new law would provide stronger legal foundations for law enforcers to cope with forestry crimes, and a deterrent effect to prevent new crimes. However, a coalition of environmental organizations and anticorruption activists has opposed the legislation, saying they will soon file for a judicial review of the law at the Constitutional Court. Most obviously missing from the new law, according to green campaigners, are provisions on forest fires and slash-and-burn practices of the type that caused more than two weeks of heavy haze in Riau, Singapore and Malaysia last month. The coalition of NGOs asserted that the new law seemed to be completely decoupled from prevailing forestry-related laws and regulations and did not make clear distinction between indigenous and state forests. The environmentalists claimed the new law instead added to the confusion of overlapping and conflicting regulations regarding forestry issues. The House saw the enactment of the law on aerospace management as an important move to strengthen the government control of satellites which are essential for data gathering, including those on taxpayers and tax objects.

The incident was sparked by FPI members conducting sweeps of several entertainment spots, and led to the death of one person and injuries to several others. Antara/Ediyanto July 20, p1 The hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) could be subject to sanctions stipulated in the 2013 Mass Organization Law (Ormas), following the clash between its members and residents of Sukorejo, Kendal, Central Java, on Thursday. As previously reported, a riot broke out in Sukorejo when residents tried to block members of the FPI Temanggung branch who were attempting to conduct a sweep in the village'Äôs red light district on account of Ramadhan. One resident was killed, while three others were injured during the clash. Your comments: Why should entertainment places be restricted? The whole concept of fasting is to restrict yourself from temptation (food, drink, sex, etc.), a combination of learning about self restraint, patience, personal reflection and having a greater understanding of the hardship of the lower class. I dare say that if you believe entertainment places are haram then don'Äôt go into one or if you go to a bar then order an ice tea. If your faith is weak and if a billiard place causes you to succumb to temptations, than perhaps a certain amount of introspection is needed in your hectic life? The police'Äôs job is to 'Äúserve and protect the citizens of Indonesia'Äù against lawlessness and uphold justice. They should crack down with the full force of the law on any terrorist and on any traitorous act by any group or individual. These Islamic fundamentalist groups want nothing more than power: The power to control and the power to destroy. When they don'Äôt get what they want they act in the usual manner, with violence. They shine an extremely violent and negative light on Islam, reinforcing the concept that Islam is the religion of war and totalitarianism, which isn'Äôt what most Muslims believe. Deddy K I agree with the idea that entertainment places should be restricted during the fasting month. However, the 'Äúsweeping'Äù process should be organized by the police, not mass organizations. The actions taken by Islamist fundamentalist groups are well known for hate crimes and violence, which are basically physical actions not based on the national law. Perhaps, the police could be more proactive in taking action against violations of national law in terms of activities during Ramadhan. With this, there are hopes of transforming the fundamentalist groups into solidarity groups without disbanding them, for the sake of democracy.

"Wed, July 24, 2013",Your letters: FPI plays victim,"This refers to an article entitled 'ÄúCentral Java Muslim clerics condemn FPI clashes with locals,'Äù (The Jakarta Post, July 22). The funny thing is that a representative from the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) claimed that the group was just monitoring and did not bring any weapons. But two members of the organization were found with weapons (who knows what would happened if the locals did not act immediately). Also who knows, maybe many of them actually brought weapons but the police covered it up). There are many flaws from FPI'Äôs side regarding this incident. The FPI also claimed that hundreds of bouncers from a brothel attacked them, not local residents. Logically, even a big-city brothel would not have that many bouncers, let alone a brothel in a small city. Furthermore, it was the FPI from Temanggung who clashed with the locals, not FPI members from Kendal. Why did the organization bring so many members if it is only 'Äúmonitoring'Äù ? The FPI is twisting the truth and is trying to act like the victim. And another thing that I find it funny is how the police reacted to this incident. They evacuated FPI members, while if it were the locals who were surrounded by the FPI, the police may have just stood around like they have done in the past.

"Wed, July 24, 2013","Commentary: The state, not the FPI, is the real problem","The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) came under another round of scathing attacks this week in the wake of the latest violence involving its members. Media news and commentaries, as well as social media, are buzzing with condemnations of the group over what happened in the Central Java town of Kendal last Thursday. There is now a growing chorus to disband the FPI, invoking the Mass Organization Law that gives the government such power. The law, passed by the House of Representatives this month, has yet to be signed into law by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Ironically, the same people who had opposed the passage of the law when it was deliberated in the House due to its draconian nature are also clamoring for the ban. But is the FPI the real culprit? We are treading a fine line between the need to protect freedom of association and freedom of expression on the one hand, and the need to protect citizens against violent acts perpetrated by groups like the FPI on the other. These rights are guaranteed by the constitution, which also states that the state is responsible for ensuring that those rights are upheld. Criticisms against the FPI, long notorious for its violent acts, have been misplaced. We are barking up the wrong tree. The FPI is not the real problem. The state is. Why is the FPI allowed to get away with these violent criminal acts in the first place, tormenting, harassing, injuring and at one time even killing its targets? Only a few of these incidents 'Äî we could count on one hand 'Äî ended up in court and jail. Now, as we saw what happened in Kendal on July 18, we are heading to a dangerous situation where violence is starting to beget violence. The local people, in a spontaneous move upon hearing that a woman was killed after an FPI car crashed into her during one of its sweeping operations against vice, went after the FPI members with equal violence. Fortunately, the heavily outnumbered FPI members found sanctuary in a mosque and were evacuated to safety only after police arrived to fetch them. The angry mob was waiting outside ready to inflict harm. Many people, as is clear from their comments in social media, cheered when the FPI finally got a taste of its own medicine: fear. They did not see the more serious implications of this. More people in the future will organize themselves into a mob to confront the FPI every time it goes out on a sweeping operation. Both sides will be armed for sure, and both would not back down. We can predict that there will be more clashes in the future. Where is the state, the police, in particular, in all this? This is the question that many people have repeatedly asked every time they hear of another report of FPI harassment or violent attacks against religious minorities, restaurant and bar owners, or just about anyone who has come under its wrath. The state has never been more impotent when it comes to dealing with the likes of the FPI. The FPI'Äôs right to exist should be protected, no matter how violent its ideology is. The danger with banning the FPI is that we know it will not be the last one to go, and that soon, organizations critical of the government will be muzzled this way. In the past, we have seen how the Mass Organization Law can become a powerful, repressive tool. Small organizations like the FPI thrive on media attention. The massive publicity makes them look a lot bigger than it is. The portrayal of the FPI as a violent or 'Äúanarchistic'Äù group by the media plays into its agenda, for it helps to instill fear in the public. Even the police are scared, apparently. As much as some people want to, we cannot ban any ideology. Like faith, people believe what they want to believe. But the state can do something each time these violent groups break the law. Not before. We should all be venting our anger at the state, in this case, Yudhoyono, the man who, for some strange reason, was in May conferred an international statesman award for promoting religious tolerance in Indonesia by the New York-based Appeal to Conscience Foundation. He has failed us. On Monday, amid all the social media buzz calling for the FPI ban, Yudhoyono said he would not tolerate acts of violence and instructed the police to do something about it. Mr. President, we have heard it before. Until we see real action on your part, we will not raise our hopes. The FPI also did not take Yudhoyono'Äôs remarks seriously. No sooner after he made it, FPI chairman Habib Rizieq came out with the most defiant statement, calling the president 'Äúa loser'Äù. Therefore, it looks like the violence will continue, but next time around, it may be worse. After Kendal, expect ugly clashes from what our bureaucrats like to call 'Äúhorizontal conflicts'Äù. Only Yudhoyono can put a stop to this. Unless he forgets, in the oath of office that he took in 2004 and in 2009, he pledged to uphold the constitution. That means protecting every citizen against acts of violence, by anyone, even those who claim to represent God. Yudhoyono is good until October 2014. Indonesia is already a failing state.

There would have been no room for the FPI to start its fires at will, as it used to do, had the police strictly enforced the law. In his message in response to the incident, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono 'Äî and perhaps many of us 'Äî identified a long-standing problem plaguing the police force when dealing with hard-line groups. This time around, the police should waste no time in taking actions against the FPI. For the umpteenth time, the FPI has spread fear despite its claim to fight moral decadence, as it easily resorts to violence and vandalism. As happened in Kendal, members of the FPI from another Central Java town of Temanggung raided a red light district on account of Ramadhan. A clash broke out as local residents resisted the sweep. A van carrying FPI members hit a group of teachers, killing one of them, as the hard-liners escaped the angry mass. The police have arrested three FPI members, including the van driver, but nobody has been held responsible for masterminding the raid. Investigators should go all out in searching for the 'Äúintellectual actor'Äù behind the Kendal incident and if necessary, those who agitated the FPI members to commit violence in the name of God. FPI leaders have openly called for the use of violence, citing the police'Äôs inaction against prostitution, distribution of alcoholic beverages and other practices they deem as sinful, including homosexuality and adherence to Ahmadiyah beliefs. The question should be raised, however, as to why the FPI does not act against the rampant sex and drug trade in a certain part of Jakarta. It is the FPI'Äôs acts of thuggery that matter because they endanger civilization. That it has refused to give up its violent campaign indicates that the law is not strictly upheld or there is a degree of omission by the state 'Äî and hence offers no deterrence. What deterrence could we expect if 12 FPI supporters only received between three and six months in jail for butchering three Ahmadiyah followers in Banten in 2011, or a suspended FPI leader in Bekasi was sentenced to only five and a half months'Äô imprisonment for attacking a church minister and congregation member earlier that year? Now that the President has 'Äî in an unprecedented move 'Äî asked for a zero tolerance attitude to be taken against violent groups like the FPI, the law enforcers should have no more reason to offer leniency by, among other things, handing down maximum sentences. A failure to get tough on these radicals will only encourage other groups to follow suit. Disbanding hard-line groups, which is now possible thanks to the passage of the controversial Mass Organization Law, is neither effective nor democratic. The draconian move will only exacerbate radicalization or catapult hard-line groups to martyrdom and fame as victims of a perceived tyrannical state.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/07/24/editorial-thugs-are-not-martyrs.html,,2013
"Thu, July 25, 2013",Your letters: Take tough action against hardliners,"The media has published many articles describing how the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) has ransacked and destroyed cafe'Äôs, restaurants, shops, entertainment establishments and places of worship. The only people that have the guts to fight these criminals are the Dayaks of Kalimantan 'Äî who last year threatened members of the FPI in Palangkaraya. Then in the city of Kendal, Central Java, the owners of a restaurant fought the FPI vigilantes, but unfortunately, this incident resulted in the death of a woman and left many severely injured. This case is still being investigated by the authorities who did not do anything to protect the citizens. After the latest criminal act committed by the FPI in Makassar, the Makassar Police finally took action by arresting the leaders of the FPI mob who ransacked and destroyed a store that sold liquor. The FPI forgets that the owners of these establishments work hard and pay taxes. They employ thousands of people who need jobs. The FPI does not do anything productive for our nation. President Yudhoyono should return the award he received in the US.   It is time for the President to take action rather than just providing lip-service. The authorities of this nation have done nothing, thus, far to incriminate these vigilantes. Thumbs up to the Makassar Police, who arrested members of the FPI in South Sulawesi. If the police in all 33 provinces of Indonesia show guts and take action against the FPI like the Makassar Police, the FPI will eventually disappear. Lynna van der Zee-Oehmke Bogor, West Java The inevitable impact of this chaos is that people will easily generalize that all Muslims are exactly like the FPI and blame Islam. Please keep in mind that no single verse of the Koran teaches us to impose any coercive action against those who deviate. I don'Äôt know why the FPI commits all these violent acts. Well, I understand that violence usually happens when people grow desperate and their government can'Äôt enforce laws effectively.

"Fri, July 26, 2013",Issue of the day: Clerics condemn FPI clashes with locals,"July 22, Online A group of Muslim clerics from various regions in Central Java have condemned a series of sweeps conducted by the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) in several regions, such as those in Sukorharjo and Kendal regencies last week that led to clashes with locals. 'ÄúDon'Äôt take over the police'Äôs duty to tackle crime,'Äù head of Mashitoh Islamic Boarding School Nasir Azhari said on Monday. Another cleric, Tamam Qoulani of the Al Hikmah Al Islamiyah added that he had rejected the idea of establishing FPI in Salatiga for exactly those reasons. Your comments: Welcome Ramadhan, the holy month of fasting. The FPI members, who this week killed someone, injured 3, vandalized someone'Äôs business and called the President a 'Äúloser'Äù, are part of the same group that claims to be the true voice of Islam, yet this group just broke all the rules of fasting. Acts or thoughts of violence during this holy time is considered haram and will nullify your fast. These guys are so wrapped up in controlling what everyone else does that they forget to carry out their own religious duties. They need to be disbanded. 'ÄúIndonesia, the most tolerant country'Äù, yeah right! Insanctus These Muslim clerics must have been fast asleep for the past 10 years during which the scoundrels of the FPI have performed heavy-handed police duties with impunity by and under the nose of those who are mandated to uphold the law of the land. In any case, I hope that more people/religious organizations stand up and speak out against the misdeeds of the FPI. It is high time the authorities realize that they cannot keep condoning what is happening under the name of religion in our country. Henry Manoe Dear brothers and sisters, Islam has taken a firm and decisive stance against zina (fornication or adultery). Islam not only prohibits zina but also closes all the avenues and means leading to it. This is achieved by prohibiting every step and means leading to stimulating desires, opening ways for illicit sexual relations between men and women, and promoting indecency and obscenity. So why do we have to be so mean to the FPI? They'Äôre just doing their holy and upright job as God'Äôs warriors. Abu Jibril Then why don'Äôt they do it through legal means? They are supposed to follow the law of the land just like anyone else and not cause problems in the community. Is this how they treat their families at home as well? If they don'Äôt follow their rules, do they threaten to beat or kill them? Is this the way that Prophet Muhammad did it? You say that you follow Islam: The parts that you want to, or in its entirety? If you follow Islam in its entirety, then you wouldn'Äôt be doing what you are doing. Also what makes you think that the sin of adultery is looked at as a major sin in Islam? It is also viewed as a major sin in Christianity, Judaism and under Mosaic Law. Yet Allah has given people free will to follow: Either the right way or the wrong way. Human beings, no matter who we are, are accountable either in this life or the next. What the FPI, these so-called holy warriors, are doing is chasing people away from Islam and not toward it. So before you try to straighten other people out, straighten yourself out first because in Islam that is the best jihad you can do. Frank Musiol I do hope that more Islamic Clerics denounce the presence of FPI in Indonesia and all those that support them. I hope these clerics are not just throwing what they deem the 'Äúweak'Äù to the curb to further radical ideas. Clerics should teach tolerance and some basic understanding of the similarities between different religions. They should even teach that Islamic minorities are OK.

"Sun, July 28, 2013",The week in review: Baby and Blues,"The images that sparked the most smiles this week were surely that of England'Äôs Prince George Alexander Louis, as the newborn has been named, following his introduction to the world by his parents, Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge. But at home, amid the excitement greeting 'ÄúThe Blues'Äù, the Chelsea team members who were in town for a third friendly match, there were also images of the boys and girls lucky enough to participate in the coaching clinic. Surely, a cure to 'Äúsave our soccer'Äù lies somewhere in future generations. A young soccer fan, Muhammad Firman, 14, of Semarang, Central Java, returned to home soil on Monday with the title of Most Valuable Player from the world youth soccer tournament, the Gothia Cup in Gothenburg, Sweden. Firman, along with his teammates, brought home national pride, as runner-ups in the tournament 'Äî a little covered event that could douse disappointment from the loss of 8-1 to Chelsea on Thursday night. Though spectators were expecting a great time watching the British teams rather than an Indonesian victory, our players surprisingly only lost 2-0 to Liverpool last week following the initial humiliating 7-0 loss to Arsenal. On National Children'Äôs Day, the recognition of inspiring children and the fate of their less lucky peers seemed to have stood in the background. At the national event on July 23, children sang a new composition by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono while Ani Yudhoyono was awarded for having established 339 'Äúsmart houses'Äù, which are free education facilities with free books and computers. Hopefully at least, the government follows up on its campaign on the role of families in nurturing children. The many reports on children this year included youngsters fending for themselves and their younger siblings, as parents were busy working elsewhere. Even in their homes, a number of girls have been raped and murdered, some by family members. Children were among passengers in the latest accident at sea. At least eight passengers died when a boat with some 200 men, women and children sank off the coast of Cianjur regency in West Java on Tuesday night. Yet people seeking safety from persecution, or simply better lives for their families, will continue to pass Indonesia despite the hundreds of deaths reported in recent years from such tragedies. Various hardships would have driven the latest passengers from their homes in Bahrain, Bangladesh, Iran, Iraq and Sri Lanka, which is why Australia'Äôs efforts to discourage asylum-seekers will be largely futile. Indonesia is equally responsible for such deaths as our rampant corruption allows many to profit from the lucrative people trafficking business. At least we have now earned further recognition for efforts made in the war on graft. The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) is this year'Äôs recipient of the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay award, for its tireless antigraft campaign. The award, announced on Wednesday, should boost the energy of the KPK, hounded left and right by the resistance of corrupt parties. Ending chronic corruption even on a low-scale is a 'Äúmission impossible'Äù. So Jakartans are watching with bated breath how Governor Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo and his sharp tongued Deputy Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama are dealing with street vendors around the infamously congested Tanah Abang market. As one vendor pays Rp 1 million (US$97.15) a month for his space on the road, excluding daily fees, naturally all are crying injustice against attempts to remove them from the streets. If Jokowi'Äôs approach with vendors, thugs and all officials fail, we will have yet another testimony of resistance against the antigraft movement. * * * The state'Äôs firmness on crime, apart from graft, is among obstacles to legal certainty. But many have forgotten this amid the outrage against the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), whose members raided areas of 'Äúvice'Äù in Kendal, Central Java. A confrontation with locals on Thursday ended in a crash in which a vehicle reportedly carrying FPI members killed a pregnant woman. The public demanded the government disband the group with the renewed Mass Organization Law. The President issued a rare warning that violence in the name of Islam cannot be tolerated 'Äî yet officials instantly backed off, saying that since FPI was not registered, it could not be disbanded. However, the law should have never been revived. The past regime used it against any organization it saw fit. If police consistently arrest anyone taking the law into their own hands, law enforcers would no longer be shameless witnesses to violence in the name of God. Still, the outrage signaled wide disapproval of stopping vice with violence 'Äî including from Muslims trying their best during this fasting month. Meanwhile, work on transportation infrastructure is being rushed as the Idul Fitri holiday approaches. Those having to pass through Soekarno-Hatta International Airport will envy travelers going through Medan'Äôs new Kuala Namu Airport 'Äî the country'Äôs first airport linked to the city by rail. In the capital, amid worries over the rupiah and soaring prices, people will smile when they are finally able to walk on sidewalks free of merchandise, muck and motorcycles 'Äî and not only in Tanah Abang.

Members of the public, ranging from prominent local clerics to young netizens, deplored the clash between members of FPI Temanggung branch and locals of Sukorejo in Kendal that killed a resident and injured three others. The riot broke out following the FPI'Äôs attempts to conduct a sweep in the village'Äôs red-light area last Thursday. Your comments: The FPI should stop, look around and count its support if it is seriously thinking of its future.

Julius Pangestu These hard-liners are modern khawarij. They misinterpret the Koran and sunna to justify their wrong actions. They think they know it all and go against the Muslims. They don'Äôt accept any evidence that does not suit their desires. For them, killing Muslims is permissible. Ibn Umar considered the khawarij and the heretics as the worst beings in creation and he said: They went to verses that were said about the disbelievers and applied them to the believers. This is a hall mark of the khawarij, who use Koranic verses about unbelievers and apply them to Muslims. Yudas Gurion I equate the whole sorry business with the event in the Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili in 1991. That was the beginning of the end for Indonesia'Äôs occupation of East Timor. Sometime, somewhere, people will cry 'Äúenough'Äù when it comes to the antics of the FPI.

By the next decade or administration, people like them will gather under a different name. They have always been like that since independence, the Soeharto era (when he was a Kejawen and a Muslim), the reformasi era and now today. We need to defeat Islamic radicalism in the long term. It needs bigger actions than simply disbanding the FPI, but of course, judging by the history of Indonesia (and other Muslim-majority republics), hoping for a nation where religion and ethnicity do not matter is almost impossible.

"Fri, August 23, 2013",Commentary: Neither JIL nor FPI: The power of ordinary Muslims,"Does Islam, 15 years after the fall of the New Order, remain a powerful force in Indonesian politics? It is safe to say that political Islam is weakening, but the faith itself, as it appears, still plays an influential role on the political stage. There are plenty of cases in which the secular parties use anti-Shia/Ahmadiyah sentiments to lure Muslim voters, who either call for or condone what appears to be a state-sponsored inquisition against the 'Äúheretics'Äù. With the latest Pew survey showing that 73 percent of Indonesian Muslims support Sharia law, we are perhaps justified to suspect that politicians, aware of declining public trust in them, are set to sell sharia during elections. We are thus facing our worst nightmare: The unholy alliance of political corruption and Islamic extremism. As the world'Äôs most populous Muslim country, Islam, whether you like it or not, will remain a significant part of the Indonesian people'Äôs political life. The question is: Will it continue to be a pebble in the shoe for our seemingly fragile democracy? Will it pose a perennial threat to our civil liberties? The problem with Islam is that some Muslims believe their faith is detrimental to democracy. These Muslims, presumably small in number but extremely noisy thanks largely to media sensationalism, will continue to undermine our democratic values. Indonesia'Äôs future very much depends on how we contain their influence, and seeing the news lately, we are not doing very well. For decades, we rely on Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the country'Äôs two largest Muslim organizations, to nurture tolerance among Muslims. But the two groups have been losing ground to the radicals in the fight for influence. In certain cases, the two groups even ended up being complicit in acts of intolerance themselves. This is hardly surprising. As leaders of Muhammadiyah and NU became more political after reformasi, the two have, according to analysts, become less influential socially and culturally. We then pin our hope on the Liberal Islam Networks (JIL), co-founded by Muslim scholar and Democratic Party politician Ulil Abshar Abdalla. In recent years, JIL has been seen as the antithesis of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), which is widely seen as the face of Islamic intolerance in Indonesia. But the two are basically two sides of the same coin. They promote the same Islamic scripturalism (JIL may deny this accusation) to justify their beliefs, be they religious pluralism or religious fascism. While JIL was established to counter the radical interpretation of Islamic scriptures, the aggressive, if not offensive, liberal Islam campaigns they launched have inadvertently fueled Islamic radicalism. It does not help that JIL activists are seen as 'Äúelitist intellectuals'Äù who often speak in an elusive and confusing language just to provoke public discussion, which sadly has often only produced derision against them. As debates on religion always end up in circular arguments, I am doubtful we are able to curb the budding radicalism by simply offering friendlier and more democratic interpretations of Islam. I believe the reason why political Islam is not selling well in the country is that most Indonesian Muslims are basically practicing their religion nominally. They are the backbone of Indonesia'Äôs secularism. The majority of Indonesian Muslims, in my view, do not need scriptural justification to embrace democracy. They just do not take political Islam seriously. These groups do not identify themselves with JIL or FPI. In urban areas where social media culture is burgeoning, they could be identified by their derision toward FPI and cynicism toward JIL. They practice Islamic rituals without delving too much into the technicalities over how women should dress or whether the creation of an Islamic state is a must. But they are often forgotten in the country'Äôs political discourse, derided by foreign observers for their silence on the rising intolerance and seen by Muslim scholars as prey to radical ideology. In fact, they were the ones who prevented the Islamists from holding power in the country after Soeharto'Äôs downfall, sparing us from experiencing what Egypt is experiencing today. I am not saying Indonesians are 'Äúgood'Äù or 'Äúbad'Äù Muslims. I just want to highlight the fact that most Indonesians are apathetic to political Islam and that the country'Äôs future will not be determined by who will prevail in the ideological battle between radical and liberal Muslims. What matters the most is to ensure that democracy really works for us, that it could bring prosperity to the majority of Indonesians, regardless of their beliefs. That said, our enemy number one is not the radical, who is politically weak, but the power-hungry politicians who have empowered the former to further the latter'Äôs political agendas. The answer to what appears to be politically driven intolerance in Indonesia is not more campaigns for peaceful Islam, but political reform and our ability to elect true statesmen as our leaders. At the end of the day, what the people really want is justice and prosperity. Debates over who is right about Islam 'Äî Sunni or Shia, liberal or conservative 'Äî are irrelevant.

"Wed, September 4, 2013",Text your say: Miss World controversy,"Your comments on Bali Governor Made Mangku Pastika, who says theMiss World beauty pageant will go ahead as planned on the tourist islandin September despite protests 'Äî and threats 'Äî from a number ofhard-line groups: Foundations or any other non-profit organizations need funding from one source or another. I suspect the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) generates its cash through these so called protests. Being an extremist group could potentially attract lots of sympathy and off-the-scene support, some with political or economic agendas, not to mention the wealth involved. Now think about that for a second, didn'Äôt FPI successfully divert a few national topics? They always manage to find the best of times to grab headlines or am I being paranoid? Either way, one can only help but wonder at their true intention. Regarding beauty pageants, this is the time for women to be given equal rights, equal opportunities and not only to be regarded as trophies; nothing more than their physical attraction. The purpose of the pageant is to show that women have much to offer, not just their beauty, and be given liberty to advance. This, in my opinion, is more important and is the true message of the pageant! Bagus P Not good. What is the lesson from this Miss World? What will Indonesian women learn from the event? Wasting more time on fashion, wasting their money. The models cannot become their icons. Freedom is not simply doing as you wish. Freedom is controlling yourself, choosing which is good and which is bad. Miz The FPI should realize that Indonesia is a multicultural, multireligious, multiethnic and multilingual country. People have different religions, traditions, languages and ethnicities. Thank God this is a democratic country where all people have the same rights. The FPI want to go back to the Middle Ages and I am sure their wives and daughters have different opinions. These ignorant morons should realize that several Muslim-majority countries participate in the Miss World and Miss Universe pageants and yes these young and beautiful ladies wear bikinis and low-cut evening gowns. Algeria, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon produce excellent wines and liquor (Algerian wine has a special place in my heart). Please pay attention FPI, many young and beautiful ladies from many other Muslim countries represent their respective countries and assist their governments promote the existence and beautiful sights and sounds of their countries of origin. I have lived in a number of countries on four different continents and practically nobody knows where Indonesia is and in lots of cases people think that Bali is part of Brazil. Thanks to the island of Bali, and Komodo, people now know more about Indonesia and where it is located.

"Fri, September 20, 2013",Issue of the day: FPI seeks to cross over to Bali,"Sept. 14, Online Around 100 members of hard-line group Islam Defenders Front (FPI) massed in Ketapang Port in Banyuwangi, East Java, on Saturday, seeking to cross over to Bali Island to disperse the 2013 Miss World pageant. The group walked to Katapang from Banyuwangi Baru station, which is located 100 meters from the port. However, they were blocked by hundreds of Mobile Brigade (Brimob) officers who were on standby at the main gate of the port. Currently, the FPI members are negotiating with the Brimob officers to try to make their way into the port, tempo.co reported on Saturday. Your comments: There is never a dull moment in Indonesia when it comes down to Islamic radicals. Indonesia would do better without corruption and if everyone had the same level of education. It could produce great technology instead of creating religious egoistical nonsense. It is embarrassing when the country cannot deal with religious bigots. Moon River The organizers'Äô words are a clear indication of intent for violence, which I think we have laws in place against this, and can constitute a violation of even our laws on terror. Perhaps it could be considered an act of treason as Bali is a part of Indonesia and therefore this statement from a registered member of FPI could be considered a statement of war (or intent to attack). I think acts of treasons are punishable by death and the organization would be blacklisted from Indonesia. Considering the government passed the mass organization bill, they haven'Äôt used it for its primary purpose, which is to destroy violent groups. But then for years, the FPI and other radical organizations have been screaming for death and destruction to the deafening silence of the police and the government. This is sad as all this emboldens them till they do something. Good on the East Java Police for upholding common sense, denying them a permit to voice their intent against a licensed event.  It is sad that the Jakarta Police and the National Police are not on par with them. Deddy K Worldwide reporters are already in Bali, I never read anything about the FPI in international papers. Good press coverage might shake up the government a bit and cause a reaction to change things react. Peter Verduin It sounds like planned acts of terror, maybe they should be let in to be 'Äúquestioned on arrival'Äù by the National Police'Äôs counterterrorism unit, Densus 88. Sutek I believe all entrances to Bali, including ferry ports and airport, have been closely guarded by Balinese volunteers and there is no way the FPI can get through unless they launch an amphibious operation to Kuta beach from the open sea. For this purpose, they must learn from General Douglas McArthur, the master of island fighting during World War II. Robby Kaware I'Äôm jealous of the FPI! I have to work everyday and I spend my spare time with family and friends, meanwhile they stick their noses in other peoples business. Get a life FPI! Be productive!

"Sat, October 19, 2013",Issue of the day: Residents challenge mayor over church permit,"Oct. 18, p2 Residents of Jatisampurna subdistrict, Jatisampurna district, had filed a lawsuit against Bekasi Mayor Rahmat Effendi for issuing a building permit for the construction of the St. Stanislaus Kostka Catholic church in the Kranggan area. The lawsuit was read by presiding judge Edi Firmansyah in a court hearing at the Bandung State Administrative Court on Thursday. The plaintiffs urged the judges to suspend the church'Äôs construction as the permit was still being processed in court. They also urged the panel of judges to order the mayor to revoke the permit. The lawyer for the plaintiffs, Achmad Ardiansyah from the Indonesian Muslim Legal Aid Institute, expressed hope the judges would grant the petition. Your comments: All religions teach tolerance and peace. Islam (in my opinion) is the only one I see in Indonesia that doesn'Äôt practice it. Because government is incompetent to govern its people, it leaves permit issues to people with the expectation it can naturally find a way out while the constitution guarantees the right that every single citizen is free to practice their religion including having a place to worship. Ucok This is a very sad thing for both Indonesia and its people. Supposedly under the democratic rule we retain the basic right to choose our own religion, providing it doesn'Äôt endanger the safety and security of others. Effectively this should not be about Islam and Christianity at all, but simply to allow the people their basic right to freedom of choice. Given the clarity of this situation, the applicants should lose their case, be forced by the courts to pay all the church'Äôs legal and court costs, plus any reasonable out of pocket expenses. In this instance, I am sure the church would be able to seek their resolve and compensate using the law by way of 'Äúliquidator damages'Äù however, in saying that, I am sure the church'Äôs position would simply be to seek a quiet and peaceful resolution and get on with their project digressed from becoming involved in childish practices which is exactly what the plaintiff is doing here. Whatever happened to 'Äúlive and let live'Äù and try to live in peace and harmony with respect for each other and their beliefs? Bay I guess it wouldn'Äôt be too surprising to find 'Äúirregularities'Äù such as 'Äúoffering residents food and gifts'Äù to 'Äúpromote inter-religious harmony'Äù at the community level. What I don'Äôt understand is, given that such 'Äúirregularities'Äù are pretty much a 'Äúregular occurrence'Äù in Indonesian politics, wouldn'Äôt targeting your opponents'Äô 'Äúmisconducts'Äù encourage them to use the same tactic against you? Are we going to see religious minorities using legal instruments to obstruct mosque building permits? I am pretty sure that they also have their ways of sweetening their deals. Magpie Interesting, the lawyer is from an organization that protects the FPI and other organizations. Interesting that as per usual the radical Muslims fear and cower at buildings and other religions.  If it wasn'Äôt so sad it would be amusing. Deddy K I'Äôm not blaming all Muslims but I'Äôm sorry guys, you are as much to blame for sitting and hiding while these mad men are allowed to run rampant.

"Mon, November 4, 2013",Commentary: Muscle testing of bullies amid dangerous state silence,"Joyful images of Yogyakarta'Äôs royal wedding are fading away, its celebration of traditions now in the background. We are back to the reality that any city is a testing ground for primitive, dangerous old instincts. Earlier, several groups in Yogyakarta defended members of the Army'Äôs Special Forces (Kopassus) who killed alleged thugs detained by the police on March 23, suggesting that the soldiers were heroes in the fight against thugs. Witnesses, families of the victims as well as officials from the National Commission of Human Rights (Komnas HAM) were intimidated and harassed. The military was quick to claim the elite soldiers acted out of corps solidarity, while other criminals behind bars wondered who would be next on the army'Äôs list of targets of vengeance. So much for military reform. Then on Sunday, a gathering of the relatives of victims of the 1965 purge of communists was dispersed by anti-communists in Sleman, Yogyakarta. On last Monday, the relatives reported the incident to the city'Äôs legal aid office, where they were again met by the Yogyakarta chapter of the Indonesian Anti-Communist Front (FAKI), and the Youth Forum for the Family of Indonesian Veterans and Police and Military Retirees (GM-FKPPI). The groups threatened the legal aid office (LBH Yogyakarta) for assisting those reporting on Sunday'Äôs incident, during which at least three were injured. FAKI leader Burhanuddin ZR said they would attack the LBH office, even claiming that he was among the executors of the 1965 purge. It was not clear whether he was promoting himself for a possible sequel of the film The Act of Killing, the documentary on a self-proclaimed former killer of many suspected communists in Medan, North Sumatra. A member of the national human rights body, Roichatul Aswidah, aptly observed that the groups were confident when confronting the victims'Äô families because 'Äúelements of the state 'Äî including the government 'Äî were reluctant to change and reconstruct the way society treats the ex-PKI [Indonesian Communist Party] members and their families.'Äù This is why the provincial police statement in which they said that no violence nor intimidation took place against the gathering of some 40 people on Sunday, is irrelevant, if not wrong. What is recurring is the blessing of the bullies through the absence of law enforcement action against those who are flexing their muscles again in sporadic, but continuous efforts to uphold their version of what is right and wrong. What is right, said the FAKI leader, was that 'ÄúIt is legal for us to kill [victims'Äô families], just like when we killed members of the PKI in the past.'Äù In the United States or Singapore, he might have been immediately picked up by police. But in Indonesia, many, if not all, enjoy unlimited freedom of speech despite the Criminal Code, which penalizes the spreading of hatred, as the above statement could be understood. As Roichatul suggested, the groups were riding on the absence of clear signs from the state to end stigmatization against any group of citizens, in this case the families of the targets of the 1960s witch hunt. Home Affairs Minister Gamawan Fauzi is among the officials under fire for stating last week that another group of vigilantes, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), was a national asset, while prosecutors are seeking seven-month prison sentences for two FPI members charged with involvement in a deadly clash with villagers in Kendal regency, Central Java, in July. FPI members also got away with light sentences in the attack and killing of three Ahmadiyah followers in Banten in February 2011. The minister had suggested that the FPI be involved in 'Äúcommunity development'Äù including organizing religious holidays. 'ÄúAll this time we'Äôve painted a picture that [the FPI] is bad. What if we involved them in community development programs?'Äù he said, adding that it would be better to involve the FPI in organizing events on religious holidays. 'ÄúThe principle of modern society and governance is to involve uncooperative mass organizations or NGOs in development. That'Äôs civil society,'Äù he said. 'ÄúIf we work together with them, there won'Äôt be two camps attacking one another.'Äù Minister Gamawan seemed oblivious to the fact that both religious festivals held by the Jakarta administration on the eve of Idul Adha in mid-October as well as the street festival on New Year'Äôs Eve, also held by the administration, had brought a revived sense of relief that Jakarta belonged to everyone, free of roaming gangs ruling through intimidation and violence. These incidents remind us that the state still likes to play safe and protect bullies, both those abusing religion and narrow 'Äúpatriotic'Äù sentiment, instead of reasserting that the state protects all citizens'Äô equal rights. Our hopes for a better, humane, nation rest with local leaders 'Äî Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo and his deputy, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, have thwarted suggestions to replace a subdistrict head just because of protests due to her Christian faith, while Palu mayor in Central Sulawesi, Rusdy Mastura, has reached out to former victims of the 1965 witch hunt, offering free healthcare apart from apologies for what they experienced, though he was only a boy scout at the time, guarding suspected communist detainees. On a national scale, without a clear stance from at least the police on what constitutes law and order, one has slim hopes for improvements under new National Police Chief Gen. Sutarman.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/11/04/commentary-muscle-testing-bullies-amid-dangerous-state-silence.html,,2013
"Fri, November 8, 2013",Of dim sum and wines made in Hong Kong,"Think local: Grapes from aboard are pressed, fermented and aged at The 8th Estate Winery in Hong Kong. (JP/Pandaya) Among world travelers 'Äî from the backpackers to the big spenders 'Äî Hong Kong is famous as a haven for wining and dining, offering everything from unpretentious roadside cafes to award-winning upscale establishments. Recently, we started a culinary tour by exploring the late-night noodle haunt of Wan Chai, where foodies can find small family food stalls that are open well past midnight, as well as international franchises and small Chinese restaurants that offer a wide choice of Cantonese cuisine featuring dishes that they claim are original. Wan Chai, one of the first settlement areas in Hong Kong, is where the elite once concentrated on hills overlooking the sea. It remains a good place to hang out and have a late supper in the small restaurants lining the streets. Menus are dominated by noodles that are served with fish, beef or pork in endless variations. Since few patrons were on hand during our visit, the food we ordered came fast and steaming 'Äî offering us a good way to stay awake despite the odd hour. The next day, we were delighted when our guide told us that we would have lunch at the city'Äôs top dim sum restaurant after a visit to Comix Home Base. For Chinese food lovers, dim sum is a delicacy never to be missed 'Äî especially when you are in its native land, Hong Kong. In Jakarta, dim sum, which literally means 'Äútouch the heart'Äù, is usually served as a snack as the name suggests. In Hong Kong, however, a greater variety of savory dumplings are also served 'Äî as a main course and the portions are larger. Our quest for dumplings took us to Cuisine Cuisine, a Cantonese restaurant on the 3/F floor of The Mira Hong Kong on Nathan Road. It is an upscale restaurant that received one star from Michelin. Dim sum is its signature dish. In case you are not familiar with the term 'ÄúMichelin star'Äù, you can be forgiven, as it is rarely heard in Indonesia. For those in the know, however, a Michelin star is a hallmark for fine dining. Started by the famed French tire maker in 1926, the Michelin system awards from zero to three stars based on the comments of anonymous reviewers who focus on quality, mastery of technique, personality and consistency of the food. Interior and decor do not count. Presenting itself as a showcase of Cantonese dining traditions, Cuisine cuisine boasts cozy and modern interior with exclusive rooms for more private dining. There is also a nice view of Kowloon Park. The large variety of the yummy dumplings that kept appearing on our table explained why dim sum is so much more than a snack. On the menu were 20 all-you-can-eat Cantonese dim sum selections for HK$248 (Rp 360,000), including steamed shrimp dumplings and steamed minced chicken and shrimp dumplings with crab roe. You might also try steamed 'ÄúXao Long Bao'Äù Shanghai-style pork soup dumplings or more contemporary creations, such as taro puffs with diced chicken and foie gras. At the end of the lunch, when most of the diners at the table had already given up and leaned back, master chef Ringo Wong appeared to share his experience and expertise 'Äî as well as to apologize for not fulfilling a promise to take us to his kitchen. 'ÄúIt was not possible, because our high standard of hygiene doesn'Äôt allow visitors,'Äù Ringo said through an interpreter. In its search for top-quality authentic Cantonese fare, Cuisine cuisine'Äôs master chefs never stop seeking original recipes and invent new unique ingredients, he added. For wine lovers, Hong Kong has a sweet-and-sour surprise. The arid, hilly territory, which has little arable land and no vineyards, now has its own The 8th Estate Winery. After cruising and asking around for directions, we eventually arrived at the third floor of an old industrial building at Ap Lei Chau, where Lysanne Tusar, the winery'Äôs founding director, was waiting for a tasting session of locally made wines in a bar filled with oak barrels. With an annual production capacity of 40,000 bottles, the winery opened to the public in December 2008, offering red, white and dessert varietals. Most of its products are ready for sale. It aims to boost annual production to 100,000 bottles for individual customers. Patrons visiting the establishment might wonder how on earth can The 8th Estate make wine in a crowded cosmopolitan city. Tusar explained that the establishment sources grapes from the US, Europe and Australia. Its people go to the grape-growing countries to assess the fruit'Äôs quality and harvest. They freeze the produce and ship it back to The 8th Estate, where it is pressed, fermented, bottled and aged in the tall building that stands next to a high hill. 'ÄúFor our 2007s, we got our grapes from Washington state [in the US], as we thought it was a good year,'Äù Tusar says. The 8th Estate sells not only the conventional finished products but also offers customized wines. Following the direction of professional winemakers, customers can prepare their own concoctions from the varietals sold by the barrel. This is only for serious wine lovers, however. A single barrel that can yield 280 bottles costs at least HK$66,000. To quench our curiosity, Tusar uncorked several 2007 bottles of Sauvignon Blanc and a less sweet Chardonnay. The winery was established in February 2008, making the best of a government'Äôs policy to slash tariffs on imported wine to 40 percent from 80 percent in 2007. Business started booming in 2008 after Hong Kong eliminated the duties altogether 'Äî a policy intended to support the territory'Äôs ambition to become Asia'Äôs wine distribution hub. Hong Kong trade officials estimate that the wine market in Asia will grow by up to 20 percent a year, reaching US$27 billion by 2017. The 8th Estate has been growing in popularity and its bottles are currently stocked in Hong Kong'Äôs Michelin-star establishments, side by side with globally established vintages such as Bordeaux, Lindeman and Hardy'Äôs. The 8th Estate Winery shows how Hong Kong'Äôs ambitions to become a wine distribution hub have spurred a flourishing wine scene. Auction houses hold multi-million-dollar sales, while neighborhood wine shops have sprung up, along with wine exhibitions and tastings. When in Hong Kong, you can order a bottle of wine for an affordable price for the perfect complement to your dinner, rather than as a marker of social status. By the way, please go ahead and indulge: There is no branch office of the FPI in Hong Kong.

Imam Bonjol, shown before the 2004 tsunami forced its closure. The building has since reopened, although not as a movie theater. (Courtesy of Ian Photoworks) In Aceh capital Banda Aceh, movie theaters closed after the western Indonesian city was struck by a tsunami in 2004. The province has since been rebuilt and gained autonomy from the central government, as well as ended a decades-long separatist insurgency and introduced sharia, which led to movie screens going dark in Aceh for the last decade. While no permits to reopen movie theaters have been issued, officials remain quiet and have not officially banned theaters either. As Banda Aceh Mayor Illiza Sa'Äôaduddin Djamal says: 'ÄúWe are not in the position to decide. It'Äôs up to the MPU (Ulema Consultative Assembly)'Äù. Meanwhile, Karim Syeikh, the head of the Banda Aceh chapter of the MPU, said he never heard of the several petitions to reopen Aceh'Äôs cinemas. 'ÄúLocal movie theaters stopped operation some time prior to the introduction of Sharia. But people have now their own television sets at home 'Äî they don'Äôt need any kind of public theaters,'Äù he says. 'ÄúAny enterprise that hinders the implementation of sharia would not be authorized.'Äù Once proud: Banda Aceh'Äôs Garuda Theater on Jl. Imam Bonjol, shown before the 2004 tsunami forced its closure. The building has since reopened, although not as a movie theater. (Courtesy of Harun Keuchik Leumik) Banda Aceh Sharia agency chief Syahrizal Abbas expressed a different opinion to members of the Indonesian Censorship Board on June 19, claiming the local government has never opposed the business. 'ÄúInvestors might have different concerns 'Äî they are not confident enough,'Äù Syahrizal said. 'ÄúIf cinema can contribute to national character-building, there is thus no reason for the Acehnese government to oppose movie theaters.'Äù Part of the hesitance about reopening movie theaters in Banda Aceh stems from memories of now-defunct bioskop mesum, literally dirty cinemas. Once locally owned and operated first-run cinemas, the theaters turned into grindhouses, showing grade-B action movies and sexploitation films as well as old Hong Kong martial arts films from the 1980s or 1970s. Also on the marquee were softcore erotic films, some made in Indonesia, known locally as esek-esek. The theaters were often not air conditioned, featured unpadded seats and screened decades-old 35mm film prints that were full of splices and emulsion lines. Ticket prices rarely exceeded Rp 5,000 (43 US cents), attracting a humble audience of wong cilik (common people), teenagers on dates and children with nothing to do after school. 'ÄúRoughly 70 percent were international films, mostly old American and a number of esek-esek [semi-pornographic] films; the rest, 30 percent were Indonesian productions,'Äù said Ferry Gelluny, recalling the movies at Banda Aceh'Äôs now-defunct grindhouse Gadjah XXI, which illicitly appropriated the name of the nation'Äôs largest theater chain. 'ÄúIndian films were another attraction. Even without theaters, Indian films proved to sell better than any other in pirated DVD kiosks,'Äù he added. Raisa Kamila recalled her memories as a junior high school student in 2004. 'ÄúThe last surviving theater was the Gadjah XXI. There was another one in Beurawe shopping center that closed in 2003, the Djelita Theater. I never went there, but they used to put out raunchy posters.'Äù 'ÄúThere were bioskop named Pas XXI or Gajah XXI, but in no way were they part of 21 Cineplex Group,'Äù said Raisa. Bioskop Pas XXI had long stopped operating their studios, after a big fire in 2001. 'ÄúThey just borrowed the name.'Äù Grindhouses were not unique to Aceh: The still-operational Grand and Mulia Agung theaters, which sit next to Plaza Atrium shopping mall in Senen, Central Jakarta, are bioskop mesum. In recent years, however, different towns in Java have witnessed threats or even physical attacks against the theaters. A local FPI chapter, for instance, threatened to shut down a bioskop mesum, the Borobudur Cinema in Pekalongan, Central Java, during Ramadhan in 2013. The decline of the theaters into grindhouses parallels the rise of the 21 Cineplex network, the nation'Äôs largest film exhibitor. According to a report compiled by Film Indonesia in 2012, hundreds of independent movie theaters throughout the nation rely on low-cost independent distributors, whose supplies of film prints are limited, according to researcher Adrian Jonathan Pasaribu. (Courtesy of Harun Keuchik Leumik) 'ÄúSince its entry to the distribution business in early 1990s, the 21 Cineplex group has possessed powerful control over access to the latest films, more than any regular national distributor. In practice, they sell the films, buy the films, and in so doing tear down their competitors,'Äù Pasaribu said. Independent theaters within 50 kilometers of a 21 Cineplex chain theater cannot license current Hollywood releases films from local distributors that do business with 21 Cineplex, prompting owners to buy the rights to the only films they can: ancient action and sexploitation films, according to Pasaribu. Viewers stayed home and watched DVDs, leading to dwindling tickets sales and owners who could not afford to upgrade facilities or obtain in-demand movies 'Äî leading to more closures and worse conditions. The result was consolidation 'Äî and isolation. While more than 800 movies screens in the nation are owned by the 21 Cineplex group and its main competitor, Blitz Megaplex, the Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry says that there are theaters in only 55 of the nation'Äôs 538 cities and regencies. Nine provinces have no cinemas whatsoever: Central Sulawesi, West Sulawesi, West Nusa Tenggara, East Nusa Tenggara, Aceh, Gorontalo, Bangka Belintung, North Maluku and West Papua. 21 Cineplex spokeswoman Catherine Keng, however, remains upbeat. 'Äú21 Cineplex plans to expand its theaters to Java, but also to eastern parts of Indonesia, Kalimantan and Sumatra. Aceh is part of this.'Äù However, when asked if 21 Cineplex has established contact with local authorities, Catherine answered: 'ÄúNot yet'Äù. Before the tsunami, young couples would often see movies at the grindhouses in Banda Aceh. However, now some consider sitting in a dark room un-Islamic, focusing on what appears on screen as opposed to the distribution system that has led to the demise of the silver screen in Aceh.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/08/24/bioskop-mesum-grindhouse-cinemas-and-slow-death-movies-aceh.html,,2014

James Waworoendeng FPI to hold rally against Ahok on Wednesday Sept. 21, Online The hardline Islamic group, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), plans to hold a demonstration against the appointment of current Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama as new Jakarta governor in October. Your comments: I quote: 'ÄúWe are rejecting Ahok as governor because he is arrogant and ignorant'Äù. Well, on that logic, the FPI should reject themselves. Well played, Ahok. Nate Good to know Ahok is not intimidated by the FPI. Let them carry out their demonstration. Chotto mattee It is time for police to show some intestinal fortitude and do their job.

A Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) investigation into their funding is long overdue. Ian Thomson It'Äôs like when some posters appeared in my neighborhood saying 'ÄúWe, the local people, strongly reject the building of a church in this area.'Äù Neither I nor any of my neighbors had any idea who put up the posters.

Simaging Sustainable production of palm oil Sept. 22, p8 I would like to comment on the article, 'ÄúPaying for biofuel with the environment'Äù (The Jakarta Post, Sept. 15) by Priscilla Liu. The article states: 'ÄúThe popular perception that biofuel is 'Äògreen'Äô and environmentally good must be changed.'Äù (By Roman Kuznik, Jakarta) Your comments: These are good comparisons between the different vegetable oils for biofuel, but I presume you mean the Indonesian mills and plantations when you mentioned: 'ÄúThe mills are using more or less the same technology that they used 30 years ago, and the yields on oil palm plantations has, on average, not increased significantly.'Äù From what I am seeing on the Malaysian side, research and development has seen enough progress so that the Malaysians are talking about boosting high yield seeds without the need for increased acreage. Additional measures like the capture of methane gas from mills in Malaysia have to be factored into rating the 'Äúgreenness'Äù of biofuel from palm oil. To lump Malaysian products in with largely unregulated Indonesian ones, is to discourage better producers from stepping up to deliver greener biofuel feedstock. We must divest from fossil fuels, leave black oil in the ground and work toward fuel above ground, but a clear distinction must be made as to the source of biofuel.

"Fri, September 26, 2014",Issue of the day: FPI members flock to City Council to protest Ahok,"Sept. 24, Online The hardline Islam Defenders Front (FPI) fulfilled its promise to hold a demonstration at City Council on Wednesday. Hundreds of FPI members, who wore white uniforms and brought banners reading 'ÄúHey Ahok, shut your mouth!'Äù, arrived at the building on Jl. Kebon Sirih in Central Jakarta at 11 a.m., after starting their march from FPI headquarters on Jl. KS Tubun, Petamburan in West Jakarta at 9 a.m. After demonstrating at the council building, they planned to continue to City Hall to look for Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama. The hardline group held the demonstration to show its rejection of Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent who will replace Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo, a Muslim of Javanese descent, as governor of Jakarta when the People'Äôs Consultative Assembly (MPR) inaugurates Jokowi as the country'Äôs seventh president on Oct. 20. Your comments: I like his quotes published elsewhere along the lines: 'ÄúThey don'Äôt like me. So what? I also don'Äôt like the FPI. Bring it on and please violate existing laws. Your three strikes are used up and I am more of a 'Äòone strike and you are out'Äô kind of guy'Äù.

It'Äôs time these people realize that the vast majority of the Muslim population of Jakarta actually voted for him in the first place. Most Jakartans don'Äôt want a governor motivated by religion. They saw how Fauzi Bozo failed; they want someone who can get things done. You can bet that outside the likes of the FPI, the vast majority of Muslim Indonesians are happy with what Ahok is doing for the people. The FPI only cares about itself. LAF Even non-FPI members are now joining the demos! Ahok is so arrogant that he doesn'Äôt even realize what he has done! He left the protection of the Gerindra Party and went out on his own, thinking of even reaching the presidency! Dream on, man.

"Sat, September 27, 2014",Issue of the day: FPI threatens Chinese Indonesians,"Sept. 25, p9 The hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) launched threats against minority groups during a rally on Wednesday opposing Deputy Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama, who is to replace current Governor and president-elect Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo. Hundreds of FPI members marched to the City Council building on Jl. Kebon Sirih, Central Jakarta, located in the same compound as City Hall, causing several hours of traffic gridlock in the area. The group'Äôs opposition is based on Ahok'Äôs alleged insensitivity regarding issues of ethnicity, religion and race. Ahok is a Christian of Chinese descent. While entering the City Council, one FPI member shouted 'ÄúIf [Ahok] dares to challenge us Betawi people even once, I will not sit still. I'Äôll rid Jakarta of all its ethnic Chinese residents!'Äù Another member responded with 'ÄúKill Ahok!'Äù During a meeting between representatives of the FPI and the City Council, FPI Jakarta chapter head Salim Al Athas, popularly known as Habib Selon, called on the City Council not to inaugurate Ahok as governor. Your comments: I hope Indonesia will not take a step into the past. Mike The FPI does not represent Indonesian Muslims. They use the name of Islam for political gain. When the FPI protested against Ahok, they were received by three Jakarta legislators. Jakarta is controlled by thugs who know how to adapt to the democratic era: They create organizations and they run for legislator, whereas they used to only control the streets and markets. Gatot Santoso Wibowo This is just the FPI exercising their right to spread hatred and racism throughout this republic. That'Äôs what they do 'Äî that'Äôs what the powers-that-be have been allowing them to do all these years. I wonder if Jokowi, as president, and therefore commander of the police, will change things? Terry McAsee The comments could be considered defamation of character. But who cares? Ahok doesn'Äôt. He said go ahead with the demonstration, but once they step into City Hall and cause trouble, then he will finish them. Ashn Tray Death threats, small or large, should be looked into, especially because this is becoming such a serious matter. I think it is foolish that the police did not respond to this. Some 'Äî not all 'Äî people are looking not at the credibility of their leader, but at his or her religion. This country bears the motto 'Äúunity in diversity'Äù; I am appalled that this principle isn'Äôt respected. We should be able to accept each other and not limit each other by race, religion or skin color. We are only harming ourselves by such constraints. Tempe Time for the police to act, but they just don'Äôt have the guts, as it looks like this group is backed by a strong party. AA I don'Äôt support the FPI, though I do support their right to protest, as should we all. Take rights away from one group and soon none of us will have any rights at all.

"Sun, September 28, 2014",The week in review: Protests and maneuvers,"On Friday Indonesians were in shock over the result of the House of Representatives'Äô plenary session, which began late Thursday, and which has led us back to the days of indirect elections for governors, regents and mayors. From Washington, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono also expressed his disappointment, including over the walk-out maneuver of his own Democrat Party, which caused the defeat of the pro-direct election camp. Yudhoyono said his party would take legal action, and as President he said he was extremely reluctant to sign the new law, but nobody was listening. Amid public uproar expressed through the Twitter hashtag #ShameonyouSBY, individuals and civil organizations signed petitions and made immediate preparations to demand a judicial review of the new law by the Constitutional Court. The Red-and-White Coalition led by Prabowo Subianto'Äôs Gerindra Party communicated the feelings of many who are sick of direct elections, which have led to widespread corruption in the form of candidates bribing potential voters and then paying back their political debts. But many others differentiate the excess of direct elections from the hard-won citizen'Äôs right to choose one'Äôs leader and from corrupt practices that happen for any other reason. The latest case is the arrest of Riau Governor Annas Maamun. The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) caught him and members of his family red-handed, it said, in a housing complex in East Jakarta. The KPK said Annas was caught accepting money from a businessman in the palm oil industry. Following the House'Äôs vote, the outspoken Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama said things would be business as usual 'Äî with no direct elections to prepare for, he said he would just focus on fixing the capital for the next three years of his term. He is busy facing his own protesters, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), whose members flocked to the Jakarta Legislative Council building on Wednesday. The members marched peacefully and unfurled banners which read: 'ÄúHey Ahok, shut up!'Äù, and expressed their refusal to accept Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent who will replace Governor Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo, after the latter is inaugurated by the People'Äôs Consultative Assembly (MPR) as seventh president on Oct. 20. They called on the council not to inaugurate Ahok as governor given his perceived arrogance and insensitivity regarding issues of ethnicity, religion and race. Ahok should not lead Jakarta, they said, because it is a majority Muslim city. The FPI are also worried that Ahok intends to carry out a process of Christianization by installing Christians as leaders of Muslim-majority areas. The protesters dispersed after their complaints were received by City Council speaker Prasetio Edi Marsudi of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P). Prasetio said it would be impossible for the council not to inaugurate Ahok as his ascension was automatic according to existing regulations. Councilor Hasan Basri Umar stated that Indonesia was not an Islamic country and that all its citizens were obliged to abide by the Constitution without exceptions. *** The other drama of the week was Wednesday'Äôs decision by the Corruption Court to sentence former Democratic Party chairman Anas Urbaningrum to eight years in prison and a fine of Rp 300 million (US$24,900) for graft and money laundering. The verdict ended not only the graft trial, but also a long saga of rent-seeking practices. The sentence against Anas, who was also ordered to pay Rp 57 billion in restitution to the state, or have his assets seized, was delivered by the court amid the uncovering of many other cases of rampant corruption. The rent-seeking practices largely involve collection of money from government projects financed by the state budget, such as the construction of the multi-billion rupiah Hambalang sports complex in Bogor, West Java. The Anas case involves high-ranking officials of the ruling Democratic Party, including former party treasurer Muhammad Nazaruddin, former youth and sports minister Andi Mallarangeng and former legislator Angelina Sondakh, now all behind bars. The drama reached its peak when the KPK named Anas a suspect in the Hambalang graft case in February 2013. This led Anas to quit his position as the Democratic Party'Äôs chairman. Anas'Äô sentencing coincided with the last days of the tenure of the government of Yudhoyono, who had just said goodbye to world leaders at the UN Climate Summit in New York. Following the Thursday night-Friday morning House plenary session, one Facebook status read, 'ÄúBye bye SBY'Äù. In their last plenary session before their term ends on Sept. 30, lawmakers also rushed through several laws apart from the one on regional elections, including the law on military discipline to replace a 1997 law, a fairly easy one compared to another bill over a decade old, the bill on military tribunals. A bolder batch of lawmakers oriented to the electorate is among the public'Äôs expectations for the new men and women to be installed on Oct. 1.

"Thu, October 9, 2014",Your letters: Equality for all ethnicities,"Indonesia is founded upon the principles of diversity and equality among people of different races and religions. Our country has as its central principle the slogan Bhinneka Tunggal Ika. This means that even though we are different, we are one. This principle embraces diversity and acknowledges that we as a country benefit from the diversity of our citizens. This principle is supposed to be carried over to the election of governmental officials. Article 28 D (3) of the Indonesian Constitution states that every Indonesian citizen should have equal opportunities in government. In reality, these principles are empty. The Indonesian government and manyIndonesian people do not accept ethnic minorities as equal. There is an unspoken law that only people of Javanese ethnicity can become president of Indonesia. This does not respect the values laid forth in our Constitution, meant to be the highest norm and the protector of fundamental human rights in Indonesia. The discrimination against ethnic minorities has been especially visible in the treatment of Chinese Indonesians running for office. Nothing is more representative of this problem than the protests against the Deputy Governor of Jakarta, Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama, who is to replace current Governor and president-elect Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo. This development has been met by protests from the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), a group known for its intolerance and hate crimes. Members of the FPI claim that Ahok has shown insensitivity on issues of race, religion and ethnicity. This comes across as immensely hypocritical, as some FPI members have threatened to rid Jakarta of all Chinese Indonesians. Ahok is a Christian, and protestors claim that, for this reason, he should not lead a city that is primarily Muslim. These arguments are intolerant and outdated. Both Christians and citizens of Chinese descent have been an essential part of Indonesia for years. They should be accepted and welcomed in all offices. The FPI represents an extreme view, but through all of Indonesia there seems to be an invisible barrier to Chinese Indonesians. This must end. People should never be judged based on their skin color. Skin color has absolutely no correlation to skills or leadership traits. If Indonesia is to be the best country it can be, we must take full advantage of the skills of all of our citizens of every ethnicity. We must follow our founding principles and fully embrace Indonesian citizens of all beliefs, backgrounds and ethnicities.

Second, even many Muslims agree that the FPI is not in conjunction with and has even threatened the real, true principles and teachings of Islam.

"Thu, October 16, 2014",Issue of the day: FPI insists no need for disbandment,"Oct. 11, Online Secretary-general of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) Jafar Shodiq says the government should not disband his organization. The statement was made in response to National Police chief Gen. Sutarman who has called for the disbandment of violent organizations. 'ÄúIf our members make mistakes, we will rebuke them and ask them to be responsible for their actions according to the law. We will also ask them to turn themselves in to the police. [Errant individuals should be punished according to the law] instead of disbanding the whole organization to which they belong,'Äù he said on Saturday as quoted by kompas.com. He said the FPI'Äôs Jakarta chapter had been reprimanded by the FPI'Äôs central board for the violence they had caused during last week'Äôs rally in front of City Hall. The rally was organized to demand the city council annul its plan to install Basuki 'ÄòAhok'Äô Tjahaja Purnama as the new governor as he is of Chinese descent and is a Christian. Your comments: This article shows that the FPI is running scared. They never worried before because no one would stand up to them and say enough is enough, you have to go. Now, they are pissed off that the deputy governor thinks they would get more support from the Red-and-White Coalition, which immediately came out with a statement saying that the FPI didn'Äôt confer with them this one time and they would have said not to do what they did. Even though the FPI saw that Ahok had been receiving more support than it expected he would, the members weren'Äôt worried because no one with any authority had come out against them. Then, along comes the Jakarta police chief calling for the disbandment of the Jakarta branch of the FPI. Now they are scared. The National Police chief has some weight to throw around. He can pressure people with a lot of different things to get his way. I can see the FPI finally getting disbanded, but I don'Äôt see its members going away. X. Simaging Well, let'Äôs see how the president- elect deals with this after his inauguration. Ed Ridwan Who are they to demand anything and expect the government to bow at their feet? No real sense of Islam whatsoever. Fank Musiol It'Äôs peace and learning to tolerate other people that makes this society harmonious. It'Äôs about being a good example to influence people to do better. Just by showing violence or passing certain laws will not stop people from going to do sinful things; they must be educated. The problem with extremists nowadays, they use God as an excuse for their own power, money and will. Cape Indonesia is a multi-religious society with large populations of Christians (in Batak, Manado and Poso, for example), as well as Hindus in Bali and parts of East Java. It also has animist Dayak groups. These minorities were promised that they would have their religious rights protected by Pancasila. The Republic of Indonesia is not an Islamic state like Iran. These extremists need to learn tolerance and respect. Lasem Benny Two decades or so ago, many villages were without electricity; thus they had no TV or the Internet. Kids (12 to 15 years of age) from the villages are now a little familiar with the use of hand-held phones. There are so many old fogies that are now capable of using a cell phone: a change in lifestyles, etc., or a metamorphosis. I'Äôve lived with the wealthy and the downtrodden. The latter'Äôs awareness of his or her surroundings have improved tremendously. I am optimistic that this country will improve in good time, though not in leaps and bounds. Progress is on the horizon. Wouldn'Äôt it be nice if after the first five years with Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo and the second, Jokowi picks up Ahok to continue for the next 10 years? Am I dreaming? No one can deny this possibility. Jokowi will lead Indonesians into prosperity. Just give him support and some time to crank up his machinery. Jokowi has all the virtues to be a fine leader of Indonesia. Indonesians must show their support for him because they are his lifeblood. He cannot stand alone. Unfortunately, I will not be around to witness his inauguration on the 20th of this month. Valky Rie FPI and other extremist groups have managed to get away lightly for the many atrocious things they do to other people who dare to be different from them. It'Äôs time to put a stop to this and give them as heavy a punishment as possible for the violence they have done. Marvin Sapiens The charge should be three years for plotting violence, three years for organizing a riot to disrupt public order, three years for threatening bodily harm to the governor, three years for actually causing hurt to law enforcement officers, i.e. the police, three years for carrying dangerous weapons with the intent to cause injury and three years for evading arrest and justice.

There are indeed growing voices that believe in the Constitution, but the group that calls itself the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) has got away with blue murder for far too long right under the noses of every single Indonesian. Calling out and chanting that Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama is an 'Äúignorant infidel'Äù in its demonstrations against Ahok'Äôs promotion to governor of Jakarta says little of their intelligence and manners. It should be easy to ban them on the grounds that they disturb civil society by taking the law into their own hands. Democracy gives people the right to peacefully demonstrate, but not if they bring bags of rocks, knives and other weapons. The various comments made by people in the House of Representatives in favor of the FPI were typical of people who know little about democracy. Indonesia has a police force, so it is their job to police the state and not the FPI. If Ahok is outspoken and is calling lazy people lazy, and dishonest people thieves, then good luck to him, as they ought to know the reason they are being sacked. A good shake up in government offices will frighten the people to death. It'Äôs taken at least 60 years for this to happen and in that time this country has been consistently and systematically raked off. So Ahok wants an honest, hard-working and efficient administration.

"Sat, September 15 2012",Police boost security at embassies,"The Jakarta Police are increasing security at embassies in the capital as local Muslims join protests over a low-budget anti-Muslim film that has fueled anti-US sentiment in the Islamic world. Hundreds of members of Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) rallied in front of the US Embassy after prayers on Friday, blasting the US government for allowing the production of the film, Innocence of Muslims, which they said offended Islam and the Prophet Muhammad. “Anyone who offends the Prophet, whether he is Muslim or not, should be punished,” HTI spokesman Muhammad Ismail Yusanto said. The police deployed 300 officers to safeguard the embassy during the protest. “The rally started at 1:45 p.m. with around 200 people, mostly women and children, joining,” Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto said. Anti-US sentiment has continued to persist in Indonesia, despite Washington’s efforts to boost relations with Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation and an important part of the US’ new “pivot” toward Asia. Jakarta Police chief Untung S. Rajab said that police were bracing for more protests at embassies. “Security will be intensified. We have asked officers on duty at the embassies to increase their vigilance,” he said. Untung declined to specify how many additional officers would be deployed to secure potential protests. Meanwhile, requests from the government to YouTube to block access to the film’s trailer apparently went unheeded as of Friday. Friday’s protest was not the first against the defamation of Muhammad in recent years. In 2006, hundreds of men from the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) attacked the US embassy during a rally accusing Washington of masterminding the Danish cartoon controversy, hurling stones and traffic cones at the windows of embassy security posts. In 2008, the HTI and the FPI also held rallies in front of the Dutch embassy to protest the release of Fitna, an anti-Islam short film made by Dutch parliamentarian Geert Wilders.

"Fri, September 21 2012","Addicted to mockery, incitement","This formula recurs repeatedly throughout Muslim countries blasphemy is always responded to with anger. For some Muslim groups, those who mock their sacred beliefs must be punished. However, with no legal power to punish the mockers, rage is directed at whoever is considered as abetting in the mockery. The embassies of the US, Germany and UK in the Middle East, despite having nothing to do with the movie Innocence of Muslims, were attacked in the subsequent protests against it. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens along with another three US officials, entirely unconnected with the movie, were killed during an attack on a US consulate in Libya. In many cases, from Benedict XVI’s speech in Germany, the Danish cartoons, to Geert Wilders’ movie Fitna, it was the face of violent outrage that represented Muslims across the world. This time Sam Bacile, the pseudonymous maker of Innocence of Muslims, reaped similar dramatic outrage from Muslim groups from Benghazi to Jakarta to previous cases of blasphemy. Let us make the case simple. Do you not see what will happen when you continually show outrage at being mocked? People will think that their mockery works. Rather than desisting from making fun of you, they will heap more ridicule on you. Realizing that you are childish, having no ability to restrain yourself from fury, mockers will become more creative in their efforts to disparage you. Indeed, mockers of Islam always get what they expect from their nasty ideas. They know that discrediting Islam — no matter how disreputable their sense of humor and artistic tastes are — is a risk worth taking. Upon hearing the death threats, the mockers go into hiding to attract more public attention. What is clear is that drawing cartoons and producing movies denigrating Islam and Muslims always yield more public outrage in the Muslim world than the mockers could ever hope for in their wildest imagination. On the other hand, public anger can also serve as rhetoric and a method of political bargaining. Radicalism and conservatism find a medium by which Muslim solidarity can be roused. As seen in various mass protests, self-victimization has indeed been an effective tool to produce a Muslim collective identity that had been marginalized during times of liberal democracy and free markets. To put the point differently, amid the public outrage against the blasphemies committed by those want to take advantage of Muslim volatility, Islamism has gained a momentum to further agitate Muslim sentiment. The conspiracy theory suggesting that the West systematically weakens Islam is further borne out. Imagine this. When a small child is faced with contempt from his bigger friend, the former shows anger in a rather unique way. The victim, who lacks the courage to face the bigger child, will throw a tantrum, during which the smaller child lashes out at other children of equal size. On the other hand, upon seeing the victim’s outrage and overreaction to mockery, the bigger child feels a sense of satisfaction. Surprisingly, both the mocker and victim enjoy the mockery game. Both parties are addicted to mockery. Whenever the bigger child repeatedly mocks the small one, the latter runs amok. Whereas the mocker takes pleasure in seeing the victim’s delinquent violence, the victim also exercises his power over his friends. In other words, the two sides reap benefits. Not only is the producer of Innocence of Muslims satisfied at seeing the reactions against his work, conservative and radical Islamists also seize the momentum. Showing anger publicly is also an exercise of power. The ritual of mass rallies are re-enacted in various cities across the Muslim world. Although most never see the movie, they pretend to get angry. Of course, their protest does not always convey their religious feelings but rather political gamesmanship. Nonetheless, in Jakarta, the movie has not brought forth significant fruit. The radical groups — the Islamic Community Forum (FUI), Indonesian Hisbut Tahrir (HTI) and FPI (Islam Defenders Front) — failed in their mission to exercise power in public. As politics is always local, local issue dominate people’s priorities in the capital city. Jakarta’s gubernatorial election buried the radicals’ reactions against the movie. Poor Bacile. Poor FUI, HTI and FPI! All in all, when you fall into bankruptcy, like the alleged moviemaker who was imprisoned due to bank fraud, you need an alternative career and committing blasphemy against Islamic symbols sounds promising. If you want to attract the world’s attention, so that major global news channels will mention your name, make a movie or draw a cartoon despising Muslims.

"Mon, September 24 2012",FPI seals 7-Eleven outlet in S. Jakarta,"JAKARTA: Some 20 members of hard-line group the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) sealed a 7-Eleven convenience store in Pejaten, South Jakarta, on Saturday evening following rumors that it had yet to secure its building permit. The Pasar Minggu police precinct commander, Comr.

The group then put up a banner that read “This building is sealed by the residents of West Pejaten/Jati Padang because it has not obtained building and business permits, as well as permits from local residents”. The FPI also objected the shop’s sales of alcoholic drinks. Shop attendants immediately left the outlet after the mob put up the sign. Adri said that he and another 20 police officers talked to the FPI members, but did not impose any punishment on the mob, given the fact that they did not commit any acts of vandalism. According to Adri, the group had planned another raid on an entertainment center just minutes after they sealed the convenience store. However, Adri said that police officers managed to convince them to cancel their plans.

"Mon, September 24 2012",Intolerance and foreign policy,"Democratization has given all in Indonesia’s society, including Muslims, the opportunity to have their voices heard. Not only moderate Muslims, but Islamist militant groups also rise to the surface and express their views, with the latter apparently overshadowing the former. Foreign observers, therefore, may view the resurgence of Islam in Indonesia simply as the rise of militant Islam. Indeed, Islamist militant groups such as the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) often demonstrate their acts of intolerance and in the name of Islamic propagation, or da’wah, the FPI has often raided restaurants and nightclubs during Ramadhan. It also has harassed intellectual forums it deems as threatening Islamic teachings as in the case of discussions featuring Muslim scholar Irshad Manji in Jakarta and Yogyakarta just a few months ago. Sadly, the culture of violence has not only characterized Islamist radical groups but also moderate organizations like Nahdlatul Ulama (NU). Dozens of NU followers attacked adherents of minority Shiites in the Madura town of Sampang during the Idul Fitri holiday recently. Whatever the motives, the sequence of religious intolerance has damaged Indonesia’s image, domestically and internationally. For this reason, some say Indonesia is not a model of Muslim democracy despite news portraying the country’s tolerance and freedom of religion and expression. This, indeed, runs counter to the aim of Indonesian foreign policy explicitly enunciated by President Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) in 2005. The President envisioned Indonesian identity as the world’s largest Muslim population country and the world’s third largest democracy. Indonesia is said to be a country where Islam, democracy and modernity can develop hand in hand. Indonesian officials have promoted this projected identity as a selling point in various international forums. Previously considered an enemy and a liability during the Sukarno and Soeharto eras, Islam, particularly moderate Islam, is regarded an invaluable asset for Indonesian diplomacy. Utilizing moderate Islam, Indonesia sets its sight on bridging the West and the Muslim world. It foresees itself as a role model for other Muslim countries on current global discourse concerning Islam, democracy and modernity. This projected image has been manifested in various initiatives. Indonesia facilitated a meeting between Iraqi Shiite and Sunni groups in Bogor in April 2007. The SBY administration has promoted regional interfaith dialogues and encouraged religious organizations such as the NU and Muhammadiyah to organize a series of meetings at the International Conference of Islamic Scholars and the World Peace Forum. Indonesia has got involved in the Middle East conflict. Another involvement is Indonesia’s participation at the Annapolis conference in the US on Nov. 27, 2007. It has also taken part in the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon by sending a large contingent to assist. Many other similar diplomatic activities have been conducted in this regard. These activities indicate the country’s efforts to play a pivotal role as a bridge between the West and Muslim countries and as a democratic Muslim model. The degree to which Indonesia has succeeded in this regard is subject to debate. Indonesia’s projected international identity as the largest Muslim democracy has a strong basis. Historically, Muslims have been part of and have played a pivotal role in the country’s independence struggle as well as the nation’s building. Indonesian Muslims, who account for 88 percent of the population, have proved their moderate character in the country’s electoral history. A study by Barton ( 2010 ) shows us that Indonesian Muslims have no objection to secular democracy. Barton’s study reinforces Mujani and Liddle’s study ( 2009 ) which convincingly elucidates this phenomenon. Secular political parties have dominated Indonesian politics for a decade of democratic era in the country. The fears of being an illiberal democratic country — as can be seen with other Muslim majority countries — have proven fallacious. The results of legislative elections and two direct presidential elections since 1999 as well as hundreds of regional elections evidence the primacy of a secular democracy. The Islamist parties lost significant support from Muslims and the phenomenon looks to continue in the future. Despite the existing religious intolerance and undemocratic practices affecting its diplomatic posture, Indonesia can still claim itself a homegrown country for a living in harmony of Islam, democracy and modernity. Therefore, Indonesia should reflect this distinctive identity in its international diplomacy. A lot of effort is required to sustain Indonesia’s international identity. The government needs to reinforce the voice of Muslim moderates and settle the existing problem of religious intolerance and other cases that might dampen democracy and religious tolerance altogether. Subsequently, it is necessary for the government, which is supported by other stakeholders, to establish a mechanism to prevent religious intolerance and the possibility of the emergence of radicalism. Although radicalism does not automatically lead to terrorism, it is common that terrorism starts from radicalism. The government must strictly enforce the law against those involved in acts of religious intolerance as in the cases of persecution against the minorities like Ahmadiyah followers and Shiites as well as the notorious hard-line groups like the FPI. International diplomacy should be sustained by domestic politics since foreign policy begins at home.

"Tue, September 25 2012",Analysis: Jokowi-Ahok signal many wins for Indonesia,"Every Jakartan who voted for the winning pair in the capital’s gubernatorial elections last week knew exactly what they were doing. On the one hand they rejected the incumbent, a son of the city, angered by the many failures that have made living in the big city a misery for many. On the other, they recognized Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s successes in Surakarta (Solo) and pinned their hopes for a better Jakarta on the man who has kept his promises. Most Jakartans have never been to Solo and most never will. But everybody knows success breeds success. At least they hope so. And, by endorsing his ethnic Chinese running mate Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama as well, Jakarta sent another message to all of Indonesia. A stronghold of conservative Islam, Jakarta’s overwhelming majority of Muslims looked beyond race and religion to support the senior-most Chinese official ever to be elected to public office in this new democracy. The capital’s infamous race riots that marked the end of a dictatorship seem well and truly forgotten. This is a major milestone, a social triumph that heralds a new beginning for a new Indonesia. In just a few days, the electoral victory will be announced officially. Then will begin the difficult task of addressing the tasks voters want fixed, urgently. On top of that list of urgent “Things To Do” must sit the visible mess that is strangling Jakarta. Like most of Indonesia’s big cities, traffic congestion is an everyday nightmare. It has a negative impact on productivity, the environment and health. We know that a metro rail system is essential, but even if it were to magically appear across the city tomorrow, it wouldn’t be enough to resuscitate the choked city. It needs more of everything that makes urban living easier for everyone. More corridors overhead, more flyovers, more underpasses. More footpaths, more overbridges, more traffic lights. Beyond traffic and transportation, the city’s other ailments crying out for the new team’s attention include sanitation, flood control and waste management. On a different note, but equally important is the need for an end to the extra-judicial authority the FPI have acquired during the Fauzi Bowo years. Jokowi-Ahok have been given the mandate, they will now be watched by all Jakartans, supporters and opponents alike. The winning pair would do well to remember that Jakartans are even more critical than the average Indonesian on key political issues. On corruption, distrust of government, management ability, residents of the capital have even less faith in their political leaders. The big question that many will ask is where will all the money come from? Endemic corruption isn’t going to disappear overnight, but renewed efforts to combat the cancer would be well received. Most importantly, all concerned need to take courage from the remarkably good shape of the consumer economy. This week’s accompanying chart captures the transformation that has taken place in just the last five years. From “bad time” to “good time”, the cross-over is now complete and heading in the right direction despite the occasional flutter or two. The real economy is in good shape, with consumption today and demand tomorrow as robust as ever. Money that will need to be borrowed for infrastructure development will create thousands of new well-paid jobs, all helping to turn the wheels of the economy. We don’t need pundits to explain the obvious dividends, the return on investment. The line that tracks the “Good time to buy” sentiment happens to run almost identical to the line that records the march of Indonesia’s rising middle class. Coincidental? Not really. One line has shot up from 27 percent of the population to 50 percent in 5 years, as seen in the chart. The other, seen in previous editions of this column, has seen the country’s middle class grow steadily from 28 to 49 percent. To reiterate, that definition is based on households which own a TV set, a refrigerator, a car or a motorcycle. It is the aspirations of this growing class, and those who are striving to join the fold, that the Jokowi-Ahok team will need to satisfy. Fail them, and they will vote with their feet at the next election. One of the excuses trotted out by the previous administration is their inability to borrow, an apparent violation of current regulations that prevented the city to borrow much needed capital from international institutions. If city administrations cannot borrow funds for infrastructure development, there has got to be another way forward. If changing the binding laws is an unlikely option, private-public partnership is the only other option. Indonesia’s well-wishers — the World Bank, the IMF, the Asian Development Bank among others — would undoubtedly be supportive of the improvements so badly needed in the capital. An example in the making for other city administrations? These opinions are influenced by Roy Morgan Single Source, the country’s largest syndicated survey. More than 26,000 respondents are interviewed every year, week after week. The data is projected to reflect 87 percent of the population 14 years of age and over.

Is that correct? John Hargreaves It is a pity Indonesia has not got a president to enforce the law and the Constitution. Sheldon Archer What am I missing here? This has nothing to do with vandalism or violence — they simply broke the law. Could some senior officer explain this in this forum or could The Jakarta Post investigate this in detail?

"Tue, October 9 2012",Analysis: Talking blasphemy is bad for business,"Presidents can say what they like. They don’t need to consult their people. President Ahmadinejad of Iran can talk about the “elimination of Israel” as often as he wishes. Only he and his coterie know how many people are inspired by that kind of hate speech or who his admirers are. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia can ask members of the United Nations to introduce a “universal law against blasphemy” as often as he wants to. Only he and his inner circle know what good that is likely to do and who the supporters are. President Zardari of Pakistan tried to introduce the very same concept at the very same forum just a year ago. The idea had little fuel and got no traction. Everybody knows the prospects of such a law ever being accepted universally are close to zero. Almost everybody. Freedom of speech is enshrined today in Western cultures. Any examination of media in Western countries would prove beyond doubt that Jesus Christ is more often the target than the Prophet Muhammad, regardless of how we may feel about that particular brand of humor. Each of these societies have laws in place against hatred and discrimination. A specific law against blasphemy would be an intrusion into another sacred space, freedom of speech. It was Mark Twain who said “East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet”. Technology, travel and music are the great unifiers of today challenging the celebrated author. They are helping to bridge the cultural gaps, across the globe. Even as the “dividers” try to “unify” the human race, they fail to appreciate the difference in values that continue to exist. And are likely to continue existing, for a few centuries more. The United States is the world’s most populous “Christian” country, with roughly 65 percent of the population going to a formal place of worship, regularly. Indonesia is the world’s biggest “Muslim” country, with roughly 70 percent of the population going to a formal place of worship, regularly. These numbers have remained constant in the last 12 months but have crawled up a smidgeon over the last five years. Unable to comment on recent changes in American values, our continuing measurement of social values proves Indonesians are becoming more conservative, not liberal, as some religious activists and politicians erroneously suggest. Either way, these are misguided motives to play the religious card for political gain. The evidence will show that there is no scope for the gains they may be seeking. In a remarkable twist of irony, two countries with laws against blasphemy, Egypt and Pakistan, were embroiled in high-profile cases of blasphemy even while President Yudhoyono was in New York making his pitch. A Muslim cleric burnt a Bible in Egypt, a Muslim cleric tore pages out of a Koran in Pakistan. They are both being hauled before the courts in their respective countries. The world is watching. One way or another, the much-awaited outcomes of both prosecutions will affect the battered personalities of both countries on the world stage. In that context, even the staunchest supporters of President Yudhoyono cannot deny the hypocrisy of appealing for a universal law while failing, repeatedly, to use the law that exists in his own country. How many people have been arrested for burning Christian churches around the country, how many have been prosecuted and how many languish in jail? How many for attacks on minority Muslim sects like Shias and Ahmadiyas? How many times have the thugs of the vigilante group FPI been put behind bars for crimes committed under his nose, in the capital city of Jakarta? The answers to these questions are a sad commentary on a president who is bound by the constitution to protect “unity in diversity”, or Bhinneka Tunggal Ika emblazoned below the national emblem. His scholarly predecessor, President Abdurrahman “Gus Dur” Wahid knew better. In light of the current president’s ill-fated proclamations at the 67th General Assembly of The United Nations, the elder is being remembered again for presenting the confident face of Islam. Or any religion for that matter. To paraphrase, he stated the obvious: If our God is strong, if our faith is unshakeable, no abuse from lunatics on the extreme fringes of our societies can hurt us or our God. Simple. Uncomplicated. Even I understand that and I’m no scholar of anything in particular. Adding cling-wrap to a glasshouse will not keep the stones away. If the president was trying to score a few brownie points with his home audience while using a global platform, the theater was ill-conceived. If he believes that the majority of Indonesians, Muslims by faith, are urging him to seek such a law universally, he has little evidence to stand on. He would know that, if he and his advisors had bothered to look for the evidence that is in fact available. But the signals sent out to the world via The United Nations by this widely acknowledged “country of moderate Muslims” can only have negative repercussions. Bad for business, this business of blasphemy. Against the odds, the Indonesian economy is in great shape. But it isn’t invincible. There are many threats to prosperity, global winds that are difficult enough to thwart. There is little appetite in Indonesian society for self-inflicted wounds. The latest black comedy that is now being played out by the National Police against the anticorruption commission KPK has the attention of the people. There are vitally important issues that are crying out for the president’s attention. His silence has led to the jocular new acronym KPK for “Kemana President Kita”, or “where is our president?” This is no laughing matter, it is fundamental to the future prosperity and well-being of Indonesia. If investors see President Yudhoyono as one step behind President Zardari and two steps behind President Ahmadinejad, ideologically speaking, Indonesia will soon need divine assistance. We have only to look at the economies of those two “Islamic republics” to figure out the possible consequences of meddling with the tenets of Pancasila. A conservative society does not mean a fundamentalist mob of bigots. That connection is mistakenly made by too many people too often, not just around the globe but right here in Indonesia. If the president has also jumped to the wrong conclusion, Indonesia will inevitably pay the price. Regardless of the facts, leadership often requires making tough choices. Not far away, President Aquino of The Philippines has taken the brave decision to start promoting contraception in a devoutly Catholic country. He knows he has the influential leaders of the church against him. But as the quips are saying, he is not daunted by the jihadists in his country. He knows that prosperity is the key, and he is determined to make the necessary changes for the good of his people. His report card is becoming enviable, not just this side of the world. All too often nowadays, some Indonesians hark back to the days of Gen. Soeharto. Who can blame them? Luckily for us all, freedom tastes too good to give up.

"Fri, October 12 2012",Issues of the day: FPI opposes Ahok leading Islamic bodies,"Fundamentalist: Members of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) protest in front of the Jakarta City Council on Tuesday. The hard-line group is oncerned that deputy-governor-elect Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnana, who is a Christian, holds positions on the boards of several Islamic bodies. (Antara/Reno Esnir) Oct. 9, Online Secretary for Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) Jakarta Novel said that deputy governor-elect Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, who is a Christian, was not capable of leading several Islamic bodies, including Islamic Center or Alms and Donation Agency (Bazis). The regulation stipulates that deputy governor would hold important positions in eight Islamic agencies in the capital, namely chief patron of Koran language and knowledge Institution (LBIQ), chief patron of Koran reading competition Institute (LPTQ), advisory council chairman of Alms and Donation Agency (Basiz), chief patron of Indonesian Mosque’s Library Board of Trustee (BPPMI), trustee board chairman of Islamic Propagation Coordination (KODI), chairman of the advisory board of the Indonesian Mosque Council (DMI), chairman of the board of trustees Jakarta Islamic Center (JIC) and chairman of the advisory council for Religious Harmony Forum (FKUB). FPI urged the Jakarta City Council to change the regulation immediately. Your comments: The FPI members are supposed to follow the law like everyone else. Not change it to their liking. Sheldon Archer How disgraceful for them to carry the nation flag while their actions are completely contradictory. Reza They are always complaining about something. What should they complain next? Deddy K. Surely Ahok will have an assistant to help him lead those institutions. He wouldn’t intervene with something he doesn’t know about. Indra Here we go again with religion. This country needs a change; obviously laws mean nothing to this organization. How about the people who do not have a religion? Would they not be allowed to lead? Nick The solution is simple. Let go of the ex-officio jobs, let them take care of their own brethrens. Jokowi and Ahok have a more pressing agenda to do for the real residents of Jakarta, such as sanitation, traffic, housing for the poor and education quality. Michelle A If they really want to channel their aspirations, they should have decided to personally pay Jakarta’s coming deputy-governor a visit once he is in office, and courteously discuss a mutually beneficial solution for what they regard as a problem. Immediately staging a protest, in such large numbers, carrying our national flag as well, actually shows that the FPI isn’t at all certain about what it is actually defending. This makes them a laughing stock of all sane Indonesians and genuine Muslims. Tami Let Jokowi hold it. Don’t let it turn into a mass problem. Don’t forget “unity in diversity” is our ideology. Ban Kneel For once I agree with the FPI. Remove those bodies from the government. Let them be run and funded 100 percent by Muslims themselves. Stop using taxpayers’ money for activities that only benefit one group in society. When the bodies are independent (as clearly is the wish of the FPI, unless they only want public money but not public accountability) they will no longer be in danger of falling into the leadership of an unbeliever. Samsudin Berlian The FPI’s protest is reasonable. Moreover, religious matters are not part of local government authority; it is under ministry of religion. If the Islamic bodies are religion agencies, then they must be under coordination of the ministerial office in Jakarta. However if they declare themselves as mass organizations, then they have to accept whoever local government leader is, including Jokowi and Ahok.

"Sat, October 20 2012","Issues of the day: The shooting of Malala, a warning to Indonesia","Oct. 17, p2 Malala Yousufzai is a world heroine to both adults and children — and hopefully will not become a martyr. The 14-year-old campaigner for girls’ education in Pakistan was shot in the head on Oct. 9 for her “obscenity”, in the words of a Taliban spokesman. She is expected to survive, doctors say. Two other girls were also injured as the Taliban fired into a bus while aiming for Malala. Since she was 11 years old, Malala has penned a blog under a pseudonym on the BBC website, sharing her fears but always voicing her determination to get an education. The shooting came days before the first International Day of the Girl Child on Oct. 11, which was inaugurated by the United Nations (UN). The UN stated that the day “focuses attention on the need to address the challenges girls face, promote their empowerment and fulfill their human rights”. (By Ati Nurbaiti) Your comments: The article “The shooting of Malala, a warning to Indonesia” by Ati Nurbaiti was an eye opener. The condition of many women across the continent remains the same. These girls are deprived of education, married off early and are victims of domestic violence. They cannot exercise even basic human rights. It is very sad that a woman here has to resort to men’s wishes, and the gender of a child decides their fate. Those against women’s rights may shoot one Malala, but this episode will inspire a hundred other girls to follow her footsteps and fight for their rights. This act of cowardice will encourage other women to achieve a world where men and women are equal. Niharika Ghosh Purwakarta, West Java Indonesia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Pakistan and Afghanistan are extreme tribes that still engage in the prehistoric practice of bloodshed entertainment.

Their livelihoods depend on others. The only signal sent from these nations is hatred. Listiani Lestari Thank you for writing this. You covered the issue thoroughly. I wish the media would talk more like this, with clear analysis, and help the public understand the issue better. Jimbaran Don’t expect any action from the Indonesian government.

"Wed, October 24 2012",Two men convicted for assaulting FPI member,"The Semarang District Court in Central Java convicted two men for assaulting a member of the Surakarta Islam Defenders Front (FPI). The incident took place in Gandekan, Jebres, Surakarta, in May. Koes Setiawan (alias Iwan Walet) was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment, while Mardi Sugeng (alias Gembor) received 12 months. “Both defendants have been found guilty of assaulting the victim,” presiding judge Boedi Soesanto said while reading the verdict on Tuesday. He added that Koes and Mardi had violated Article 170 of the Criminal Code on Assault. The verdict for Mardi was heavier because he is a recidivist. “We both accept the verdict,” said Koes during the proceedings. The sentence for both defendants was lighter than the edict demanded by prosecutors, prosecutor Bima Suprayoga had previously demanded an 18-month sentence for Koes and a 15-month sentence for Mardi. Koes and Mardi were arrested following reports that they had struck Dwi Pamuji, an FPI member, on Jl. RE Martadinata in Gandekan on May 3. The incident sparked violence between the FPI and another mass organization. Koes and Mardi were originally tried at the Surakarta District Court, however, the court later handed the case to the Semarang District Court based on decree No. 102/ KMA/VIII/2012 issued by the Supreme Court. The decision was made for security reason. The FPI is a hard-line group infamous for its use of threats and violence to stop what it deems as “sinful” activities. On Tuesday, dozens of FPI members were present during the announcement of the verdict — both inside and outside the courtroom. FPI members were visibly upset with the court’s decision and did not accept the judge’s verdict. They yelled, “Let them free! We’ll be waiting for them in Solo [Surakarta],” indicating that they aimed to “judge” Koes and Mardi themselves in Surakarta. The proceedings did end without any incidents, as police officers from the Semarang Police were on hand. Outside the court, the police managed to keep control of the situation when FPI members encountered supporters of the two defendants. This is not the first court case involving FPI members. In July, the Bogor District Court convicted a 17-year-old boy who killed a member of the local branch of the FPI. The boy, Bogor resident Ival Reza Yulian Mahendra, was sentenced to three-and-half years’ imprisonment for fatal assault under Article 351 of the Criminal Code (KUHP).",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/10/24/two-men-convicted-assaulting-fpi-member.html,,2012
"Sat, October 27 2012",FPI attacks Ahmadis in Bandung,"Idul Adha celebrations in Ban-dung, West Java, were tarnished by an attack launched by members of hard-line group the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) on An-Nasir mosque, home to hundreds of Ahmadiyah followers who were later barred from performing Idul Adha prayers and slaughtering animals during the Islamic Day of Sacrifice on Friday. Members of the FPI raided the mosque on Thursday night, damaging it and prohibiting Ahmadis from celebrating Idul Adha. Abdul Wahid Yora, an Ahmadi, said he and some other Ahmadis were at the mosque when 10 people arrived claiming to be local FPI members and entered the mosque. Yora and his two fellow Ahmadis were later forced to sign an agreement not to hold Idul Adha prayers and slaughter sacrificial animals on the day. “I refused to do so because we have the right to perform the religious ritual,” Yora said, adding that the three of them were taken to the Astana Anyar Police precinct. At the police station, Yora claimed that they were still forced to sign the agreement. The three of them were finally released on Friday morning, but when they returned to their mosque, they found the mosque’s entrance gate damaged and its glass windows broken. Ahmadi members decided to abort the Idul Adha prayer, the animal sacrificing ritual and the Friday prayer for security reasons, despite the fact that they received five cows and four goats to be slaughtered and handed out to families. The representative of FPI Ban-dung Raya, Muhammad Asep Abdurahman alias Utep, said that breaking the mosque’s glass windows was a spontaneous action. He said that the three Ahmadis, who were taken to the police, did not want to obey the West Java gubernatorial regulation banning Ahmadis from conducting public activities. “I was angry. I went to the mosque and smashed its windows. My rage was triggered by the Ahmadis’ reaction,” said Utep. West Java Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Martinus Sitompul said that his team had investigated the damage to the mosque. He said the police had gathered evidence and would seek other witnesses. “We will question the FPI about this issue,” he said. Last year, West Java Governor Ahmad Heryawan issued Gubernatorial Regulation No. 12 banning Ahmadis from conducting any public activity. Ahmad claimed that the regulation had reduced attacks against Ahmadis. Therefore, an evaluation of the regulation was unnecessary, he added. However, Ahmad said that physical violence against Ahmadis or their property was not allowed under the law. “The law forbids physical attacks on anyone,” he said as quoted by Antara news agency. “If there are physical assaults uncovered in the last incident, I will let the police handle it,” he said. In the last few years, demands to ban Ahmadiyah have increased in a number of regions across the country. The sect is dubbed heretical by some because it does not follow mainstream Islamic teachings. Ahmadis believe Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is their prophet, but this is considered heretical by mainstream Islam, which recognizes Muhammad as the final prophet while considering Mirza a preacher. There is a history of violent incidents involving the FPI and Ahmadiyah, with FPI members reportedly attacking Ahmadis and damaging their places of worship. Many Ahmadis have also been displaced after being evicted from their homes. Head of internal affairs at Bandung Legal Aid Center Unung Nuralamsyah expressed her regret over the recent incident. “Why did the police put pressure on the Ahmadis? Citizens have their rights to perform their religious practices. The police must investigate the violence,” said Unung.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/10/27/fpi-attacks-ahmadis-bandung.html,,2012
"Sun, October 28 2012",The week in review: Violence on Idul Adha,"As most Muslims in Indonesia peacefully observed Idul Adha on Friday, about 200,000 of their fellow citizens marked the end of the haj pilgrimage in Mecca. Meanwhile, in Bandung, West Java, members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) chose their own way to celebrate the holiday: The infamous hard-line group attacked a usual target — members of the minority Ahmadiyah sect, prohibiting them from slaughtering animals, as is the tradition on the Islamic Day of Sacrifice Once again, the FPI has tarnished the image of Islam in Indonesia. And the police clearly had no courage to enforce the law against thugs who have blatantly and regularly broken the law while assaulting other groups in the name of their narrow view of Islam. Indonesia regularly sends the second-largest contingent of pilgrims to make the haj — Saudi Arabia sends the largest — due to its position as the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation. The number of Indonesians on the waiting list to make the haj has increased significantly every year, due to continued rapid economic growth and a rising awarness among Muslims of the need to carry out the fifth pillar of Islam. Unfortunately, the Religious Affairs Ministry has not provided satisfactory service to Indonesians making the haj. Pilgrims have reported that their expenses have increased while their treatment has worsened, especially when compared to pilgrims from Malaysia. The ministry has been persistent in pushing for the private sector or an autonomous agency to manage the lucrative business. However, it remains unclear when the government will guarantee that its citizens can receive the treatment and service that they are paying for when making the sacred pilgrimage. *** In the meantime, the closure of churches was greeted as business as usual by Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi. Speaking at the Presidential Office, the minister insisted that the authorities in Aceh correctly exercised their authority when shuttering nine churches in the province. The closures come as no surprise, given the extremely conservative interpretation of Islam observed in Aceh. However, such actions have, regretfully, become commonplace throughout the nation, as local governments move to close the places of worship for Christians and minority Muslim sects on a regular basis. Some may wonder how the home minister might respond if one day mosques are forced to close in predominantly Christian regions such as East Nusa Tenggara, or in Bali, where the overwhelming majority of its residents follow Balinese Hinduism. Separately, there was another closure this week, this time in the business world. The Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry revealed that Petronas, the iconic Malaysian oil and gas company, closed 15 of its 19 fuel stations in Indonesia. “They have been experiencing such low sales that they can no longer fund their operations,” according to a ministry official. Along with PT Shell Indonesia and France-based Total Oil Indonesia, PT Petronas Niaga Indonesia is among the few foreign competitors of Pertamina. It is very hard for foreign companies to compete with Pertamina, as they are not allowed to sell the subsidized fuels, the main income source for the state-oil company. *** The Singapore High Court upheld on Tuesday a US$250 million arbritation award for Astro All Asia Network Plc, which is owned by Malaysian tycoon Ananda Krishnan. The Indonesian conglomerate the Lippo Group had to pay the money to its former business partner. The dispute between the former partners started in 2008, three years after they established a joint venture in the pay-TV business in Indonesia. A final settlement, however, is likely still a long away, as the case has also been taken to court in Indonesia by the Lippo Group. In another legal matter, the House of Representatives, NGOs and the public were outraged by the failure of the goverment to provide legal aid to two Indonesians who have received the death penalty in Malaysia, despite claims from Manpower and Transmigration Ministry that they had hired lawyers for Frans Hiu, 22, and Dharry Frully, 20. The illegal migrant workers, who were brothers from East Kalimantan were sentenced to be hanged by the neck until dead on Oct. 18, after they were found guilty of murdering Kharti Raja on Dec. 30, 2010. They insist they were innocent. The saddening fate of Indonesian workers abroad — especially unskilled laborers — will never change as long as the government is reluctant to take firm action to ensure the process follows the law. Action must be taken from the very early stage of worker recruitment; corruption begins with the manipulation of data such as dates of birth and legal names. Very few Indonesian migrant workers receive sufficient training prior to their departure abroad. Of the millions working overseas, too many are fired due to poor performance or outright cheated since they have little knowledge of their rights — and obligations — as workers. *** In Central Sulawesi, police detonated a homemade bomb in the predominantly Christian regency of Poso on Tuesday. According to officials, the bomb was likely intended for detonation using a cell phone. The incident follows the detonation of another homemade bomb on Monday that wounded two police officers and a security guard. More than 1,000 people were killed and 25,000 were displaced during the sectarian war between Muslims and Christians that rocked the regency between 1997 and 2001. The bombs this week offer clear indications new clashes may erupt, unless the government of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono takes firm action. — Kornelius Purba",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/10/28/the-week-review-violence-idul-adha.html,,2012
"Mon, October 29 2012",Suspect in Ahmadiyah mosque attack detained,"The police have named a representative of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) Bandung Raya, M. Asep Abdurahman alias Utep, a suspect in the attack on the mosque belonging to Ahmadiyah followers in Bandung on Thursday evening. “We detained the suspect last night,” Bandung Police chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Widjonarko said on Sunday. The suspect, Widjonarko continued, would probably face multiple charges in connection with his involvement in the attack, such as under Article 170 of the Criminal Code on violent acts in public, Article 406 on destruction and damage of properties and Article 335 on unpleasant acts. Over the last several years, demands to ban Ahmadiyah have increased in a number of regions across the country. The sect is dubbed heretical because it does not follow mainstream Islamic teaching. Ahmadis believe Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is their prophet, but this is considered heretical by mainstream Islam, which recognizes Muhammad as the final prophet while considering Mirza a preacher. Before naming Utep a suspect, the police had questioned at least six witnesses, including Utep. Based on the results of the questioning and evidence collected, Widjonarko said that the police had adequate evidence to name him a suspect. “He led [the attack],” he said. The police are currently developing the case. “It’s possible that there will be more suspects,” he said. As earlier reported, a group from FPI Bandung Raya visited An-Nasir mosque on Thursday evening. Utep, who led the group, was angry to see Ahmadis planning to undertake prayers for Idul Adha — the Islamic Day of Sacrifice — and to slaughter animals as a sacrifice. The FPI members later demanded that the An-Nasir mosque congregation not carry out religious activities at the mosque, including Idul Adha activities. The demand was disclosed at a police office not far from the mosque. Utep based the demand on the West Java Governor Regulation No. 12/2011, issued in March 2011, on the banning of Ahmadiyah activities in West Java. As the demand was not met, Utep left a dialogue forum with Ahmadiyah representatives at the police office to go to the mosque. There damaged windows in the guest room of the mosque. The gate of the mosque was also damaged. The attack disrupted Ahmadi preparations for Idul Adha. At the time of the attack there were 10 Ahmadis in the mosque, including five women. They did not put up any resistance. An-Nasir mosque preacher Abdul Wahid Yora said he was asked to make a written statement saying that he would not hold the Idul Adha prayer and slaughter animals for sacrifice on Friday. “They forced me to, but I resisted. It’s a matter of religious ritual, why should it be banned?” asked Yora, who left the police post at 9 a.m. on Friday. However, upon realizing that parts of the mosque were damaged, Yora decided against going ahead with the planned Idul Adha activities.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/10/29/suspect-ahmadiyah-mosque-attack-detained.html,,2012

There were about 10 Ahmadis preparing for Idul Adha inside the mosque, including several women, when the raid took place, tempo.co reported. Your comments: Punish FPI offenders. Ban the FPI and other radical organizations. Stop labeling which faith is right, which is wrong. Let the people choose themselves. Guarantee safety and peace for all citizens, regardless of their faith. Promote tolerance and discourage violence in the community. Once again the government failed to protect citizens from the violent acts of radicals.

APH Mulders It would have been the duty of the police to ensure that the Ahmadiyah mosque remained open and that the members of the Ahmadi faith could celebrate peacefully the festival of Idul Adha. I am very worried about Indonesia. The way it is going, extremists attacking the Ahmadi Muslims and the government responding in a very lukewarm and irresponsible manner, I am afraid Indonesia (which otherwise would have a bright future) will loose Allah’s blessings. If you want to look at a country that has lost Allah’s blessings look at Pakistan. Is that where you would like Indonesia to be heading? May Allah save you all. Neni Nuraeni If you are a Muslim, then be a good Muslim. Recognition of Muhammad as the last messenger is a must. Don’t replace him by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. If so, make your own religion and don’t call it Islam. Well done to the FPI. Jaya Indonesia celebrated the Youth Pledge Day on Oct 28. It’s been 84 years since this remarkable pledge, which has been lauded as one of the pillars to the country’s independence. Unfortunately, after 84 years, current leaders see no more need for unity. Allowing such blatant acts of intolerance undermines the very sacrifice made during the war for independence. Even with sentiments aside, this is an act of violence which should be subjected to the criminal laws. But then I suppose the idealism of the founding fathers has not succeeded for the laws are partial to Muslims. Why isn’t the central government doing something? So much for that anti-blasphemy speech SBY made at the UN. Christine Pan FPI and Ahmadiyah, both of them make many problems in our country.

The FPI members, most of them wearing long-sleeved, white FPI T-shirts and caps, held their protest in front of the West Java Legislative Council and the West Java governor’s office. They urged the administration to firmly implement the 2011 Governor Regulation No. 12 on the banning of Ahmadiyah activities in West Java. “One of our members has been arrested for damaging the Ahmadis’ mosque. We can accept it if he is found guilty for the assault,” said FPI West Java chairman Abdul Kohar. “But what about the Ahmadis who ignore the regulation and keep on conducting public activities? Should they not also be punished?” Your comments: I believe that most Muslims are peaceful. But unfortunately, there are those extremists and a growing number of them are not peaceful because they practice Islam fully to the core. They manifest the unwanted side of the Koran that which is deemed intolerant or violent in today’s standards.

"Mon, November 26 2012",Shia refugees live in uncertainty,"Beleaguered minority Shia Muslim refugees from Sampang, Madura, East Java, are now facing further uncertainty as the local government stops supplies of their daily needs. Shiite leader Iklil Al Milal said in Surabaya on Sunday that the refugees from Karang Gayam village faced difficulties in getting food and clean water over the last month as the local administration started to cease supplies of the two without reason. Up to 274 Shia followers have been forced to take shelter at a local sports center after the majority Sunnis attacked and burned their village, homes and farm lands, killing two people on Aug. 26 — based simply on the belief that the Shia teachings were heretical. Iklil added that many refugees are distressed as husbands and wives could not lead normal lives due to the poor conditions of the camp. “We decided to stay at the refugee camp due to the absence of security for our lives,” Iklil said, adding that the refugees had been forced to use their own money to buy food and water. The refugees face a quandary as they have run out of money but can not return to their profession as tobacco farmers. Misbahah, 36, one of the refugees, hoped the displacement case could be ended as soon as possible so that she could work again as a tobacco farmer. “Karang Gayam is my birth place where my relative’s graves are located. I don’t want to be evicted from my village,” said Misbahah, who left with her husband Samsuri, 36, and son Hamam Maulidi, 3. “We used to live happily without any pressure from anybody,” she said. “But the happiness is now gone. Aside from being attacked, we have also been forced to convert as our belief is said to be heretical.” The Shia Muslims met with the House of Representatives in Jakarta last week, hoping the lawmakers would help them deal with their problems. However, the lawmakers answered their requests for aid with ethnic slurs and indifference. Coordinator of the Surabaya office of the Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence (Kontras) Andy Irfan said that without a solution from the government, which was in line with their will, they would further face difficulties in ending the Shia refugee problem. The only solution offered declares that Shia followers must be relocated and moved away from Sampang, he said. Young Muslim intellectual Ulil Abshar Abdalla said on Sunday that the problem with Ahmadiyah, Shia and the like consisted mainly of differences in interpreting religious teachings that could not be categorized as desecration. “I think what is said to be a religious desecration simply constitutes hate speech,” he said. As a member of the House of Representatives, Ulil supported a plan to revise Law No. 1/1965 on religion desecration linked to different interpretation of religions with a new law on religious desecration on hate speech. Thousands of members of the Indonesian Ahlul Bait Association (IJABI), which represents minority Shia Muslims, observed Asyura Day peacefully in Bandung on Saturday. IJABI executive Samsudin Baharudin said dozens of Islam Defenders Front (FPI) members arrived at the Lucky Star Convention Hall, where the Asyura commemoration took place, and demanded that the Shia community call off the meeting. IJABI members ignored the FPI members and continued with the commemoration. Samsudin said IJABI members in Bandung were lucky to be able to celebrate Asyura without widespread rejection from the local community. According to him, IJABI members in several cities were barred from commemorating Asyura. Muslims celebrate Asyura Day on the 10th day of the first month of the Islamic calendar to commemorate the death of Imam Hosein, Prophet Muhammad’s grandson and the third imam of Shia who was killed during the battle of Kerbala.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/11/26/shia-refugees-live-uncertainty.html,,2012
"Fri, December 7 2012",Transgender community lies low as intimidation intensifies,"The transgender community has been keeping out of sight in the wake of rising intimidation from the unruly Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and the National Police’s reluctance to protect them, activists have said. Merlyn Sofyan, a transgender activist, said on Wednesday that transgender groups across the archipelago had unwillingly cut down their social and educational events during the past two years amid fears that no one would protect them from extremists in the fire-brand group. “Our situation has been relatively stagnant. The police have not been cooperative. They know that the FPI threatens us, but they make only small efforts,” she told The Jakarta Post in a telephone interview. Merlyn, who is also the 2006 Miss Transgender Indonesia, suggested that the crisis might continue following the forceful closure of a cultural transgender festival by the FPI on Monday in Jakarta. The organizer of the Indonesian Transgender Communication Forum said the police, who witnessed the forcible closure, were reluctant to help the 200 or so transgender people when dozens of FPI members stormed their annual festival. “The FPI said that we had no permit for the event. In fact, we had sent letters requesting a permit to the Jakarta Police, the South Jakarta Police and the Setiabudi police precinct. But, they didn’t respond,” the forum’s chairperson, Yulianus Rettoblaut, said during a press conference on Wednesday. Yulianus suggested that the police may have themselves been intimidated by the FPI. “Days before the festival, an officer from Setiabudi police rang and ordered me to call off the show because the FPI was planning to attack us,” she said. Maruli Tua Rajagukguk from the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI) said that police had violated human rights by declining to issue the permit. “They can only ban an event if it has a negative purpose or threatens national stability and security. Why did they ban this activity? The community only wanted to stage a cultural performance,” he said, referring to the 2005 ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Commenting on the matter, Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto insisted that the transgender forum was not authorized to go ahead. “The police suggested that the event should not be carried out … We assess every activity and if we deem the purpose to be negative, we will not allow it,” he said on Tuesday. Maruli said the YLBHI would assist the transgender forum to report the attack to the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM). “We urge Komnas HAM to demand an explanation from the Jakarta Police chief [Insp. Gen. Putut Eko Bayuseno] and put pressure on the police to take stern action,” he said. Yulianus was unsure, however, whether the perpetrators would ever be brought to court. “Just look at the FPI assault in 2010. To this day, there have been no arrests. The police seem reluctant to pursue such a case,” she said. She was referring to the raid by the hard-line group to a human rights training workshop for transgender individuals, jointly organized by Komnas HAM and the transgender forum, in Depok, West Java. When the Post contacted FPI spokesman Munarman, he declined to comment. (yps/aml)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/12/07/transgender-community-lies-low-intimidation-intensifies.html,,2012
"Mon, December 10 2012",Issues of the day: Police ignore SBY and strike back at KPK,"Dec. 6, p.1 Oblivious to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s order for the police to stay out of the Corruption Eradication Commission’s (KPK) business, the National Police headquarters has decided to withdraw Comr. Novel Baswedan and 12 other officers seconded to the antigraft body. The move came only two days after the KPK locked up Insp. Gen. Djoko Susilo, the main suspect in the driving simulator graft scandal at the National Police Traffic Corps (Korlantas). KPK deputy chairman Busyro Muqqodas confirmed on Wednesday that the National Police made the request in a letter dated Nov. 30. In the letter, the police decided not to extend the tenure of its 13 investigators seconded to the KPK, including Novel, whose terms expire in January 2013. Chief of the National Police Criminal Investigation Directorate (Bareskrim), Comr. Gen. Sutarman said that the decision was firm. Sutarman said he was aware that Novel had opted to become a permanent member of staff at the KPK, but insisted that Novel was still a member of the corps.

Joe I seem to remember the FPI stating quite some time ago: “Nobody listens to SBY.” Sheldon Archer If this is not all-out revenge, then what is it? Are the wealthy police officers, of whom there are many, afraid that the sources of their riches will be revealed?

"Thu, December 27 2012",Issues of the day: MUI nixes Christmas for SBY,"Dec. 24, p. 1 Conservative Muslim leaders are not stopping with edicts forbidding Muslims from wishing Christians a merry Christmas. Now they want the President not to attend any observation of the holiday in an official or personal capacity. A representative of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) renewed on Sunday an fatwa forbidding Muslims from extending holiday greetings to Christians and said that President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono had to skip a national Christmas celebration scheduled for Dec. 27. “If you talk about the MUI edict, it forbids attendance at the [Christmas] rituals. A Muslim should not attend the ritual, because it is a part of worship activities that should only be attended by Christians,” Ma’ruf Amin, the council’s deputy chairman, told The Jakarta Post on Sunday. Your comments: There are differences in interpretation indeed. But these differences are not necessarily problems. There is no need to argue or debate beliefs at the government. The government only needs to prevent the disputes escalating into physical fights. As a multi-cultural nation, the government of Indonesia needs to treat every believer the same, including holidays greetings and attending ceremonies, to show support from the government. It’s a good chance to see if President Yudhoyono is a true statesman, pro-multiculturalism, like our founding fathers, or just a mere just image seeker, who adheres to the demands of a few who claims to be the voice of the majority. Rio Rivai Merry Christmas Indonesia, let peace prevail in my beloved country. Dess What a sad statement from the MUI. They have no right to speak on behalf of the Muslim majority in Indonesia.

Naga Daul It shows that there are differences in interpretations in their own religion. At Lakemba Mosque, the largest in Sydney, Australia, the leaders and community have recognized Christmas for their Christian neighbors etc., by having a plane write Merry X’mas above the mosque.

"Fri, December 28 2012",Digital video makers defending pluralism,"Made: The winners of a video competition pose for a photo with their trophies. JP/Dicky Christanto While some might make use of the digital era in order to create their own private cocoon, utilizing the latest technology for pleasure and separation from the reality of everyday, one group has opted to swim against that current. Those young people are using digital tools to spread awareness, reminding people about the need to honor pluralism and tolerance as the ultimate requirement of a civilized society. Through an online video competition “Bhinneka Tinggal Duka?” (What’s left from Bhinneka Tunggal Ika is only sorrow), organized by Engage Media, they are expressing their concerns. Engage Media is a group of digital media activists who are concerned with social and environmental issues. It is also the name of the website that provides a platform for users to post videos that focus on defending human rights and other issues like pluralism, discrimination and the environment. Dita Caturaning from Engage Media discussed the country’s deteriorating tolerance, which can easily be seen in the burning of Ahmadiyah mosques, the eviction of Shiites in Sampang, Madura and the banning of church congregations in Bekasi, Bogor and other places in the country. She stressed that this issue requires everybody’s attention, and that the competition was a tool to garner that attention. Dita explained that the organizing committee received 18 videos from contestants from various parts of the country including Jakarta, Depok, Cilacap, Riau and Yogyakarta. The committee gave participants the freedom to choose their own format and style. Some chose a documentary while others used symbolism to express their ideas. Dita acknowledged the high quality of the videos in the competition, and said the spirit evident in the submissions may be due to the fact that for many of the contestants this was the first or second video they had ever created. “They feel the same concerns and decided to voice it through the competition,” she told The Jakarta Post recently. Dita said three videos had been selected out of eight semifinalists as the winners of the competition. Fried rice, cold sodas and hot coffee accompanied the competition winners announcement at an outdoor restaurant in West Pejaten, South Jakarta. The first winner was Hernaidi Sidharta of Cilacap, who created a piece about discrimination. Hernaidi, who was represented by activist Insan Indah Pribadi, was awarded Rp 6 million (US$620) and a trophy. Hernaidi, who is now studying in Bandung, told of his own life as a Chinese-Indonesian who had been laughed at and sometimes bullied because of his ethnicity. Insan said the video was entirely Hernaidi’s idea and was the fruit of months of practice as part of the Sangkanparan multimedia community in Cilacap, a place where he and other activists facilitate multimedia training for the local youth. Now, according to Insan, there was surge in interest to study multimedia, including how to produce videos that could have an impact. He said there was a good precedent that boosted local youth’s motivation to study multimedia platforms when a group of youth who recorded road damage near their housing complex managed to get the local authorities’ attention, the damage eventually fixed. “The video was able to cut through the chains of bureaucracy and therefore the local authorities fixed the problem after watching the video. This was a good precedent,” he said. The other winners were Rikky Muchammad Fajar, an LGBT (Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender) rights activist and Luvie Melati from the Depok Blogger Community, each earning Rp 2.5 million and trophies. Rikky produced a documentary about the police who did nothing when an “Indonesia without FPI [Islamic Defenders Front]” rally turned chaotic at the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle. “The police, who are expected to be able to guarantee citizen safety, turned a blind eye when the demonstrators were attacked,” he said. He said the video had also been used as supporting evidence by the police when they investigated the incident later. Luvie Melati from the Depok Blogger Community said they had chosen to present their ideas by using simple toys as symbols in order to be understood. Besides receiving money and trophies, the winners were also given a two-day master class with noted video makers Ucu Agustin and Lexy Junior Rambadeta who shared their experiences and tips and tricks with the finalists. Lexy acknowledged the creativity of the contestants demonstrated through the variety of formats used. “Each video has convincing storytelling and strong pictures. This has been a good beginning for all contestants,” he said. But he warned the finalists to safeguard their creations so they wouldn’t be lost in the future. Documentary film enthusiasts like him, he said, always wanted to know what would happen with the characters in the video like Hernaidi “Achong” Sidharta or the activists during the anti-FPI rally in the future. Dita said Engage Media intended to feature all the finalist’s videos on their website so anyone with an interest could view the videos for free.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/12/28/digital-video-makers-defending-pluralism.html,,2012

"Mon, December 1, 2014",FPI now only spreading hatred rather than credible opinion: NGO,"The MAARIF Institute, a leading campaigner for Islamic pluralism within Indonesia, condemned on Monday the move by the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) to inaugurate its own 'ÄúJakarta governor'Äù as a narrow-minded civic action. 'ÄúIn terms of freedom of speech, the FPI has the right to voice its opinions. However, what I have noticed is that it offers no explanation other than political and sectarian hatred,'Äù executive director Fajar Riza Ul-Haq said in a media statement on Monday. 'ÄúThis point of view ruins the structure of democracy because people are provoked to disobey the rules that have been agreed upon.'Äù Fajar added that the FPI'Äôs actions simply spread ethnic, religious and racial sentiments that threatened to disrupt the foundations of statehood, which are based on principles of diversity. The FPI inaugurated Fahrurrozi Ishak as its self-proclaimed governor in opposition to official Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama. The FPI called on all Jakartans to recognize Fahrurrozi, leader of the Jakarta Community Movement (GMJ), as the rightful governor of Jakarta. Fajar, a member of Indonesia'Äôs second largest Islamic organization Muhammadiyah, said that the FPI'Äôs actions showed its narrow-mindedness in not recognizing the standard procedures and democratic values that surrounded Ahok'Äôs inauguration as Jakarta governor in late November. He added that the actions of a number of Jakarta City Council (DPRD) deputy speakers were disappointing and exacerbated the situation by supporting the FPI'Äôs point of view based on political reasons. 'ÄúThe coalition rivalry in the House of Representatives is used as ammunition to delegitimize Ahok as Jakarta governor. The Jakarta City Council must focus on supervising Jakarta'Äôs development under Ahok rather than being carried away by political intricacies that could degrade our democratic qualities,'Äù Fajar said.

"Thu, November 13, 2014",FPI files report against Ahok for defamation,"The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) filed a police report on Wednesday against acting governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama after he submitted official letters to the home and law and human rights ministries recommending that the notorious hard-line organization be disbanded. FPI lawyer Sugito Atmo Pawiro said the organization filed a report with the Jakarta Police headquarters in South Jakarta against Ahok for defamation and improper conduct according to articles 310 and 335 of the Criminal Code. 'ÄúAhok abused his authority by sending that recommendation letter to the ministries. He'Äôs the only one who seems to have a problem with the FPI just because the group does not agree with him being sworn in as governor,'Äù he said while showing reporters media clippings of Ahok'Äôs statements on the FPI. Articles 310 and 335 carry maximum prison sentences of nine months and one year, respectively. On Tuesday, Ahok sent a recommendation letter after relentless protests over several weeks by the FPI against his upcoming inauguration. The acting governor complained that the FPI staged protests against him because he was a Christian and as such were against the Constitution. He added that the FPI'Äôs actions of intolerance were an affront to Islam and the Muslim community. One of the FPI'Äôs most violent protest against Ahok happened early last month. More than a dozen police officers were injured after FPI members threw rocks and manure at them. The police then arrested more than 20 FPI members, including senior members Novel Bamu'Äômin and Shahabudin Anggawi, for property damage and provocation. Sugito explained that Ahok'Äôs bias against the FPI was apparent, especially in regard to the most recent protest against him, which was held on Monday. Although the protest was organized by the Jakarta Community Movement (GMJ), Ahok still decided to pin the blame on the FPI, who only made up a small part of the protestors, Sugito claimed. Ahok played down the hard-line group'Äôs filing of a police against him. 'ÄúIt is up to them. I don'Äôt care. I just want to work,'Äù he said. Ahok said he would not file a counter report against the FPI as he was too busy. He added that he would not interfere with the home minister'Äôs decision regarding his proposal to disband the group.

In the letter, Ahok'Äôs reasons supporting the disbandment of the FPI included the group'Äôs anarchic demeanor, its spreading of hate, its attempt to halt his inauguration as governor of Jakarta through hateful means and purposefully creating traffic jams to the disadvantage of the people. The FPI has staged three massive rallies in the last three months against Ahok'Äôs upcoming governorship, mainly on the grounds that he is a Christian of Chinese descent.

Thousands of protesters from several Islamic organizations, including the FPI, who claimed to represent the majority of Jakarta'Äôs residents, staged a demonstration in front of City Hall and yelled insults at Ahok, such as 'ÄúAhok is the devil'Äôs spawn!'Äù and 'ÄúArrogant Ahok must be ousted!'Äù Ahok says FPI'Äôs intolerance, use of violence in name of Islam are against Constitution Letter recommending disbandment of FPI will be filed with Law and Human Rights Ministry A number of demonstrators, including FPI chairman Muhammad Rizieq Shihab, were received by Abraham 'ÄúLulung'Äù Lunggana and Muhammad Taufik, two City Council deputy speakers from the United Development Party (PPP) and the Gerindra Party. During the meeting, Lulung and Taufik expressed their support for the demonstration and its demand that the government not swear in Ahok as the new governor. 'ÄúWe agree that Ahok must not be sworn in as governor. Ahok has a bad reputation, not just in the eyes of city councilors but also the Jakarta public. I'Äôm glad that all Jakartans also reject Ahok. He is the source of all problems,'Äù Lulung said when he joined the protest. The FPI has demonstrated several times at City Hall and the City Council building to protest against Ahok being sworn in. During their protest early last month at the City Council, the FPI members threw rocks at the police and Public Order Agency (Satpol PP) officers who were guarding the building. About a dozen police officers were injured and more than 10 FPI members were arrested. Meanwhile, the National Police declined to recommend disbanding the hard-line organization because they said they did not have enough authority to assess such organizations. National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Ronny F. Sompie stressed that it was the authority of the Home Ministry and the Law and Human Rights Ministry to recognize or disband mass organizations. 'ÄúThe Home Ministry is tasked with supervising mass organizations, while the Law and Human Rights Ministry devises the regulations ['Ä_] The National Police have no authority to disband [an organization]. The ministries should not wait for our recommendation, if they want, they can ask for the data right away,'Äù he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/11/11/acting-governor-ahok-propose-disbanding-fpi.html,,2014
"Mon, November 10, 2014",Ahok to hand over FPI disbandment recommendation letter to ministry,"Acting Jakarta Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama has said he will hand over a recommendation letter on the disbandment of the Islamic Defenders front (FPI) hardline group to the Law and Human Rights Ministry on Monday. Ahok explained that he had already coordinated the delivery of the recommendation letter with Jakarta Legal Bureau head Sri Rahayu. 'ÄúHopefully many governors, regents and mayors across the nation would follow my lead in submitting letters calling for a nationwide disbandment of FPI that is in line with the 2013 Social Organization Groups law,'Äù said Ahok on Monday as quoted by kontan.co.id. According to the 2013 Social Groups Law, the disbandment of a civil organization can be carried out by the Law and Human Rights Ministry through a trial, which would involve police reports and evidence, which is aimed at imposing sanctions for the organization. An organization which has been subjected to such trials is able to be sanctioned with a warning, suspension or disbandment. Around 2,000 members of the FPI held another massive demonstration on Monday at the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle protesting Ahok'Äôs upcoming governorship of Jakarta, making it the hardline group'Äôs third demonstration in three months. During a mass protest in October, 16 police officers were injured after the protesting FPI members hurled rocks and manure at the officers who were attempting to keep the protestors at bay. As a result, the FPI riot coordinators were subsequently arrested, including two senior FPI figures Novel Bamu'Äômin and Shahabudin Anggawi. Also on Monday, as many as 3,000 workers, including members of the Confederation of Indonesian Labor Unions, staged a rally in the same vicinity as the FPI demonstrators, demanding an increase of the minimum wage in Jakarta and more generous benefits. Former Jakarta Governor and current Indonesian president Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo raised the minimum wage from Rp 2.2 million [US$181] to Rp 2.4 million earlier this year.

"Mon, November 10, 2014",Rizieq leads FPI protest rally against Ahok,"The hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) has once again staged a rally to protest against the appointment of deputy governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'ÄùTjahaja Purnama, who is a Christian of Chinese descent, as Jakarta governor. According to Antara news agency the FPI rally was led by chairman Muhammad Rizieq Shihab. Jakarta Police spokesperson Sr. Comr. Rikwanto said there were around 2,000 FPI members at the rally. He added that the police, the Indonesian Military (TNI) and Jakarta Public Order Agency (Satpol PP) had mobilized 1,000 personnel to secure the rally, which caused traffic congestion around the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle in Central Jakarta. On Oct. 3, an FPI rally turned into a riot that left 16 police officers injured and several cars damaged. The coordinators of the rally, Shahabudin Anggawi and Novel Bamu'Äômin, who are high-ranking FPI members, have been arrested by the Jakarta Police.

"Fri, October 31, 2014",Ahok gets nod from Muslim leaders,"A qori (Muslim scholar) recited Koran verses during the commemoration of the Islamic New Year at City Hall on Wednesday, while acting governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian of Chinese descent, listened attentively. During his speech, Ahok asked more than 100 Muslim clerics from across the capital to encourage youngsters to visit mosques more often. The former regent of East Belitung, a majority Muslim population, said that mosques were places for the teaching of virtues. 'ÄúAnd mosques should be free of political agendas,'Äù he added. Ahok also encouraged youngsters to not only learn how to read the Koran, but to understand the messages behind them. 'ÄúWe want children to have read and understood the entirety of the Koran by the time they are 12 years old. This is your task, Muslim leaders,'Äù he told the audience. In a move to prove that he was onboard, Ahok also said the city would be willing to procure land around small mosques to provide adequate space for expansion. 'ÄúBigger spaces can accommodate more people, especially during mass prayers during Islamic holidays,'Äù he said. With bigger spaces, he continued, the city administration would be able provide various amenities, including free Wi-Fi and mobile libraries to encourage youngsters to stick around after prayers. 'ÄúI hope this way the youngsters will want to go to the mosque before they hang out at the public park. Don'Äôt forget to pray before hanging out,'Äù he said. After former Jakarta governor and current President Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo 'Äî a Muslim-Javanese whom many deemed well equipped to unite different groups during his time as governor 'Äî left City Hall for the Presidential Palace, Ahok had to prove he was up to the task. During the fasting month of Ramadhan, Ahok regularly visited mosques and joined fast-breaking events in an attempt to shrug off allegations voiced by a number of groups that he neglected the voice of the Muslim community. A top city official is often called upon to participate in Koran recital events during the fasting month, regardless of his or her religion. To protest Ahok'Äôs inauguration as governor, which is expected next month, the hardline group Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) has vowed to stage rallies every Friday. A similar rally held by the FPI last month, however, degenerated into a violent riot, during which dozens of FPI members were arrested by the Jakarta Police. In a speech delivered during the commemoration event, Istiqlal Mosque Grand Imam Ali Musthafa Ya'Äôqub expressed his support for Ahok, saying that his appointment as the next leader of Jakarta was legitimate. 'ÄúWe have gone through the election. It is not the time for doing that again,'Äù Ali said, adding that expressing opposition to Ahok through rallies was acceptable as long as they did not involve violence. He also identified injustice, vested interests and indifference as the factors driving violence perpetrated in the name of Islam. 'ÄúMany interpreted the verses on war [against infidels] differently, making them think that the same interpretation could be applied during times of peace,'Äù Ali said. When asked whether the support expressed by the Istiqlal Mosque Grand Imam had put him at ease amid rejection by others, Ahok said, 'ÄúI have always felt secure, actually. Their support just assured me that this is the genuine face of Islam that I have known since I was a child.'Äù 'ÄúIf they believe that all non-Muslims should be killed in accordance with the Koran, then Prophet Muhammad should have killed his beloved uncle Abu Talib in the first place.'Äù",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/10/31/ahok-gets-nod-muslim-leaders.html,,2014
"Fri, October 24, 2014",Jakartans'Äô pluralism put to the test,"Jakartans'Äô sense of pluralism will be put to the test as the inauguration of a non-Muslim Jakarta governor draws near.  Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama is a Christian and also comes from a long-line of Chinese. Even though Jakarta already had a non-Muslim governor, Henk Ngantung, from 1964-1965, Henk, who was a native of Sulawesi, did not face the same kind of rejection that Ahok is experiencing today. Ahok'Äôs ethnic and religious background has been deemed problematic and unacceptable for someone becoming governor of the city by some groups such as the Betawi Brotherhood Forum (FBR) and especially by the hard-line Islamic group, the FPI (Islam Defenders Front). The FPI has already stated that it will oppose Ahok and that it was ready to take over City Hall if Ahok was officially sworn-in as the new Jakarta governor, replacing Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo, the new President. The FPI states that Jakarta should be led by a Muslim governor, because Jakarta is a Muslim-majority city. The FPI likes to point out that in Bali the majority of its residents are Hindu and the Bali governor is both Hindu and Balinese. FPI'Äôs rejection of Ahok and his upcoming inauguration as the new Jakarta governor became evident through their banners they displayed that said Ahok, being a Christian, would not be able to represent and incorporate the aspirations of Muslims living in Jakarta. One banner even read, 'ÄúThe Muslims of Jakarta do not need Ahok because Ahok and the words coming out his mouth are full of trash'Äù. Whether this brutal insult represents the opinion of the majority of Jakarta Muslims remains highly questionable, if not doubtful. Only time will tell how this eventful drama of 'Äúthe FPI vs Ahok'Äù will play out. However, if the Republic stands strong atop its ideals of democracy, pluralism and multi-culturalism, Ahok'Äôs inauguration as the new Jakarta governor should proceed smoothly. This would be solid proof that in Indonesia all citizens are granted the same rights and opportunities to be become high government officials, despite his or her religious or ethnic backgrounds. This would mean that the notion of social justice is not merely a theory in this country, but is a principle put to practice in daily life. Our founding fathers believed in social justice and that is why they made it a part of our state ideology, Pancasila. The fifth guiding principle regarding 'Äúsocial justice'Äù could not be more direct and clear in its instruction, reading: 'ÄúSocial justice for the whole people of Indonesia'Äù. Therefore, the FPI'Äôs rejection of Ahok'Äôs upcoming inauguration as the new governor due to his religion is clearly the same as rejecting the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia itself and all the principles and values it stands for. If the nation stands strong on the constitution then there should be no reason for anyone to deny the fact that in a few weeks time Jakarta will have a non-Muslim governor. Even though Ahok will not be the first non-Muslim governor of Jakarta, he is definitely the first one of his kind. The city needs a governor that is not afraid to stand up to anyone, whether notorious thugs in the Tanah Abang market area or the corrupt officials and bureaucrats that have been stealing from Jakarta'Äôs city budget for decades. If Ahok continues to work hard in the manner that he has been doing for the last few years, then it'Äôs likely that the majority of Jakartans will want him back as governor in 2017. Good luck, Pak Ahok! ___________________ The writer graduated from the faculty of social and political sciences, University of Indonesia.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/10/24/jakartans-pluralism-put-test.html,,2014
"Sun, October 19, 2014",View Point: Why temperamental Ahok needs a deputy,"Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama will rise to governor replacing Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo, who will be inaugurated as the republic'Äôs seventh president, on Monday. Because his promotion is constitutional, those who loathe him simply because he is of Chinese descent and a Christian, such as the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), will have to bow to the supremacy of the law and give way. Even though Jokowi officially resigned on Thursday, Ahok remains acting governor and, until he is sworn in, he is not able to make strategic decisions, such as signing a bylaw or starting a major development project. Forget about the lingering opposition from some fanatical groups with the apparent backing of politicians who worry that Ahok'Äôs governorship will jeopardize their business and political interests. The burning issue is who Ahok will pick as his deputy, or whether he will prefer to do without a deputy if the candidates fielded by political parties are not to his liking. The battle for the number-two position has stalled since Ahok rejected two candidates proposed by the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) and the Gerindra Party, the two political organizations that successfully nominated the Jokowi-Ahok ticket in the 2012 gubernatorial race. Ahok has good reason for his reluctance to consider Boy Sadikin, a senior PDI-P politician, since Boy was from the outset critical of the Jokowi-Ahok candidacy. While Muhammad Taufik, whom Gerindra has proposed, was convicted of graft in 2006 and has openly sought Ahok'Äôs removal after Ahok quit Gerindra in protest at the party'Äôs support for a controversial law revoking direct elections for local government heads. Ahok has come up with names of his own for his deputy; either Djarot Saiful Hidayat, a former mayor of Blitar, East Java, or Bambang Dwi Hartono, former deputy mayor of Surabaya. He believes they have proven integrity and experience. 'ÄúBut it'Äôs up to PDI-P [to decide],'Äù he says. In fact the 2004 law on regional administration allows a regional head to govern without a deputy. So Ahok has no legal obligation to submit names for his deputy if he thinks he cannot work with any of the candidates proposed by political parties. For a leader a deputy is an alter ego and therefore our law does not make it an obligation for regional government heads to have a deputy if they are confident they are able to accomplish their jobs without one, or if the candidates proposed to them are not suitable. There are cases that have shown that a pairing proposed by a third party can end up in conflict between the head of a local administration and their deputy. The then Banten governor Ratu Atut Chosiyah and her deputy Rano Karno, and Surabaya Mayor Risma Harini and Wisnu Sakti Buana are cases in point. Local leaders should, therefore, retain their freedom to pick their most trusted aides to provide for the best chemistry, and this is a privilege that political parties should leave to Ahok. But if he governs without a deputy who represents a major political party, such as the PDI-P, Ahok will have no support from political parties when confronting hostile factions in the City Council. The council is the den of his unforgiving political foes like Taufik and the notorious Abraham 'ÄúLulung'Äù Lunggana, allegedly the underworld kingpin of Tanah Abang Market, which Ahok is trying to reorganize. Ahok will need a deputy to lighten his enormous burden of shaking up the bureaucracy, solving the capital'Äôs acute urban woes like seasonal flooding, easing traffic, combating corruption and building new infrastructure 'Äî the election promises he has to honor. His abrasive, no-nonsense attitude has won him both enemies and friends within his bureaucracy and in the City Council, leaving people wondering if this characteristic is a strength or a weakness. He began to gain public trust for his sincerity in shaking up the bureaucracy when he uploaded to YouTube regular meetings with city bureaucrats. In one of the sessions, he was angry over shoddy projects. He has kept his word to fire underperforming personnel and make meritocracy the basis on which employees are promoted. Earlier this year, he closed down Stadium, a well-known discotheque in downtown Jakarta, for breaching drug laws. His daring action stunned both his critics and advocates because none of his predecessors had had the courage to do so. Never one to dodge a confrontation, he has always openly taken up his foes'Äô challenges. Recently, he sought to disband the FPI after its members staged a violent demonstration at his office that led to 20 arrests. His gruff manner made him an unlikely pairing with Jokowi, a soft-spoken Javanese who built his popularity by visiting slum areas and listening to people'Äôs grievances. Ahok has been proud to call Jokowi his 'Äúbrake'Äù to control his temper. Now that Jokowi has left, Ahok needs a confidant who not only can calm his emotions but also to help him deal with hostile religious groups and, most importantly, with City Council politicians who are more than ready to obstruct his plans and discredit him.

"Fri, October 17, 2014",Rising religious intolerance scars a democrat,"Not gonna take it: Demonstrators stage a protest in front of the House of Representatives compound in rejection of the government'Äôs plan to relocate Shia followers in Sampang, Madura to a refugee camp, following a clash with the local majority Sunni population in the area. JP/Ricky Yudhistira As home to more than 240 million people with diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds, Indonesia has experienced a long list of conflicts during the past decades, providing an indication that it has remained a fragile nation despite its status as Southeast Asia'Äôs biggest economy and democracy. Therefore, the public put very high hopes on Democratic Party chief patron Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono after he won the country'Äôs first-ever direct presidential election in 2004. The retired Army general had been expected to not only consolidate democracy after the fall of President Suharto'Äôs authoritarian government and lead the economic recovery following the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis but also to restore national stability after a series of religious conflicts in Central Sulawesi, Maluku and West Kalimantan, as well as bombing incidents in Bali and Jakarta that took place between the late 1990s and early 2000s. Yudhoyono, as the country'Äôs first democratic leader, however, has not proved himself the messiah of minority groups in the country. Reports and data have suggested that Yudhoyono has shown very low commitment to defending their religious rights during his 10 years in office. Instead, he tends to make them a potential target of intimidation through the issuance of controversial rulings and policies. Among the contentious rulings is a 2006 joint ministerial decree stipulating congregation members secure approval from at least 60 local residents of different faiths and the government-sponsored Regional Interfaith Communication Forum (FKUB) before establishing a house of worship. Activists have strongly condemned this decree as it is getting very difficult for religious minorities to build their house of worship since the FKUB, or the local administration, often reject applications if even the slightest objection is raised, particularly if those objecting are Muslims, who make up about 90 percent of the country'Äôs population. Locals and members of radical Muslim organizations have also considered the issuance of a 2008 joint decree by the Religious Affairs Ministry, the Home Ministry and the Attorney General'Äôs Office that bans Ahmadiyah followers from spreading their beliefs as justification to launch a series of attacks on members of the religious sect in the past years. A combination of the discriminative rulings and law enforcers'Äô reluctance to prosecute members of hard-line organizations committing violence against religious minorities has inevitably contributed to an increasing number of violent acts against religions during Yudhoyono'Äôs leadership. Religious freedom watchdog Setara Institute, for example, reported that there had been 135 cases of religion-based violence across the country in 2007. The number rose to 244 in 2011 and 264 in 2012. Meanwhile, the Wahid Institute recorded 92 cases of religious freedom violations and 184 incidents of intolerance throughout 2012, rising from 64 and 134 cases, respectively, a year earlier. In its 2013 report In Religion'Äôs Name: Abuses against Religious Minorities in Indonesia, New York-based Human Rights Watch blames Yudhoyono for his slow response to the growing religious intolerance in the country. The President has most often deferred to others when pressed to address attacks on religious minorities. Too often, he has turned a blind eye to hard-line groups that engage in such attacks and has said little publicly when other government leaders, notably the Religious Affairs Minister, make discriminatory statements that fuel such antagonism, the report says. The executive director of public policy think tank The Indonesian Institute, Raja Juli Antoni, has also questioned Yudhoyono'Äôs trivial moves when responding to violent acts targeting religious minorities. When two Christians in Bekasi, West Java, were attacked by Islam Defenders Front (FPI) members in 2010 following conflict over a church establishment, Yudhoyono instructed the health minister to visit the victims and provide them with free medical treatment. 'ÄúThis move was meaningless since it did not address the root cause behind the attack,'Äù Raja recently told The Jakarta Post in an interview. Despite public criticism of his relatively poor record in handling religious intolerance, Yudhoyono was awarded last year with the World Statesmen Award from New York-based interfaith organization the Appeal of Conscience Foundation (ACF). In a speech during the award ceremony, Yudhoyono stressed his commitment to eradicating religious intolerance. 'ÄúAs we move forward, we will not tolerate any act of senseless violence committed by any group in the name of religion. We will not allow any desecration of places of worship of any religion for whatever reason. We will always protect our minorities and ensure that no one suffers from discrimination,'Äù he said. The Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence (Kontras), however, sees the central government'Äôs discriminative treatment of religious minorities as having reached an alarming level as it has inspired local governments to do the same thing. Kontras, for instance, recorded that 21 bylaws had been issued by regional governments between 2005 and 2011 to disband any religious activities by Ahmadiyah sect members, putting the Ahmadis under continuous threat from locals and radical organizations. 'ÄúDiscrimination against minority groups is running consistently under Yudhoyono'Äôs leadership, as he has been too lenient toward uncivilized mass organizations that commit violent acts and spread hatred against minority groups,'Äù Kontras coordinator Haris Azhar said. Prominent violent acts targeting religious minorities (2004-2014) * July 15, 2005 Thousands of people attack the Ahmadiyah school and headquarters in Parung, Bogor, West Java, in a protest against the group'Äôs teachings. * June 1, 2008 Members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) attack activists of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion when the latter staged a rally at the National Monument (Monas) park in Jakarta to show support for the Ahmadiyah minority sect, leaving dozens of people injured. * Dec. 25, 2009 Revelers marking the Islamic New Year attack the under-construction St. Albertus Church in the Harapan residential complex in Bekasi, West Java.

"Wed, October 15, 2014",FPI rejects interfaith marriage at MK,"Amid increasing calls to disband the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) for its record of violence, the hard-line Islamic group was permitted to present arguments during a hearing in the Marriage Law judicial review case at the Constitutional Court (MK) on Tuesday. The FPI had earlier asked the court for the opportunity to present arguments concerning Article 2 of the Marriage Law that stipulates that marriage ceremonies should be conducted according to religious teachings. The judicial review was filed by three graduates and one current student from the University of Indonesia'Äôs School of Law. FPI lawyer Mirza Zulkarnain said it was important for religion to regulate the act of marriage. 'ÄúIf the legality of a marriage is based merely on a civil contract, it is not marriage, but merely a kumpul kebo [cohabitation] agreement.'Äù Chief justice Hamdan Zoelva confirmed that the court had permitted the FPI'Äôs participation in the hearing as the group possessed the right to be heard as 'Äúa related party'Äù in the case. He added that the court had requested the participation of other relevant parties, including the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), Muhammadiyah 'Äî which is the nation'Äôs second-largest Muslim organization 'Äî as well as the House of Representatives. Positioning itself as a Muslim interest group, over the years the FPI has been implicated in a number of violent attacks against those whom it often labels 'Äúinfidels'Äù. The latest incident involves a violent demonstration against Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama, whose leadership the group rejects because he is a Christian of Chinese descent. In another incident in 2013, a resident was killed and three others injured during a clash between FPI members and residents of Sukorejo, Kendal, Central Java, that broke out after residents tried to prevent FPI Temanggung branch members from conducting a vigilante sweep of the village'Äôs red-light district during the fasting month of Ramadhan. The Marriage Law neither sanctions nor outlaws unions between couples of differing religious backgrounds, nor does it stipulate that only couples of the same religious background can register their marriages with civil authorities. Article 2'Äôs ambiguity, however, fuels opposition to interfaith marriages, prompting the judicial review, which seeks to secure greater legal certainty for interfaith unions. Representing the government in the hearing, head of the Religious Affairs Ministry'Äôs research and development division, Muhammad Machasin, said that in a country upholding the ideology of Pancasila and a belief in one God, it was a Constitutional right to respect marriage. 'ÄúIt is clear that upholding constitutional rights necessitates an obligation to respect the rights of others,'Äù he said. Separately, Hendardi, chairman of human rights watchdog, the Setara Institute, praised the court for granting the FPI an opportunity to be heard regardless of its history of violent intolerance of others. Hendardi said he hoped the FPI would learn from the example set by the court to respect others'Äô rights and forsake violent intimidation of dissenting views. 'ÄúThe government and the court must treat everyone equally,'Äù Hendardi said. 'Äú[The FPI] has been heard [at the court] in a democratic way. Therefore, it should learn that [in Indonesia] it must respect others and channel its beliefs in a democratic way.'Äù",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/10/15/fpi-rejects-interfaith-marriage-mk.html,,2014

Sutarman said on Friday that he supported the disbandment of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI). Sutarman said that the Jakarta Police had submitted a recommendation to the Law and Human Rights Ministry to disband the organization, a decision made only a week after the police arrested 20 members of the FPI during a protest outside City Hall that turned violent.

A number of FPI members were then detained at the Jakarta Police headquarters, including FPI secretary-general Novel Bamu'Äômin, who turned himself in after being on the run for almost a week. Novel, who was allegedly the mastermind of last week'Äôs demonstration, could face six years'Äô imprisonment for provoking others to violate laws under Article 160 of the Criminal Code. Another high-ranking FPI member, Shahabudin Anggawi, could face the same sentence. In the wake of the incident, Ahok has said that community organizations that promote violence such as the FPI should be disbanded. Ahok said that only the police had ability to disband the FPI because even outgoing President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was powerless against it. Sutarman said that even after the police submitted its recommendation for the disbandment of the FPI to the Home Ministry, the final decision would be in the hands of court judges. 'ÄúThe Jakarta Police can only submit a recommendation, the final say is with the court,'Äù Sutarman said. Article 70, paragraph 1 of Law No. 17/2013 stipulates that the disbandment of a mass organization can only carried out by a district court based on a written request from the Law and Human Rights Minister. Commenting on the FPI'Äôs violent protest, president-elect Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo has said that he will enforce the law on any community organization that provoked unrest. 'ÄúThose who violate regulations will be punished,'Äù he said. Earlier on Friday, FPI representatives met with members of the City Council and vowed to continue holding protests in front of the council building every Friday until Ahok steps down from office. 'ÄúWe will stand here every Friday in protest until Ahok resigns from his post,'Äù said Jafar Shodiq, one of FPI members attending the meeting.

"Fri, October 10, 2014",FPI leads another rally against Ahok,"Despite criticism that their rally was just a way of looking for trouble, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) insisted on organizing another rally in the front of the Jakarta City Council. This time, the FPI also invited women, children and the elderly. This week'Äôs rally had the same mission as last week'Äôs, rejecting the appointment of deputy governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama as Jakarta governor. The FPI vowed it would continue organizing rallies until their demands were met. During the rally, the FPI protested that Ahok, who is a Christian of Chinese descent, had repeatedly offended the Muslim majority. According to kompas.com, there were around 100 participants, many of whom were women and the elderly, at the rally. Traffic congestion was unavoidable in the vicinity, affecting Jl. Menteng Raya, Jl. Kebon Sirih and Jl. Agus Salim. Central Jakarta Police chief Sr. Comr. Hendro Pandowo said as many as 400 police personnel had been deployed to secure the rally. Last week'Äôs FPI rally turned sour and ended in clashes with the police, injuring more than 10 police officers. The police then arrested several FPI field coordinators for further questioning.

Antara/Ridwan Fuad The Jakarta Police arrested the hard-line group Islam Defenders Front'Äôs (FPI) secretary-general, Novel Bamu'Äômin, on Thursday. He is suspected of organizing last Friday'Äôs violent protest in front of City Hall in Central Jakarta. 'ÄúHe has been detained for further investigation into his role as one of the coordinators of last Friday'Äôs demonstration,'Äù Jakarta Police chief detective of general crimes Sr. Comr. Heru Pranoto told reporters. Heru said that Novel might face a maximum sentence of six years'Äô imprisonment for provoking others to violate laws under Article 160 of the Criminal Code. Besides Novel, the Jakarta Police have named 21 FPI members as suspects. However, this has not deterred them from protesting. Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto said members of the FPI and the Islamic People'Äôs Forum (FUI) were scheduled to demonstrate at the Jakarta Legislative Council in Central Jakarta to protest again against Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama being sworn in as Jakarta governor. 'ÄúThere are around 200 men and women scheduled to protest there Friday,'Äù he said. Novel had turned himself in at 3 p.m. Wednesday, Heru said, and was questioned for around nine hours at the directorate of general crimes. The questioning continued the next day and the police decided to detain him by 1 p.m. Thursday. The Jakarta Police had been looking for Novel since Saturday and sent wanted posters to all police precincts under their jurisdiction on Wednesday. Heru said that Novel had been moving from one place to another within Jakarta. Another high-ranking FPI member, Shahabudin Anggawi, who turned himself in last Saturday after being named a suspect, may also face the same charge as Novel. He had also been arrested by the police. Novel and Shahabudin were named in the FPI'Äôs protest announcement sent to the police as the coordinators of the protest against the appointment of Ahok, a Protestant of Chinese descent, as governor to replace outgoing Governor Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo, who will be inaugurated as president on Oct. 20. The protest turned into a riot and left 16 police officers injured and damaged several cars. Ahok himself challenged the police to disband the FPI due to their repeated violent acts and revealed that the Jakarta-based FPI was not registered as a community organization with the city'Äôs administration'Äôs National and Political Unity Office (Kesbangpol). However, several activists have protested the association between the FPI'Äôs criminal acts and the freedom of organization. Fransisca Fitri, the coordinator of the Freedom of Association Coalition (KKB) said that charging the suspects with the code was enough of a sanction to punish them. Whether or not an organization was registered at Kesbangpol had no connection with the violent acts conducted by the FPI, she said.

"Wed, October 8, 2014",Police respond to Ahok'Äôs challenge to ban FPI,"In an evident response to Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama'Äôs challenge to police to disband the notorious Islam Defenders Front (FPI), the National Police announced on Tuesday that they were preparing a recommendation to ban the organization. Speaking to reporters at City Hall in Central Jakarta on Tuesday, Ahok revealed that the Jakarta-based FPI was not registered as a community organization with the city administrations'Äô National and Political Unity Office (Kesbangpol). Ahok also claimed that he possessed a copy of the FPI'Äôs permit issued by the Home Ministry that expired in December 2013. The Home Ministry has denied Ahok'Äôs claim, arguing that the permit was valid until 2019. Ahok said only the police had the ability to disband the violent group because even outgoing President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was powerless against the FPI. 'ÄúAll community organizations that practice anarchy must be dissolved [...] moreover its permit from the Home Ministry has expired and it does not have a permit from the Jakarta Kesbangpol,'Äù said Ahok, who will replace Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo as Jakarta governor later this month. Ahok is among very few government officials who have dared to take a confrontational approach toward the organization, as most public officials, including police generals, tend to avoid confronting any problems with the FPI. The FPI staged a protest on Saturday in front of the Jakarta Legislative Council (DPRD) office in Central Jakarta to protest Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent, being sworn in as Jakarta governor. The protestors threw animal feces and rocks at police officers, injuring 10 officers. The police said FPI supporters had arrived at the scene with the stones and the feces. The protest turned violent and 22 FPI members were arrested and declared suspects. Seventeen of them were initially detained at the Jakarta Police headquarters in South Jakarta, including senior FPI member Shahabudin Anggawi. Four of them have since been released because they were minors, while FPI secretary-general Novel Bamu-min is still on the run, Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto said. 'ÄúWe have sent a wanted notice to all the police offices under our jurisdiction. Anyone who knows the whereabouts of Habib NV [Novel] should report to the police immediately,'Äù Rikwanto told reporters in Jakarta on Tuesday. Meanwhile, National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Ronny F. Sompie said the force would submit a recommendation to be taken into consideration by the Home Ministry when it assesses the possible disbandment of the FPI nationwide. 'ÄúWe will start deliberating the recommendation after the court hands down verdicts on the suspects [members of FPI Jakarta branch]. The rulings will be taken into consideration when compiling the recommendation,'Äù he said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. Separately, Home Ministry spokesman Dodi Riatmadji acknowledged the FPI'Äôs violent protest last week and said the ministry would evaluate the police'Äôs recommendation, but added that dissolving a community organization required a long process.

During the rally, FPI protesters threw stones and attacked police officers using sharp weapons, causing injuries. The Jakarta Police arrested 21 FPI members and named them as suspects.

'ÄúHabib NV [Novel] is one of our suspects and we are locating his whereabouts to arrest him. He failed to meet our summons twice,'Äù Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto told reporters on Monday. Novel was named a suspect on Saturday alongside another high-ranking FPI member, Shahabudin Anggawi, who turned himself in for questioning and was detained after the police named him a suspect. Rikwanto explained that Shahabudin was also suspected of organizing last Friday'Äôs coordinated riot. Novel and Shahabudin were named in the FPI'Äôs protest announcement letter sent to the police as the coordinators of the protest against the appointment of Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama, a Protestant Christian of Chinese descent, as governor to replace outgoing Governor Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo, who will be inaugurated as president on Oct. 20. The protest turned into a riot after the protestors moved from the front of the City Council building to the City Hall area. The protesters armed themselves with bags of rocks and manure to throw at the police. The police also found a sword and sharpened bamboo on the protesters'Äô vehicles. The riot left 16 police officers injured and damaged several cars. The victims included Gambir precinct chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Putu Putera Sadana, who is still undergoing treatment for head injuries at Pelni Hospital in Central Jakarta. Apart from Novel and Shahabudin, Rikwanto said, the police had named 19 other suspects, 16 of whom had been detained at the Jakarta Police headquarters in South Jakarta. Four of them were released because they were minors. 'ÄúMost of the people who protested came from outside Jakarta. They received a broadcast message asking for support for last Friday'Äôs protest. This message was received in many of their branches around Java,'Äù Rikwanto said. If the suspects were found guilty, he said, they could face a maximum prison sentence of five years for fighting officers, under Article 214 of the Criminal Code. Rikwanto said that the suspects could also face charges under articles 170, 160 and 406 of the code for collective property damage and provocation. The riot was the second protest held by the hard-line group this month. The police refused to take sterner action against FPI members involved in the first protest because no obvious violence had taken place, although many threats were uttered against Ahok and other Jakartans of Chinese descent.

The police are still searching for another FPI rally coordinator, Habib Novel Bamu'Äômin. Rikwanto added that the police were still investigating FPI chairman Habib Rizieq over his alleged role in Friday'Äôs protests.

FPI is notorious for using violence to 'Äúreinforce Islamic teachings.'Äù However, not many of the cases end up in court. Some of the cases that caused its members in various parts of the country to have been jailed for involvement in violent acts included an attack on a peace rally in Jakarta in 2008 when FPI chairman Habib Rizieq was sentenced to 18 months in prison.

(JP/DON) The recent power struggle among political elites may have spilled out onto the street on Friday, as a hardline group with informal ties to defeated presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto held a rally in front of Jakarta City Hall that erupted into what police believe was a coordinated riot. The Jakarta City Police have arrested at least 20 members of the group, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), following a protest at the City Hall compound on Jl. Medan Merdeka Selatan in Central Jakarta on Friday. More than 10 police officers, including the Gambir Police Precinct chief, were injured, while a number of cars were damaged after hundreds of protesters waving FPI flags threw rocks of considerable size toward the City Council building. A nearby Transjakarta bus shelter was vandalized and several luxury cars belonging to city council members were damaged. The FPI had rallied in opposition to Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian of Chinese descent, objecting to his religious affiliation and ethnic background. Later this month, Ahok will replace president-elect and outgoing Jakarta Governor Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo. FPI chairman Habib Rizieq apparently refuses to turn over alleged ringleaders Gerindra thanks FPI for the rally The FPI has publicly repudiated Ahok, claiming to speak for all Muslim Jakartans when they said they did not wish to be led by a Christian leader 'Äî a tenuous claim as the group has no credibility to speak for the larger Muslim community in Jakarta or elsewhere. The group also took issue with the fact that Ahok, as governor, would automatically head a number of Islamic organizations in Jakarta. Jokowi was not present at City Hall during the protest and Ahok was in South Korea attending the closing ceremony of the Asian Games. Jakarta City Police chief Insp. Gen. Unggung Cahyono said that the FPI had engineered the rally to end in violence as the protesters 'Äî several of whom had traveled from Bandung, Majalengka and Tasikmalaya in West Java to attend 'Äî arrived with rocks in their trucks. 'ÄúIt'Äôs not a spontaneous [violent protest],'Äù said Unggung, who later led at least 200 officers to cordon off FPI headquarters on Jl.

FPI chairman Habib Rizieq apparently refused to turn over Shahab and Novel to the police, instead giving up their assistant, Irwan. 'ÄúWe'Äôre still negotiating with Habib [Rizieq],'Äù said Unggung, who was installed as police chief in early September. The FPI has acquired a reputation for carrying out violent vigilante acts to 'Äúreinforce Islamic teachings'Äù. Gerindra Party Jakarta chairman and council deputy speaker M. Taufik, who once served several years in prison for graft, thanked the group for holding the rally and promised that he would do whatever was necessary to end Ahok'Äôs career. 'ÄúAhok is to blame for this violence,'Äù Taufik said. The FPI supported Prabowo, Gerindra'Äôs patron, during the recent presidential election. Gerindra'Äôs anger toward Ahok stemmed from the latter'Äôs recent decision to resign from Gerindra in protest at the party'Äôs support of a regional election law that scrapped direct elections for governors, mayors and regents. Prabowo and his brother, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, have vented their resentment at Ahok publicly, calling him a 'Äújumping louse'Äù for his purported penchant for changing parties. The FPI protests, however, may not be limited to a repudiation of Ahok'Äôs background and fitness to lead, as the group demanded Ahok retract a statement calling councilors who supported indirect elections 'Äúextorters'Äù.

On Friday evening, police officers, led by Jakarta Police chief Insp. Gen. Unggung Cahyono, descended upon FPI headquarters in Petamburan, Central Jakarta, to apprehend the suspects.

Both men have been brought to Jakarta Police headquarters for further questioning.

"Fri, October 3, 2014","Indonesian Islam promoted as moderate, peaceful","A scholar, a poet and a comedian shared their opinions about what constitutes Indonesian Islam and how it differs from that adhered to by fundamentalists. During the discussion 'ÄúUnderstanding Islam'Äù at the Ubud Writers & Readers Festival 2014 on Thursday, the three speakers promoted Islam in Indonesia as 'Äúmoderate'Äù, saying hardliners were only a tiny minority among those who upheld tolerance and peace in this country with its diverse religions. In the post-9/11 world, Islam has been both accused and staunchly defended across borders. A prominent Muslim scholar known for his moderate views, Azyumardi Azra, pointed out that Indonesian Islam was different from elsewhere, including the Middle East. 'ÄúIndonesian Islam is different from other places, including the Middle East. The absolute majority is moderate, and has been used to living with adherents of other religions peacefully for centuries without any bloodshed,'Äù said Azra, who is known for his firm opposition to the persecution of the Indonesian minority Ahmadiyah and Shia groups. 'ÄúOf course, there are isolated cases of Islamic communal conflicts, but that is usually related to politics,'Äù he added, citing a conflict in Sampang, Madura. The professor, who strongly opposed the adoption of sharia into Indonesian law, added that fundamentalists were present in the country as tiny minority groups, like the ones who twice bombed Bali, but they basically gained their hard-line principles elsewhere, not from Indonesia. However, he stressed, although Indonesian Islam was 'Äúcolorful and flexible'Äù, that did not mean that Muslims here were less Islamic or not loyal in implementing Islamic practices. Poet Goenawan Mohamad, who supports the Islamic Liberal Network (JIL), shared his experience on being a liberal Muslim. The founder and editor of Tempo magazine said his views, which were similar to some prominent Muslim figures known for their pluralistic and moderate beliefs, like Nurcholis Madjid and Abdurrahman Wahid, were that 'ÄúFaith is not like a fortress. That is why I choose to be a liberated Muslim'Äù. 'ÄúFundamentalists say we should not interpret Islam, but I think Islam is always an interpretation,'Äù said Goenawan, who marked his 70th birthday by republishing several of his works, including Marxisme, Seni, Pembebasan (Marxism, the Arts, Emancipation), Indonesia/Proses (Indonesia/Process) and Puisi dan Antipuisi (Poetry and Antipoetry). Regarding the growing concerns about Islamic State (IS) movement, Azra commented, 'ÄúIt is basically a Middle Eastern Islamic phenomenon, not from Indonesia where Islam is moderate, accommodative and peaceful.'Äù Meanwhile, Goenawan said that IS was 'Äúa threat for everyone, not only for Muslims, because they kill people'Äù.

'ÄúI wore a hijab for six years, but now I'Äôm more Islam KTP,'Äù she said wittily referring to a Muslim who does not really practice Islam in their daily life but is recorded as Muslim on their identity card.

"Thu, September 25, 2014",FPI threatens Chinese Indonesians,"The hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) launched threats against minority groups during a rally on Wednesday opposing Deputy Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama, who is to replace current Governor and president-elect Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo. Hundreds of FPI members marched to the City Council building on Jl. Kebon Sirih, Central Jakarta, located in the same compound as City Hall, causing several hours of traffic gridlock in the area. The group'Äôs opposition is based on Ahok'Äôs alleged insensitivity regarding issues of ethnicity, religion and race. Ahok is a Christian of Chinese descent. While entering the City Council, one FPI member shouted 'ÄúIf [Ahok] dares to challenge us Betawi people even once, I will not sit still. I'Äôll rid Jakarta of all its ethnic Chinese residents!'Äù Another member responded with 'ÄúKill Ahok!'Äù During a meeting between representatives of the FPI and the City Council, FPI Jakarta chapter head Salim Al Athas, popularly known as Habib Selon, called on the City Council not to inaugurate Ahok as governor. 'ÄúAhok does not deserve to lead Jakarta because it is a majority Muslim city. Moreover, he is arrogant. He insulted civil servants who were older than him for failing to perform well. He'Äôs the one who should be insulted,'Äù Salim told the forum. FPI secretary-general Novel Bamu'Äômin later read out the group'Äôs stance, which lists 20 'Äúsins'Äù committed by Ahok. The group takes issue with the fact that Ahok, as governor, would automatically head a number of Islamic organizations in Jakarta. 'ÄúHis religion causes anxiety among Muslims [...] Ahok has used his authority to carry out Christianization through the open-call selection, whereby several Christian leaders were selected to lead Muslim-majority areas,'Äù Novel said. City Council speaker Prasetio Edi Marsudi of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) said that the Council leaders would discuss the group'Äôs complaints. Ahok played down the protest, saying 'ÄúI'Äôve had enough of such remarks. Why should I care?'Äù When asked whether or not he suspected a particular party of backing the protest, he answered, 'ÄúAsk the police to investigate who is actually sponsoring them.'Äù Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Rikwanto told The Jakarta Post that the police would continue to monitor the FPI'Äôs activities in case of any violations of the law. Rikwanto explained that the police would only take action if the FPI committed an obvious violation. Otherwise, the police would have to wait for a report to be filed.

He said that the police had instructed FPI to carry out a peaceful demonstration when the latter reported its plan to the authorities.

Jakarta Military District Command assistant for security and intelligence Col. Sony Aprianto said hundreds of residents had expressed their support for IS. 'ÄúWe recorded on March 16 that around 400 people rallied at the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle, showing their support for the Islamic State, while on July 6 about 800 people pledged allegiance to the Islamic State at the UIN [State Islamic University] Syarif Hidayatullah [in Ciputat, Tangerang],'Äù Sony said during an intelligence forum at City Hall on Friday. Sony added that the Indonesian Military'Äôs (TNI) Strategic Intelligence Agency (BAIS) and the National Intelligence Agency (BIN) had identified 60-80 Indonesians who had left Indonesia to fight in Syria. 'ÄúMost of them were members of Islamic organizations and students studying in Arab countries,'Äù he said. The agencies had identified organizations 'Äî mostly Islamic groups 'Äî operating in Indonesia who either supported or were against IS. 'ÄúIn the country, there are a number of groups that have expressed support for the movement, including [radical groups] Jamaah Islamiyah, the Islamic Sharia Activists Forum, Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid [JAT], led by [firebrand cleric] Abu Bakar Ba'Äôasyir, and Syam Mujahid. 'ÄúMeanwhile, groups who are against the Islamic State include [Islamic organization Nahdlatul Ulama'Äôs youth wing] GP Ansor, [Islamic organization] Muhammadiyah, ICMI [Associaton of Indonesian Muslim Intellectuals] and [hard-line group] the FPI [Islam Defenders Front],'Äù Sony said. He acknowledged that the rise in radicalism in Indonesia had encouraged people to join the global jihad. Sony also recommended the government block the passports of Indonesians leaving for Syria to join IS. 'ÄúWe must closely monitor Indonesians leaving for countries in conflict. We also call on religious leaders to enlighten their followers,'Äù he said. Deputy Jakarta Police chief Brig. Gen. Sujarno said the city police would disband any movement affiliated with IS. 'ÄúWe'Äôve carried out preventive measures by distributing leaflets on the Islamic State through Babinsa [village supervisory non-commissioned officers], Babin Kamtibmas [police public order officers] and neighborhood and community unit heads. We hope residents will involve themselves in prevention measures,'Äù he said. Sujarno also encouraged neighborhood unit leaders to monitor newcomers in their respective areas. 'ÄúWe should revive the rule that newcomers should report to the neighborhood unit head within 24 hours of arriving in a new area,'Äù he said. Sujarno said the police would impose the law, ranging from criminal to terrorism laws, on IS supporters in Indonesia. The leaflet distributed by the police mentioned Article 160 of the Criminal Code (KUHP) on provoking others to commit crimes or violate the law, with a maximum penalty of six years in jail, and Law No.15/2003 on terrorism. Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama declined to comment, leaving the matter to the security authorities.

"Mon, June 30, 2014",Ramadhan begins with a festive vibe,"Ghost town: Scores of people spend their time at the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle during Car Free Day in Jakarta on Sunday morning. Many people were surprised to see roads in the area empty on Sunday, which was also the first day of the fasting month Ramadhan. Usually, hundreds of thousands of Jakartans flock to Jl. MH Thamrin and Jl. Sudirman each Sunday for Car Free Day. JP/DON Sunday marked the first day of Ramadhan for the majority of Indonesia'Äôs 210 million Muslims. During the holy month, urban dwellers flock to the streets and malls to buy sweets or big meals to break their fast. Nearing sunset on the first day, streets were crowded with vendors preparing to cater to people breaking fast, and malls were crowded with families scrambling to find a venue to break fast with their loved ones. The usually crowded Jl. Rawa Belong in West Jakarta saw an even bigger crowd on Sunday as street vendors packed its sidewalks. Residents on motorcycles and in cars parked along the narrow street causing long-tailed traffic. Dozens of street vendors were selling a wide variety of foods and beverages. Iced fruit drinks proved to be popular with the many people eager to quench their thirst with a refreshing beverage before diving into big meals. Customers patiently waited to be served, longingly staring at the fruit drinks being made by the vendors. Fruit drinks vendor Siti Hajar said that she only sold the beverage seasonally. 'ÄúI only do this during Ramadhan for additional income,'Äù said the 47-year-old as she poured servings of the beverage into transparent plastic bags. A similar scene could seen at Pondok Indah Mall in South Jakarta, where hundreds of visitors scrambled to find tables in the mall'Äôs restaurants. Although the call to maghrib prayers was still an hour away, visitors had already started ordering food to keep tables. One visitor, Ratih, said that she was keeping a table to break the fast with her friends. 'ÄúToday is the first day of fasting. I am so excited to break fast in the mall with my friends,'Äù she said. At Istiqlal Mosque located in Central Jakarta, which is the city'Äôs biggest mosque, 45 cooks prepared 3,000 boxes of food to distribute to the needy. According to kompas.com, the mosque spends roughly Rp 30 million (US$2,502) a day during Ramadhan. The mosque'Äôs food procurement unit head, Hassanuddin, said that thousands of people gathered to break fast and pray at the city'Äôs largest mosque each day. The crowded streets that were seen nearing sunset, however, were a stark contrast to the strangely deserted city streets in the early hours of the day. Many Jakartans had slept in after sahur (pre-dawn meals), only getting out of their homes close to sunset to scour the city with friends and family in search of the perfect place to break the fast. The usually crowded Car Free Day along Jl. Sudirman in South Jakarta and Jl. MH Thamrin in Central Jakarta on Sunday was exceptionally quiet. Very few runners were seen enjoying the empty streets, Antara reported. Despite the fasting month, some Jakartans still insist on watching World Cup matches in bars late at night. Even threats by the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) to raid such bars did not stop soccer fans from heading to nightspots to watch soccer matches. The FPI has pledged to raid bars that continue to sell alcohol, which Muslims are banned from drinking under Islamic law, or stay open too late. It vowed to 'Äúmonitor any sinful activities in entertainment places, cafes and bars during Ramadhan'Äù, said FPI Jakarta head Salim Alatas, as quoted by AFP news agency. However, the AFP reported that bars that remained open in Jakarta were still packed with locals and expatriates late Saturday and early Sunday. One visitor, 27-year-old Endika Setiadi Putra, said that with the World Cup now in the knockout stages, the excitement would keep drawing people to watch the matches in bars even during Islam'Äôs holiest month. 'ÄúIf it'Äôs the weekend, most people will go out [to watch the matches],'Äù Putra said as quoted by AFP. Meanwhile, the Medan Police conducted a raid early on Sunday morning to catch violent motorcycle gangs and prevent street racing, which has caused safety concerns among residents. Medan Police chief Comr. Budi Hendrawan said that the police would conduct such raids throughout Ramadhan to maintain safety during the holy month. 'ÄúWe ticketed 455 motorists during the raid.

"Fri, June 20, 2014",Both tickets vague on tackling tolerance,"Make your choice: A motorcyclist passes a billboard featuring the presidential tickets of Prabowo Subianto-Hatta Rajasa and Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo-Jusuf Kalla, which has been placed by the Independent Election Monitoring Committee (KIPP) in Lhokseumawe, Aceh, on Thursday. (Antara/Rahmad) While the Prabowo Subianto-Hatta Rajasa ticket is embracing firebrand groups in its coalition, the Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo-Jusuf Kalla ticket says it will enforce the law and stamp out religious intolerance. A member of the Prabowo-Hatta campaign team, Kastorius Sinaga, said the ticket would not tolerate the presence of conservative groups that rejected pluralism and religious freedom, including the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). 'ÄúWe embrace all the support we receive, as long as they agree with our stance. Otherwise, they'Äôre out,'Äù Kastorius said in a recent discussion. He added that for the time being, the Gerindra Party coalition could accept the presence of the FPI as proof of its inclusive approach. 'ÄúWe'Äôll accept them for now, but later, we'Äôll guide them according to our principles,'Äù he added. Kastorius, who is also a Democratic Party politician, said such an inclusive approach would also be adopted in regard to various political parties that made up the Gerindra coalition. Recently, Gerindra came under heavy criticism for using the phrase 'Äúreligious purification'Äù in its party manifesto. Many have accused Gerindra of instigating discrimination against minority sects within Islam, as it implied that Prabowo, if elected, would start a program to bring back members of the sects to the mainstream teachings of Islam. Kastorius said the phrase was down to an editorial error. Prabowo'Äôs brother, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, who is also the deputy chairman of Gerindra'Äôs patron board, said the party had dropped the 'Äúpurification of religious teachings'Äù program from the manifesto, following criticism from many quarters. Last year, Hashim said he gave the administration of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono an F-minus grade on ensuring religious tolerance. He said violence in recent years against Christian, Ahmadiyah 'Äî a minority Islamic sect 'Äî and other minorities showed a 'Äútotal failure'Äù by the Yudhoyono administration to ensure religious tolerance. Hashim also said Prabowo, if elected president, would enforce laws that protected religious freedom. Meanwhile, a member of the Jokowi-Kalla presidential campaign team, Siti Musdah Mulia, said if elected, the ticket would improve the legal system so that it could empower law enforcement agencies to take firm action against firebrand individuals and organizations that promoted intolerance. Musdah also said the ticket planned to drop all regulations that had the potential to infringe on civil and political rights. She said that one of the proposals included giving people the freedom to state whatever their religion was on their personal identification cards. A potential Jokowi-Kalla administration could even remove information regarding faith from the ID cards. 'ÄúConsistent with our vision and mission, then the information regarding faith on ID cards could be completed with any religious affiliation, or else we should just drop it altogether,'Äù said Musdah. However, on Thursday, Jokowi said he had no plan to drop the religion section from ID cards. 'ÄúWe have Pancasila as our country'Äôs foundation. Its first article clearly says 'ÄòKetuhanan Yang Maha Esa'Äô [The Belief in One God], so [having a religion] is part of our character and identity,'Äù Jokowi told reporters in Tegal, Central Java. He said there was no practical reason to drop the religion section from ID cards. 'ÄúWhy should we remove it [from IDs] if we know that this concerns our national identity?'Äù he said. 'ÄúThe Bhinneka Tunggal Ika [Unity in Diversity] principle must be upheld.'Äù Surveys, including those from the Wahid Institute and Setara Institute, showed an increase in religious violence every year during Yudhoyono'Äôs two five-year terms. The Yudhoyono administration is considered to have comprehensively failed to deal with cases of religious-based violence, including attacks against followers of the Ahmadiyah in Cikeusik, Banten, and Shiites in Sampang, East Java. The illegal closure of churches, such as the Indonesian Christian Church (GKI) Yasmin in Bogor and Batak Protestant Church (HKBP) Filadelfia in Bekasi, by local government administrations, has also shown government inaction in the face of pressure from intolerant groups.

(JP/Indra Harsaputra) Scenes of scantily clad women sitting on long sofas behind glass windows in the brothels of Dolly red-light district look set to be a thing of a past, as the Surabaya administration officially closed the area on Wednesday. Witnessed by Surabaya Mayor Tri Rismaharini, East Java Governor Soekarwo and Social Affairs Minister Salim Segaf Al Jufri, 100 residents of Dolly in the Putat Jaya area read the declaration of closure of an area once dubbed Southeast Asia'Äôs largest red-light district. The declaration stated the residents wanted Dolly to become clean, safe and free from prostitution. The residents also wanted to build their area into an economic center based on their religion and regulations. Several children living in the red-light district read from the Koran, before residents read the declaration in a ceremony held at the nearby Islamic center in Dukuh Kupang. According to the data from the city'Äôs social agency, 1,020 sex workers and 311 pimps depended on Dolly for their livelihoods. The area, which consisted of 52 brothels, was first established by a sex worker named Dolly Khavit in 1967. To overcome the impact of the closure, the Social Affairs Ministry has allocated Rp 8 billion (US$676,859) to be disbursed to sex workers and pimps, with each individual receiving Rp 5 million. After the announcement, brothel operators said they would resume activities on Thursday evening. 'ÄúDolly is closed today not because we'Äôre afraid of the mayor'Äôs decision, but residents are focused on securing the area and preventing security personnel, as well as members of the FPI [Islam Defenders Front] who threatened to conduct sweeps, from entering,'Äù Buchori, who also operates a brothel and food stall in Dolly, told The Jakarta Post on Wednesday. 'ÄúResidents are keeping guard in turns. In every corner of the area, an alarm will be triggered to assemble other residents armed with sharp weapons and clubs,'Äù he said. Buchori said residents were willing to die to prevent the closure of Dolly, as they were deeply dependent on it for their livelihoods. Thousands of residents, sex workers and pimps who rejected the closure blocked access to the red-light area. They almost clashed with hundreds of police officers who tried to open the blockades, but calmed down as the police backed off. In Jakarta, National Police chief Gen. Sutarman said on Wednesday that the force would fully back the Surabaya administration'Äôs endeavors to close Dolly amid resistance from the local residents, sex workers and pimps. 'ÄúWe must support whatever decision the regional administration has made,'Äù he said in Jakarta. 'ÄúIn facing protesters, we try not to use arms. We will try a persuasive approach. We have a lot of experience in closing such establishments. If we keep guard of the place, slowly the protesters will disperse,'Äù Sutarman continued. Separately, Surabaya municipal secretary Hendro Gunawan said despite the closure, the municipality would not come down hard on closing the red-light district. 'ÄúWe will not act harshly in closing Dolly. The closure of Dolly will not involve blocking access to Jl. Jarak and will not block smaller streets inside Dolly,'Äù said Hendro. He added that Surabaya municipality would persuade the occupants and sex workers to change their professions in the long run, until Dolly was completely closed. Closing Dolly Nov 2010 Surabaya administration installs CCTV cameras at Dolly to deter new sex workers. June 2011 Surabaya administration imposes restricted operational hours on the red-light complex, from 24 hours to 16 hours a day. Nov 2011 East Java Governor Soekarwo announces that his administration will close down all 47 red-light districts spread across the province's 33 regencies and municipalities by 2014. He also says an unlimited budget will be allocated to realize the plan. Nov 2013 Surabaya Mayor Tri Rismaharini declares her intention to permanently close down Dolly. June 2, 2014 Risma pledges to close down Dolly by June 18, saying that the closure will be in line with Bylaw No. 7/ 1999 banning the use of a building as a place of prostitution. June 5, 2014 Dolly sex workers stage a rally to protest the plan to shut down the complex. June 12, 2014 National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) urges the Surabaya administration not to forcibly close down Dolly. Komnas HAM commissioner Dianto Bachriadi says the local administration needs to protect its residents whatever their profession, adding that the closure had the potential to cause financial losses. June 18, 2014 Surabaya administration officially closes down Dolly. Facts about Dolly: - According to the Surabaya Social Agency, at least 1,020 sex workers and 311 pimps worked in the Dolly complex, most of them hailing from outside Surabaya. Dolly was known as the biggest red-light district in Southeast Asia. - To date, the Surabaya administration has closed down six red-light districts. Tambak Asri, Klakah Rejo and Dupak Bangunsari were followed in December 2013 by the Sememi red-light district and then Jarak and Dolly in 2014.

"Sun, June 15, 2014",Another hard-line group implicated in violence,"Fervor: Members of several hard-line groups including the Islamic Jihad Front (FJI) and the Council of Indonesian Jihad Fighters (MMI) protest at a rally against Ahmadiyah in Baciro, Yogyakarta, in 2012. (Tempo/Survo Wibowo) One hard-line group allegedly involved in violent acts in Yogyakarta is the Islamic Jihad Front (FJI). Among the more recent incidents was the attack on a sealed Pentecostal church in Pangukan, Sleman, by local residents after the church was reopened by members of the congregation for religious activities. A local community leader named Turmudzi alleged that he received help from several mass organizations, including the FJI, to stop the congregation. The FJI'Äôs leader, Abdurahman, was seen with Turmudzi on Wednesday at Sleman Police headquarters. The group was launched in November 2011 and, ironically, is headquartered near the Kasihan Police station in Bantul, Yogyakarta. 'ÄúWe have some 150 members in Yogyakarta and some 500 supporters,'Äù Abdurahman claimed. The group even apparently has an official website and Facebook page. The FJI'Äôs flag is black, showing a Koran framed between two swords. Its motto is 'Äúlive a noble life or die as a martyr'Äù. Among its objectives are improving the morality of members, upholding sharia law and improving people'Äôs understanding about Islam. The group has recently been in the media for protesting against the presence of minority Shia Muslims in Yogyakarta, against the Adiyuswo Easter celebration for the elderly in Gunungkidul and against Christians opening a house of worship in Baciro. Members of the group also allegedly assaulted Gunungkidul Interfaith Forum activist Aminuddin Azis. 'ÄúWe did it in Gunungkidul because there were efforts toward Christianization,'Äù Abdurahman was quoted as saying. The FJI, however, has less than cordial relations with the infamous Islam Defenders Front (FPI).

"Mon, June 9, 2014",Commentary: Prabowo: The (unwanted) hope for military power revival,"Presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto has clearly given the military strong hope that it might regain the political power it lost following the fall of his former father-in-law, Soeharto, in May 1998. There are strong public fears of efforts by the Army 'Äî or certain elements within the military 'Äî to coerce people to vote for the former general in the July 9 presidential election. The presidential bid of Prabowo, who was dismissed from the military for his alleged role in the kidnapping of anti-Soeharto activists, has revived the sweet memory of the New Order, when the military enjoyed lucrative privileges 'Äî as well as carte blanche to abuse human rights in the name of 'Äúprotecting'Äù the state from evil elements. Indonesian Military (TNI) chief Gen. Moeldoko and Army chief of staff Gen. Budiman have repeatedly assured the public that the military would be neutral in the election. But a recent incident in Central Jakarta of TNI personnel intimidating voters and similar media reports from other places are strong indications that the military'Äôs temptation to re-enter politics should be closely watched by civil society. Also alarming is Prabowo'Äôs move to bring problematic and questionable groups or persons into his camp. How can he fulfill all the promises he has made to his unruly farrago of supporters? Moeldoko was ridiculous when he denied an already incredulous statement from the Army that explained the intimidation incident as simply an Army captain and a non-commissioned officer 'Äútrying'Äù to identify voters'Äô preferences in a sub-district in Central Jakarta. As reported by several media outlets, Moeldoko insisted there was no evidence that the Gambir district military chief Capt. Saliman and Corp. Rusfandi were guilty of 'Äúguiding'Äù residents to cast their ballot for the pair of Prabowo and Hatta Rajasa in the July 9 presidential election. Moeldoko and Budiman have used the tactics of 'Äúdenial'Äù and 'Äúpointing the finger at much lower subordinates'Äù, practices rampantly employed by military generals when the public demanded accountability for gross human rights abuses amid the fall of Soeharto. Junior officers should take responsibility and bear the consequences for the mega-crimes because the generals easily argued that their 'Äúinstructions were misunderstood'Äù by their subordinates. Prabowo was discharged from the military, and he fled to Jordan, apparently to prevent 'Äúunnecessary implications'Äù arising from public suspicion and allegations. The question is not about Prabowo'Äôs alleged dual citizenship (Indonesian and Jordan) but about his fundamental military spirit of responsibility. Indonesians are likely to agree that we should have a strong and powerful military, but one that makes foreign enemies tremble, not the children of its own nation, as Soeharto'Äôs military did. Kidnap the foreign soldiers who try to invade Indonesia, not the young Indonesian activists fighting for a much better country. Also, it is very natural that Prabowo would try to gain as much support as possible from various groups in society in his presidential bid against rival Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo. However, that Prabowo has warmly welcomed the notorious Islam Defenders Front (FPI) into his camp has triggered fears. The former general should have thought twice before enlisting the FPI as an ally. As an ordinary citizen, I cannot understand his decision. To me, it looks like a desperate attempt to get as many votes as possible without considering the implications of where they come from. Today, Prabowo and Jokowi will square off in the first of five live debates broadcast by several TV networks. Indonesians will have the opportunity to get a closer look at their potential future leader. But we need to bear in mind that those impressive in public speaking are not necessarily equally impressive in delivering on what they promise. The General Elections Commission (KPU) and the Elections Monitoring Agency (Bawaslu) will continue to work hard (and hopefully also intelligently) to ensure that we will have a fair, just, direct and secret election in July 9. Many voters think that Prabowo would be a firm leader in defending the country'Äôs interests because he is a former general. But we should also remember that we have been led by a retired Army general 'Äî President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono 'Äî for the last 10 years, and we were often frustrated by his slow actions. He is often described as Mr. Doubtful. Do you want to know my choice in the presidential election? I will vote for a candidate who I can trust, although probably he is not as smart or as promising as many people expect. I will cast my vote for a candidate who, according to me, has done his best to serve the interests of ordinary people like me. I will a choose a leader who has a good track record on human rights, and who has a simple life like most of us 'Äî ordinary Indonesians. Let voters decide the future of the nation. They have the constitutional right to choose whether Prabowo or Jokowi will lead us for the next five years.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/06/09/commentary-prabowo-the-unwanted-hope-military-power-revival.html,,2014
"Fri, June 6, 2014",Campaign turns ugly with alleged TNI bias,"The second day of the General Elections Commission (KPU)-sanctioned campaign period saw on Thursday an alleged violation when the Indonesian Military'Äôs (TNI) village supervisory non-commissioned officers (Babinsa) reportedly intimidated a local in Central Jakarta. The officer allegedly forced a resident to pledge to vote for the Gerindra Party'Äôs presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto, a former commander of the Army'Äôs Special Forces (Kopassus). Media reports said that early on Tuesday a resident of a Chinese Christian neighborhood in Central Jakarta was visited by a man claiming to be a Babinsa officer who said he was assigned to verify data of eligible voters in the neighborhood, but later registered the intention of locals in the area to vote for Prabowo. The alleged incident happened only days after President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono publicly called on the Indonesian Military (TNI) as well as the National Police to remain neutral in the lead-up to the July 9 presidential election. Yudhoyono was visibly angry upon making a statement that several high-ranking officers had been approached by political parties to support particular presidential candidates contesting the July 9 poll. The TNI claimed to have no knowledge of the incident. However, TNI spokesman Maj. Gen. Fuad Basya said that the Army had ordered its unit commanders and Strategic Intelligence Agency (BAIS) to launch a probe into the allegation, as part of a move to ensure the TNI'Äôs neutrality ahead of the election. 'ÄúThe TNI commander [Gen. Moeldoko] has given an order to us to launch an investigation into this allegation,'Äù Fuad told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting at the House of Representatives on Thursday. Fuad also said that 'Äúofficers who support either one of the presidential candidates will be punished'Äù. Moeldoko, who was also seen at the scene, declined to comment. Prabowo'Äôs camp said that it was not responsible for the alleged violation. Prabowo'Äôs national campaign team spokesperson Tantowi Yahya, who is also a member of House Commission I overseeing foreign affairs and military, said that such a violation was not acceptable. 'ÄúWe have nothing to do with it. It'Äôs not part of our strategy,'Äù he said. Meanwhile, on the second day of the election campaign, the presidential candidates started reaching out to voters outside Java. On Thursday, Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo and his running mate Jusuf Kalla split their duties by traveling to the country'Äôs farthest provinces, Papua and Aceh. In Papua, Jokowi introduced his spouse Iriana, whose name was taken from the province'Äôs original name Irian Jaya, in a move seen as an attempt to win the hearts of locals. In Aceh, Kalla met with local Muslim leaders and presented a proposal to promote tolerance and peace among subscribers of different faiths in the country. While Kalla was meeting with religious leaders to promote pluralism, in Jakarta leaders of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) officially declared their support for Prabowo and his running mate Hatta Rajasa, on the condition that more sharia-inspired bylaws be passed in the future. FPI chairman Rizieq Shihab said that the group supported the Prabowo-Hatta ticket because the pair won support from Islamic-based parties like the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), the United Development Party (PPP) and the Crescent Star Party (PBB).

"Fri, June 6, 2014",Pluralism in peril as poll nears,"When in Rome: Presidential candidate Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo (left) wears traditional attire during his campaign rally in Jayapura, Papua province, on Thursday. The presidential election will take place on July 9. (AP/Djefri Pattirajawane) Pluralism in the country is in danger of being eroded as intolerant groups flex their political muscle ahead of the presidential election. In the wake of attacks on a church and Christian prayer group in Yogyakarta, an invitation to attend a public gathering initially entitled Umat Islam Bersatu Memerangi Pluralisme (The Muslim Community Unites to Fight Pluralism) at the province'Äôs iconic Masjid Gedhe Mosque in Kauman has begun circulating on social media. The main speaker of the gathering, which is scheduled for Sunday, June 8, is Jafar Umar Thalib, the former commander of the defunct Laskar Jihad paramilitary group. Laskar Jihad was a Yogyakarta-based radical Islamic group that supplied volunteers to fight alongside Muslims against Christians during sectarian conflict in Maluku in 1999-2000. After debate broke out on the Internet about the title of the event, the mosque'Äôs imam, Budi Setiawan, said the title of the gathering had been changed at the request of the mosque'Äôs management. The event, which is being organized by the Islamic People'Äôs Forum (FUI), has been renamed Umat Islam Bersatu untuk Indonesia Maju (The Muslim Community Unites for a Developed Indonesia). The public gathering will take place only a week after members of hard-line Islamic groups attacked a Pentecostal church in Sleman, Yogyakarta in front of police officers who failed to take any action. Three days earlier, a group of people wearing Arabic-style clothes attacked the house of Julius Felicianus in which a rosary prayer-recital was taking place. Julius, Kompas TV journalist Michael Aryawan and three other members of the group were injured in the attack. The incidents appear to indicate a resurgence of Islamic radicalism in Yogyakarta, which is the birthplace of the Muhammadiyah, the nation'Äôs second-largest Islamic organization and whose former chairman, Amien Rais, is a staunch supporter of presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto. It is unclear if the gathering on Sunday has anything to do with the election, though Budi said one of the political figures who would attend the gathering was M. Syukri Fadholi, the head of the local chapter of the United Development Party (PPP). Prabowo, whose candidacy has been endorsed by all Islamic-based parties including the PPP, has been rallying support from Muslim organizations, including the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI). On Wednesday, former Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) chairman Hidayat Nur Wahid visited the FPI headquarters in Jakarta where its members openly declared their support for Prabowo, who is running with National Mandate Party (PAN) chairman Hatta Rajasa. On the same day in Central Java and Yogyakarta, thousands of FPI members also voiced their support for Prabowo, who once said that all groups, including the FPI, should be involved in developing the nation. FPI chairman Habib Muchsin Alatas said, as quoted by kompas.com, that they were rooting for Prabowo through the Islamic parties that joined the Gerindra Party-led coalition. He said the Islamic parties had to ensure that Prabowo would free Indonesia from imperialism and liberalism. A Prabowo-Hatta administration, he said, must also not reject sharia-based bylaws. The declarations of support for Prabowo from the hard-line groups came as rival candidate Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo faced a slew of claims accusing him of being a Christian of Chinese descent and also a supporter of the Shia minority. Jokowi and his running mate, Jusuf Kalla, have repeatedly insisted that he has always been a Muslim. Subhi Azhari, advocacy coordinator for The Wahid Institute, said that the move by Prabowo'Äôs camp to court groups like the FPI could be seen as a tacit endorsement of intolerance. 'ÄúThis means they are sanctioning acts of intolerance and violence,'Äù he said, adding that the recent incidents of religious violence in Yogyakarta could be politically motivated. Gerindra denies it has courted intolerant groups and claims that it champions Pancasila. Hashim Djojohadikusumo, Prabowo'Äôs younger brother and a senior Gerindra member, has said he would quit Gerindra if it was ever backed by the FPI. Hashim also said his party had dropped a program of 'Äúpurification of religious teachings'Äù from its manifesto following criticism that the party took a fundamentalist stance toward religion and religious diversity. Fadli Zon, Gerindra'Äôs campaign team secretary, however, said that he welcomed support from all groups, including the FPI. When asked about the FPI'Äôs tendency to use force, he said that it did not matter as it was in the past. 'ÄúWe don'Äôt talk about past form, we talk about the presidential election,'Äù Fadli said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/06/06/pluralism-peril-poll-nears.html,,2014
"Fri, June 6, 2014",Sectarian violence business as usual in Central Java,"Religious intolerance is an ongoing problem in Central Java, as the province saw several cases of religious-based violence in the first six months of 2014, said the Social and Religious Studies Institute (ELSA) on Thursday in its mid-year bulletin in Semarang. ELSA research coordinator Tedi Kholiludin said the first case of 2014 involved vandalism of a Hindu temple in Dukuh Gitiloka hamlet, Miri district, Sragen regency. Though not reported until Jan. 19, it is believed on Jan. 16 several statues in the temple were destroyed. Police and village officials have yet to identify the perpetrators. 'ÄúThe second case was the clash between residents and members of the Islam Defenders Front [FPI] in Wonosobo,'Äù said Tedi. Tedi said that in the mid-January incident, Central Java FPI chapter head Shihabudin, who is also caretaker of the Al Hadits Islamic boarding school in Wonosobo, spoke at a religious event commemorating the Prophet Muhammad'Äôs birthday in Bowongso village, Kalikajar district. In his sermon, Shihabudin incensed some residents when he mentioned that residents should fight immorality by forming an FPI branch in Wonosobo, the only region in Central Java without an FPI chapter. After a verbal altercation, Shihabudin tried to leave but was accosted. 'ÄúThose who did not accept Shihabudin'Äôs sermon stopped his car [as he was leaving] and demanded he step out and apologize. However, he refused do so. A number of people broke the car windows and threatened to roll the car,'Äù said Tedi. The third case involved residents in Demak forcibly disbanding a routine Koran recital meeting by the Koran Interpretation Council (MTA). The MTA is deemed controversial by some Muslims who say it teaches principles that are not in line with Islam. The residents then vandalized the house where the activity was held, and several MTA members were injured in the incident. 'ÄúAnother case was perpetrated by village officials in Grobogan, Central Java, who [wrongly] accused the Jantiko Mantab religious group of causing public unrest,'Äù said Tedi. The officials ended up apologizing to the Jantiko Mantab members. According to Tedi, these instances of religious intolerance had become typical. 'ÄúActually, nothing is new in the cases. The FPI, for instance, causes trouble every year. While this year residents in Wonosobo were disturbed by FPI'Äôs religious aggression, last year residents in Kendal were disturbed by it,'Äù said Tedi. On a bright note, Tedi did note that the start of 2014 saw some progress in resolving sectarian flareups, such as in Grobogan, when the local officials apologized to the adherents to avoid escalation. In 2012 and 2013, there were six alleged violations of religious freedom and seven cases of religious intolerance committed in Central Java. Separately, a professor of cultural anthropology at Semarang'Äôs Diponegoro University, Mudjahirin Thohir, said religious followers who perpetrated violence in the name of religion misunderstood religion. He cited two typical triggers of religious violence in Indonesia 'Äî either theology or external factors. 'ÄúThey regard [these acts of intolerance] as jihad, but actually they are radical actions that could undermine the religion itself, because in essence, every faith in the world teaches love,'Äù he said. By external factors, Mudjahirin was referring to chaos in Indonesia'Äôs legal, political, economic, social and cultural systems. He said these were always blamed for religious violence in the country. 'ÄúIt'Äôs time for religious leaders to persuade worshippers to become more mature in understanding religion in the context of a pluralistic Indonesia. Besides that, the Indonesian government, through law enforcement, must take firm action against those who resort to violence in the name of religion,'Äù he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/06/06/sectarian-violence-business-usual-central-java.html,,2014

So far, Bawaslu has received six complaints about election law violations. (Antara/Yudhi Mahatma) Personal attacks and a growing division between moderate and hardline Muslims marred the first day of the presidential campaign on Wednesday. A group called Flambora reported former State Intelligence Agency (BIN) chief AM Hendropriyono to the National Police for describing Gerindra Party presidential hopeful Prabowo Subianto as 'Äúmentally disturbed'Äù. 'ÄúDescribing Prabowo as a psychopath or mentally disturbed is slander. We demand proof,'Äù said Flambora leader Alfons Loemau, whose group claimed to represent ethnic groups from Flores, Sumba, Timor and Alor in East Nusa Tenggara. In a discussion on Tuesday, Hendropriyono claimed that, as Prabowo'Äôs former commanding officer in the Army, he had seen sufficient evidence suggesting Prabowo had a mental illness. According to Hendropriyono, who is on Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) presidential contender Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo'Äôs campaign team, Prabowo scored the lowest on a psychological test when applying for a promotion in the Army. 'ÄúAs his commander, I had access to his test results, which technically put him in the G4 level, meaning that he was insane and on the verge of schizophrenia,'Äù he claimed. Hendropriyono alleged that an Army officer described in such a way was obviously temperamental and had a short fuse. 'ÄúHe is no longer an emotional person but a psychopath.'Äù Prabowo'Äôs temperament recently made headlines following footage on YouTube recorded when he registered his candidacy at the General Elections Commission (KPU) in Jakarta last month. The footage shows Prabowo allegedly punching a man. Prabowo, who will focus his campaign in Java this week, embarked on his first tour in West Java'Äôs capital Bandung, meeting supporters of his coalition. He was accompanied by Golkar Party chairman Aburizal Bakrie. West Java is the most populous province and home to around 18 percent of eligible voters. Prabowo'Äôs running mate Hatta Rajasa, who is also chairman of the National Mandate Party (PAN) was in Jakarta meeting supporters before heading for Banten on Thursday. While Hatta made no statement on Wednesday, PAN deputy chairman Dradjad Wibowo mocked Jokowi for being a poor orator, as evidenced on Tuesday when he failed to impress the audience during his joint declaration for a peaceful campaign remarks. 'ÄúNo great leader in this world has had poor public speaking skills.'Äù Meanwhile, Jokowi joined PDI-P elites and officials from the coalition in a low-key celebration and prayer at PDI-P headquarters in South Jakarta. After the celebration, Jokowi made all PDI-P regional leaders agree to a written rule, which demanded that they avoid smear campaigns. 'ÄúPak Jokowi has instructed party members, as well as supporters to uphold peace without black campaigning,'Äù said PDI-P deputy secretary-general Hasto Kristiyanto. Jokowi'Äôs running mate Jusuf Kalla met leaders and members of the country'Äôs largest Islamic organization the Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) in Jakarta. During the discussion, Kalla requested the audience help address the slur campaigns against Jokowi, particularly over his religion and racial identity. 'ÄúHe [Jokowi] is a devout Javanese Muslim,'Äù said Kalla NU senior figure Alwi Shihab told the audience that it would be dangerous for Muslims if Jokowi failed to clinch the presidency.

"Thu, February 20, 2014",Tan Malaka deserves credit,"While we are happy knowing that remains of controversial leftist figure Tan Malaka were eventually found, bad news was not far behind. A book discussion on Tan, the philosopher and former exile, by renowned Dutch historian Harry A. Poeze was banned by Surabaya Police and the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). With the branding of Tan as a member of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), the discussion group was accused of being members of the now-defunct party in the East Java capital. It is no exaggeration to say that the ban clearly shows the decline of dialogue when it comes to handling dissenting opinions. As soon as dialogue stalls, the truth seeking process also comes to an end. Tan remains misunderstood due to his communist association. His speech at the Fourth Congress of the Communist International on Nov. 12, 1922 'Äî 'ÄúCommunism and Pan-Islamism'Äù 'Äî on the one hand displayed no rejection to Islam and explained his understanding of Pan-Islamism and its shifting role historically on the other. He wrote the piece before there was CIA with its Congress for Cultural Freedom tactic. The dialogical approach is instrumental in prompting both the FPI and organizing committee of the book discussion to show respect for Tan'Äôs persona, which is now gaining momentum following the excavation of remains believed to be those of the controversial figure. The absence of dialogue would only perpetuate Tan'Äôs image of being an insurrectionist, whereas in fact he was also the country'Äôs founding and revolutionary father along with Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta and Sutan Sjahrir. Many misunderstood the tension between Tan and Sukarno-Hatta to be bound to the idea of communism. Whereas the friction was linked to Tan'Äôs opposition to Sukarno'Äôs negotiations with the colonizer regarding independence. Thus, it is deceptive to claim that their discord was ideological by nature since distinct fighting strategies lent more color to their disagreement. The FPI would be better off rethinking its opinion of Tan'Äôs contribution to this country. It can be done through adopting Buya Hamka'Äôs notion of Tan, putting him alongside Muslim leaders 'Äî together with Sukarno, Hatta and HOS Tjokroaminoto. Despite Tan'Äôs involvement in the international communist movement, Hamka argued that he would not be easily be split from his Minang background as he grasped Islam, the Koran and surau (mosque) simultaneously. In addition, Tan is a victim of uncritical historical interpretation. Soeharto'Äôs New Order regime has persistently demonized Tan for his leftist and radical thoughts; striking his name from the pages of history while he was in power. Sukarno, while president, named Tan a national hero in 1963. The government preferred to name streets after Tan rather than activating biographical studies involving historians. In a nutshell, the New Order propaganda categorized Tan as a 'Äúmonolithic person'Äù rather than a complex national character. It is very likely that the FPI'Äôs debacle of fathoming Tan in a proportional manner cannot be separated from the Wahhabism school of thought which has tended to ignore the importance of looking up to historical heroes and sites. The decision by Saudi Arabia to demolish key Islamic heritage sites, including Prophet Mohammed'Äôs shrine, indicates that Wahhabism really pays much less attention to the history. It is probable that some universities in Saudi Arabia do not have history departments with the main purpose of securing and preserving countless Islamic rites in Mecca and Medina. If any, where are Saudi Arabian historians'Äô voices against the kingdom'Äôs decision to bulldoze the Prophet'Äôs tomb? Despite the hullabaloo, the FPI should have high regard for Tan as a national hero by reading, criticizing and appreciating his thoughts and works. Letting any group of people discuss Tan'Äôs books and ideas is intended to explore the controversial figure as he was. His admirable personality would be an endless source of inspiration that class struggle, which is the very seed of communism, would end in an ironic manner. Above all, banning of the book discussion will further put the idea of progress and democratic freedom on a corner because it blocks any research into Indonesia'Äôs past that may correct the Soeharto-style brainwashing of the last decades.

The discussion was moved from the Stonen area to the campus due to threats from groups, including the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). (JP/Suherdjoko) Radicalism among senior high school students is on the rise, teachers of Islamic education in Semarang, Central Java, have warned. The topic emerged during a focus group discussion organized by the Religious and Social Study Institution (eLSA) in Semarang, Monday. Supervisor of Islamic education teachers Semarang M. Fauzin said that a student of a school that he supervised refused to salute the flag because the student was afraid of being polytheistic. 'ÄúWe are concerned about students of their age believing in counter-Constitutional and anti-Pancasila ideologies,'Äù Fauzin said. eLSA director Tedi Kholiludin said Islamic teachers were integral to the prevention of radicalism, as their role was to teach tolerance and interfaith respect. 'ÄúWe are worried that students are becoming narrow-minded,'Äù Tedi said. Quoting a survey that eLSA conducted on 112 students of 20 senior and senior vocational high schools in Semarang region, Tedi said that 60 percent of respondents said saying 'ÄúMerry Christmas'Äù was haram 'Äî forbidden by Islamic teaching. The survey, according to Tedi, also revealed that 98 percent of respondents considered Islam to not be against Pancasila, while 28 percent of respondents, who accepted Pancasila, supported the implementation of Islamic Sharia. Separately, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) Central Java branch on Monday evening decided against the forceful dispersal of a book discussion on Dutch researcher and author Harry Poeze'Äôs Tan Malaka, Gerakan Kiri dan Revolusi Indonesia (Tan Malaka, Leftist Movement and Indonesian Revolution) volume 4. Thanks to talks between Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo, Diponegoro University (Undip) rector Sudharto, dean of Undip'Äôs School of Cultural Sciences Agus Maladi 'Äî who all attended the discussion 'Äî and former FPI advocacy team chair Zaenal Abidin Petir regarding the event, the FPI canceled their plan. Yunantyo Adi of the Semarang History Activist Community, which along with the Hysteria Community organized the event, said that Zainal mediated between local FPI chairman Syihabudin and the organizing committee. 'ÄúWe met. I explained about Tan Malaka and gave him the book [...] He finally expressed no objection to the discussion,'Äù Yunantyo said. The author, Harry Poeze spent 41 years studying Tan. Volume 4 of the book focused on Tan establishing the Murba Party up until his murder in 1949 by First Lt. Sukotjo (who was later East Java governor) in Selopanggung subdistrict, Kediri, East Java.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/02/19/students-more-intolerant-fpi-cancels-talk-dispersal.html,,2014

"Wed, January 22, 2014","Rights rollback for religious minorities, women, HRW says","Indonesian women and religious minorities have faced heightened discrimination as a result of the government'Äôs failure to enforce human rights protections in 2013, Human Rights Watch (HRW) says in its World Report 2014. The Indonesian government under President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono should reverse course and enforce laws protecting religious freedom, the New York-based non-governmental advocacy organization further said. 'ÄúPresident Yudhoyono is all talk and no action when he faces government officials and militant groups who are intent on curbing the rights of women and religious minorities,'Äù HRW deputy Asia director Phelim Kine in a statement made available to The Jakarta Post on Wednesday. 'ÄúUnless Yudhoyono takes decisive action in the final months of his presidency in 2014, his legacy will be marred by his failure to defend the rights of all Indonesians,'Äù Kine added. The HRW said Indonesia should amend or abolish hundreds of local bylaws that discriminate against women and religious minorities. 'ÄúThe government should also release dozens of political prisoners, mostly Papuan and Moluccan activists, who were imprisoned for peaceful dissent,'Äù it said. In the 667-page world report, which is its 24th edition, HRW reviews human rights practices in more than 90 countries. It is said militant Sunni Islamist groups, such as the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), have frequently threatened or attacked religious minority communities with impunity. 'ÄúYet, Home Affairs Minister Gamawan Fauzi praised the FPI as a potential 'Äònational asset'Äô, on Oct.25, 2013,'Äù HRW said in the statement. The National Commission on Violence against Women reported in August that both central and local governments in Indonesia had passed 60 new discriminatory regulations in 2013, in addition to 282 similar rules already on the books. These include 79 local bylaws requiring women to wear the hijab, or head scarf. (ebf)",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/01/22/rights-rollback-religious-minorities-women-hrw-says.html,,2014
"Sat, December 21, 2013",Cases of hate against religious minorities rampant in 2013,"There were at least six alleged violations of religious freedom and seven cases of religious intolerance committed across Central Java in the period of 2012 to 2013, researchers say. Teddy Kholiluddin, a researcher at the Religious and Social Study Institute (eLSA) in Semarang, Central Java, said that the six violation cases included the ban on the establishment of a Ahmadiyah house of worship in Boyolali; a ban on the development of a rectory in Klaten; the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) conflict in Kendal; and the demolition of an Islamic boarding school in Sragen. 'ÄúA man called Suparno was murdered in December last year for converting to another religion,'Äù Teddy said. Religious intolerance cases included efforts to disrupt Christmas celebrations; accusations that the teachings of Jamaatul Islamiyah in Karanganyar and the teachings of Mbah Surodari in Brebes were deviant; and the ban on Majelis Tafsir Al-Qur'Äôan (MTA) in Grobogan. He also noticed although there was a new model of conflict such as hate crime, 90 percent of the cases occurred in Central Java were repetitions of old conflict patterns. 'ÄúSuparno'Äôs murder so far was a shocking case of a new pattern of conflict in the province,'Äù Teddy said. Teddy said that there had been a decrease in instances of religious intolerance and violations against religious freedom. 'ÄúRepeat incidents continue to occur. We should detect them as early as possible,'Äù he said. Separately, Semarang Legal Aid Institute (LBH) said 10 religious-related incidents occurred across the province in 2012. Among those in conflict were the Tauhid Indonesia Foundation (Yatain) in Surakarta and Karanganyar with Laskar Umat Islam Surakarta (LUIS). Conflicts, Andiyono of Semarang LBH, went on, had occurred between local administrations and minorities, for example, the children of Saminists, also known as Sedulur Sikep, in Kudus, were told Islamic studies at school was compulsory. Saminists do not believe in the existence of Allah, heaven or hell. Other conflicts include the ongoing refusal by locals for the establishment of a workshop by the followers of Sapta Darma in Rembang. Sapta Darma is a school of mysticism, which literally means seven (sapta) sacred obligations (dharma); the burning of an Islamic boarding school in Sragen; and a brawl between locals and the FPI in Kendal. According to Semarang LBH, three potentials for conflict had been identified: The judgement that particular sects were deviant; the establishment of houses of worship; and social conflict. Indonesian laws and the Constitution guarantee freedom of religion and faith as well as human rights. 'ÄúThe legal umbrella is there. It'Äôs now a matter of how the government upholds and functions the umbrella,'Äù Andiyono said. Despite the rampant cases of religious intolerance, Teddy said that there were also aspects that should be lauded, including the reopening of the Gereja Injili di Tanah Jawa (GITJ) church in Jepara after 12 years. Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo is committed to not issuing regulation on the banning of Ahmadiyah, while Wonosobo Regent Kholiq Arief has also made a commitment to ensure pluralism in his region. Teddy also noted that Shia communities were able to celebrate Ashura Day solemnly.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/12/21/cases-hate-against-religious-minorities-rampant-2013.html,,2013

"Sat, November 23, 2013",Different groups see Oz as common enemy,"The ongoing friction between Indonesia and Australia over wiretapping allegations can be seen as a blessing in disguise as it is uniting groups with different ideologies to voice their concerns over what they deem is tantamount to a violation of Indonesia'Äôs sovereignty. Paramilitary groups like Laskar Merah Putih, the Forum of Indonesian Veterans and Police and Military Retirees (FKPPI) and the Merah Putih Fighters Command shared the same ground outside the Australian Embassy with religious-based organizations like the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and the Indonesian Hizbut Tahrir (HTI) to demand Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott apologize for the wiretapping incident. Under tight police guard, the organizations deployed thousands of members as a sign that they meant business. Many FPI members threw rotten tomatoes and eggs at the embassy'Äôs fence during Friday'Äôs rally. Earlier, protesters burned Australian flags and a picture of Abbott to express their displeasure. They threatened that things would get ugly if the Australian government was not forthcoming with an apology. The organizations demanded that diplomatic ties be severed between the two countries and that the Australian ambassador be expelled. Public outrage has been widespread, with similar demands being made in other regions, such as Palembang, Yogyakarta and Surakarta. Others have expressed concern that the issue would eventually affect tourism as Australian tourists top the list of foreigners visiting Indonesian shores. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono previously stated that he would wait for the Australian government'Äôs official response. In the meantime, the President has halted information and intelligence exchange activities. Military cooperation has also been put on hold, as has intercepting boat people headed for Australia. 'ÄúThe damage is done and things will never be the same again,'Äù said Syarif Hidayatullah Islamic State University political scientist Burhanuddin Muhtadi. He said the wiretapping incident was a prime example of issues that frequently upset diplomatic relations between the neighboring countries. 'ÄúThis would definitely turn diplomatic relations sour, at least until the President'Äôs term ends in October next year.'Äù Regarding the fact that the incident has united mass organizations with different ideologies to express the same concerns, Burhanuddin said it happened every time a perceived enemy seemingly attempted to breach Indonesia'Äôs sovereignty. However, he noticed that the organizations would maintain their own perspectives when dealing with the issue. He added that unlike their paramilitary counterparts that viewed this from a national security perspective, the HTI would view Australia as part of the West infidel that was trying to mess with Indonesia, a predominantly Muslim country. He, however, said that once the two governments had settled the problem, the unity between the organizations would dissolve.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/11/23/different-groups-see-oz-common-enemy.html,,2013

"Sat, October 26, 2013",New police chief vows to get tough on firebrand groups,"Changing of the guard: The new National Police chief, Comr. Gen. Sutarman (left) poses with his predecessor Gen. Timur Pradopo after his inauguration at the State Palace in Jakarta on Friday. (JP/Jerry Adiguna) Newly installed National Police Chief Gen. Sutarman made a pledge on Friday that he would crack down on violent mass organizations that caused public disorder. Sutarman said after his inauguration ceremony at the State Palace that under his leadership the police would take action against such organizations and would not allow 'Äúthe law of the jungle'Äù to take the reins in the country. 'ÄúAny citizen has the right to conduct activities as long as they are consistent with the law. If no law is broken, there will be no problem,'Äù he said. 'ÄúBut, if someone does violate the law, we must take stern action in order to make sure no groups make their own rules to handle their problems,'Äù he said. Sutarman'Äôs statement came only one day after Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi hailed the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) as an asset to the nation. Gamawan urged local administrations to work with the FPI in solving urban problems. Gamawan made the statement as prosecutors sought seven-month prison sentences for two FPI members charged with involvement in a deadly clash with villagers in Sukorejo, Kendal regency, Central Java, in July. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono swore in Sutarman to replace Gen. Timur Pradopo as the National Police chief. Yudhoyono proposed Sutarman as the sole candidate for the top post at the National Police in what many described as one of the most crucial decisions made by the President ahead of the 2014 elections. On Friday, Sutarman, a former adjutant to former president Abdurrahman Wahid also vowed to eradicate thuggery, gambling and drugs. Responding to the recent rape case of a 16-year-old girl that implicated a number of police in Gorontalo, Sutarman said that he would improve oversight within the force. 'ÄúPublic trust contributes to our performance. The police are here to ensure the safety of the people,'Äù he said. Sutarman secured the House of Representatives'Äô approval during a 'Äúfit-and-proper'Äù test last week. During the test, Sutarman told lawmakers that he would step up efforts to curb endemic corruption within the force and other government institutions in the country. 'ÄúWe must handle corruption together, whether in enforcing the law or in preventing violations,'Äù he said. Antigraft watchdogs, however, have expressed their skepticism that Sutarman can take a bold stance against corruption, given his stance in openly opposing the Corruption Eradication Commission'Äôs (KPK) investigation into Insp. Gen. Djoko Susilo, a defendant in a graft case surrounding a Rp 144 billion (US$13.1 million) vehicle simulator procurement project. His 2012 wealth report shows that Sutarman had Rp 5.34 billion worth of assets and savings totaling $24,194, a slight increase from Rp 5.31 billion in 2011. He also had savings of $24,175 in 2011. KPK Chairman Abraham Samad said that he was optimistic that Sutarman could work better in building cooperation with the antigraft body. 'ÄúDon'Äôt look back. It is important to maintain cooperation with the KPK in the future. Without such synergy, it will be hard to eradicate corruption,'Äù Abraham told reporters after the inauguration ceremony. 'ÄúI hope [both institutions] will not repeat what happened in the past,'Äù Abraham said, alluding to a rocky relationship between the two institutions which involved the police arresting KPK commissioners and police detectives storming the KPK headquarters following the arrest of Djoko Susilo.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/10/26/new-police-chief-vows-get-tough-firebrand-groups.html,,2013

"Fri, September 20, 2013","UK opens new bigger, better embassy in Jakarta","Man on a mission: UK Prince Andrew poses with students before he opens the new British Embassy in Kuningan, South Jakarta, on Thursday. (JP/Nurhayati) The United Kingdom on Thursday officially opened its new embassy building in Jakarta, an occasion marked by the attendance of UK Prince Andrew. The new embassy, which is located on Jl. Patra Kuningan Raya, South Jakarta, replaces the former embassy on Jl. MH Thamrin in Central Jakarta. The new embassy has been in operation since the end of July and the old building is currently vacant but still owned by the UK government. The old embassy, which was located near the golden triangle and the main road connecting Jl. Sudirman and Jl. MH Thamrin, had increasingly become the target of protesters, often from hard-line groups. In 2004, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) knocked down the building'Äôs gate and pelted it with rotten eggs. The FPI had been protesting the UK'Äôs backing of Israel in the conflict between Israel and the Islamic-state of Palestine. To avoid any further damage and to ensure its staff were safe from attacks from protesters or extremist groups, the British government installed roadblocks at its two main access points, a move that was met with contempt from local residents. As a result of security issues the UK decided to seek a more suitable building in Kuningan. 'Äú[The old embassy] served us well. It held many memories, but it'Äôs time to move on. And so now, after many years in the making, we have a magnificent new building,'Äù said UK Ambassador to Indonesia, ASEAN and Timor Leste Mark Canning during the opening ceremony. Unlike the old embassy, the new building has a spacious multifunction grass field close to its main gate. It is double the size of the old embassy and is located close to local housing. Prince Andrew said in his opening remarks that the larger embassy reflected the developed interests of both the UK and Indonesia with the latter advancing its role globally. He also hinted that the new embassy would likely be expanded. 'ÄúI am slightly concerned that this embassy is too small, but just because you built it, does not mean that you do not need to expand it very soon. Because this country is going be one of the most important countries in Asia, in the future, it is coming soon ['Ä_] ,'Äù he said. On Wednesday, Prince Andrew met with Coordinating Minister for the Economy Hatta Rajasa to discuss trade and investment between the two countries. As a result, the two countries committed to boosting cooperation in the areas of trade, with a target of Â£4.4 billion (US$7 billion) trade value in the next two years, a big jump from the total trade value last year of Â£2.2 billion. Hatta said Prince Andrew'Äôs visit had injected momentum in to the process of improved cooperation between Indonesia and the UK, in addition to strengthening the two countries'Äô relations.

"Sat, September 14, 2013",FPI seek to cross to Bali to disperse Miss World,"Around 100 members of the hard-line group Islam Defenders Front (FPI) massed in Ketapang Port in Banyuwangi, East Java, on Saturday, seeking to cross to the island of Bali to disperse the 2013 Miss World pageant. The group walked to Katapang from Banyuwangi Baru station, which is located 100 meters from the port. However, they were blocked by hundreds of Mobile Brigade (Brimob) officers who were on standby at the main gate of the port. Currently, the FPI members are negotiating with the Brimob officers to try to make their way into the port, tempo.co reported on Saturday. In the previous protest by the FPI in East Java, the Coordinator of the event, Sasmito, said that they were ready to wage jihad in Bali to disperse the beauty pageant. 'ÄúAre you ready for jihad? Are you ready to clean Bali of sin?'Äù Sasmito asked the crowd during the previous protest. The 63rd staging of the Miss World pageant opened last Sunday after protests by Muslim hard-liners confined the event to Indonesia's predominantly Hindu resort island of Bali.

"Mon, August 26, 2013",Despised hardline FPI turns 15,"Despite repeated calls for its disbandment, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) celebrated its 15th anniversary on Sunday with a street rally on the capital'Äôs streets, while mulling over the presidential candidacy of its leader, Rizieq Shihab. Sunday'Äôs rally wrapped up a three-day national meeting by the firebrand organization, during which the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) and key members floated the idea of Rizieq'Äôs presidential bid. 'ÄúGod willing, if Habib Rizieq declares his intention, Muslims around the country will support him,'Äù MUI chairman Cholil Ridwan said. Rizieq shrugged off the proposal, saying it was merely media spin. On Sunday, Rizieq spoke to members of the FPI at the group'Äôs headquarters in Petamburan, Central Jakarta, where he made a fresh call for the dissolution of the National Police'Äôs Densus 88 counterterrorism squad and expressed the group'Äôs opposition to the Miss World beauty pageant, which is expected to take place in Bali next month. Rizieq warned that the FPI would take all necessary measures to prevent the Miss World beauty pageant from taking place, calling the pageant an insult to the country'Äôs indigenous culture, local wisdom and sharia (Islamic law). Rizieq said that Densus 88 and other counterterrorism agencies in the country, including the National Counterterrorism Agency (BNPT), were prone to human rights abuses. 'ÄúThey have on several occasions arrested, shot or killed the wrong people. Therefore, we will continue to call for the squad'Äôs disbandment. We will declare Densus 88 the common enemy to all Muslims if the government continues to ignore us,'Äù he added. Officially established by a number of local religious figures and Muslim activists in Jakarta in August 1998, the FPI has regularly been associated with violence as its members have frequently conducted regular raids in places deemed to be promoting blasphemy or immorality, while the country'Äôs authorities have rarely taken action against the group. The organization currently has more than 50,000 members. Members of the group'Äôs branch in Temanggung, Central Java, for example, clashed with residents in Sukorejo, Kendal, when conducting a sweep in the village'Äôs red-light area last July, killing one pregnant woman and injuring three other locals. On Saturday, the National Police and the National Intelligence Agency (BIN) called for the FPI to conduct a peaceful march to celebrate its anniversary. Members of the organization appeared to have followed the order. Dressed in white Muslim attire, the FPI members only carried white flags and giant Betawi effigies on motorbikes, trucks and buses as they left the organization'Äôs headquarters on Jl. Petamburan III. 'ÄúThank God we are not taking the same route as the convoy,'Äù said a Transjakarta bus attendant, who encountered the FPI rally on Saturday.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/08/26/despised-hardline-fpi-turns-15.html,,2013

"Tue, July 30, 2013",Mass Organization Law and the FPI conundrum,"The most recent atrocities committed by members of the firebrand Islam Defenders Front (FPI) brought to the surface the complex and thorny issue in fine tuning dynamics between religion and state in Indonesia. It also brought up anew the debate about the controversial Mass Organization (Ormas) Law within civil society. In regard to the Ormas law, civil society organizations and radical Islamist groups became unusual bedfellows in their opposition to the passing of the law by the House of Representatives, albeit for different reasons. Civil society groups feared a return to an authoritarian rule akin to the New Order'Äôs tight control over mass organizations. Radical Islamist groups, on the other hand, would love to have absolute control over society, as long as they are the ones controlling it. Their opposition to the law in this case is merely due to the fear that it may impact them directly, potentially getting them into trouble. That debate almost immediately got a case study, debating FPI'Äôs existence after its umpteenth violent act, in which its members were involved in running over and killing a pregnant woman with their car in a conflict with residents in Kendal, Central Java. Civil society is split in their views on how to deal with the FPI. Intellectuals, moderating the outrage against the FPI, have been countering public cries to disband it. Civil society groups'Äô main argument against calls to disband the FPI is their attempt to remain consistent in upholding the right to freedom of association and expression, even if it means defending the rights of radical groups. This tenuous balance between upholding rights to association and expression versus dealing with perpetual violent acts by radical groups such as the FPI is dilemmatic. It is a conundrum democratic proponents must face. Although the Mass Organization Law is problematic in many ways (for example, its definition of mass organization and other technical details), allowing the government to disband organizations through the court may not necessarily violate democratic principles as feared by civil society groups. Larry Diamond, in his seminal work Developing Democracy: Toward Consolidation made a very clear distinction in defining civil society, a definition that would be very useful in giving a clear definition of mass organizations, which our law fails to address. Diamond defines civil society as 'Äúan intermediary phenomenon standing between the private sphere and the state. Thus it excludes parochial society: inward looking groups ...,'Äù and it is 'Äúdistinct from political society ... whose primary goal is to win control of the state or at least some position in it'Äù. Thus, religious groups and organizations essentially are not necessarily part of civil society and therefore not categorized as mass organizations. Religious organizations and institutions (mosques, churches) primarily looking inwardly in managing affairs of the organization and members should have free reign within their organizations without interference from the state. However, the catch will be when a religious groups'Äô activity moves beyond its 'Äúprivate'Äù function and enters the public sphere. In what Diamond called 'Äúperforming mediating functions'Äù acting as a 'Äúbridge'Äù between the private interests of its group to the public sphere, they have become part of civil society and thus subject to laws concerning their activity. A key principle Diamond underlined is the principle of pluralism and diversity to which mass organizations within civil society must adhere. Thus, any extremist group such as the FPI that 'Äúseeks to monopolize a function or political space in society, crowding out all competitors while claiming that it represents the only legitimate path'Äù, has violated important democratic principles. Thus banning them with due process of the law would not be a violation of democracy. One may ask how it is different from the Ku Klux Klan, or the Westborough Baptist church in the United States. Both are extremely repulsive, bigoted groups allowed to exist in the US on the premise of freedom of speech. One crucial difference is that groups do not, and cannot dominate the public sphere and crowd out competing voices in US civil society. They are fringe groups not attached to any wider movements that threaten democracy in the US. The Westborough group is the most hated group in the US, a laughing stock to any US citizen outside of its own members. The FPI is different. Although its members are often dismissed as mere thugs, they represent a wider network of narrow-minded ideas that threaten Indonesia'Äôs budding democracy. They have become effective extensions and 'Äúsmashing tools'Äù of proponents of these ideologies to root out conflicting ideas. There are numerous poignant examples. The group we often dismiss as 'Äúsimple thugs'Äù recently won a judicial review at the Supreme Court to abolish a national regulation on alcohol control, to basically allow regional administrations with 'Äúfundamentalist'Äù tendencies to make their entire district or province 'Äúdry'Äù. Have we not learned from the US prohibition era, and its epic failure? The FPI has perpetrated countless acts of violence with near impunity. It attacked the police headquarters a few weeks ago. It even had the audacity to violently confront a peaceful movement of the Alliance for Religious Freedom at the National Monument in 2008. The FPI with other groups managed to outshout attempts to abolish the highly problematic Blasphemy Law, which is valid today. The FPI has not only attacked revered figures such as Abdurrahman 'ÄúGus Dur'Äù Wahid, but verbally threatened to overthrow the government in 2011. This alone should be enough cause to see the organization as fundamentally rotten in structure as it is not isolated actions of individual members. Disbanding such a problematic organization does not contradict democracy. On the other hand, it would send a clear message that no group, for whatever 'Äúdivine'Äù reason, can repeat acts that threaten and bleed our democracy without repercussions. ________________ Allowing the government to disband organizations through the court may not necessarily violate democratic principles. ___________________ The writer is a researcher at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Jakarta and political science lecturer at Pelita Harapan University, Tangerang.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/07/30/mass-organization-law-and-fpi-conundrum.html,,2013
"Mon, July 29, 2013",Political parties pass the buck on FPI,"In spite of the recent public condemnation of violent raids in Makassar, South Sulawesi, and Kendal, Central Java, the firebrand group Islam Defenders Front (FPI) will remain a feature of the country'Äôs political life, with no major political parties prepared to curb the hard-line organization. Almost all political parties, except for the United Development Party (PPP), which is chaired by Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali, have issued condemnations of the role of the FPI in the fatal clash in Kendal, which left a pregnant resident, Tri Muniarti, dead. But when pressed about what to do next with the organization, three major political parties, the ruling Democratic Party, the Golkar Party and the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) maintained that it was up to the National Police and the Home Ministry to deal with it. After calling for the disbandment of the FPI 'Äî following a statement from FPI chairman Rizieq Shihab calling President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono a 'Äúloser'Äù 'Äî Democratic Party lawmaker Ruhut Sitompul said that Yudhoyono, who is also chairman of the party, would make no efforts to outlaw the FPI, in spite of their violent activities. Ruhut said that Yudhoyono respected the law by not disbanding the FPI. 'ÄúI must emphasize that Pak SBY will not disband the FPI. We live in a country where the law and the Pancasila ideology must be upheld. Therefore, we must fully trust law enforcers to strictly enforce the law against violators,'Äù he said. Senior politician of the Democratic Party Melanie Leimena Suharly meanwhile said that 'Äúthe President will likely take action if he gets support from all elements, especially the country'Äôs largest Islamic groups Nahdatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah because he [Yudhoyono] doesn'Äôt want to break the law'Äù. Such a tepid stance against the FPI has also been adopted by other political parties. Golkar Party secretary-general Idrus Marham said action against the FPI could only be based on the law. 'ÄúI know this sounds normative, but the fact is that Indonesia is a law-based state. The law should govern all aspects of life in this country. Law enforcers, including the police, are responsible for ensuring that everybody, including members of the FPI, abide by the law. So it should be the police who lead the charge against the FPI,'Äù Idrus told The Jakarta Post. PDI-P secretary-general Tjahjo Kumolo said that what the party could do was call on the police to take concrete action against the FPI. 'ÄúThe police, for example, should have no excuse but to follow up on the President'Äôs instruction to enforce the law against members of the FPI who commit violence. Simultaneously, the Home Ministry must implement the [newly endorsed] Law on Mass Organizations to crack down on the organization,'Äù Tjahjo told the Post. Leader of the PPP faction at the House, Hasrul Azwar, however, defended the FPI. He said the FPI could not be faulted for its actions because its members were fighting for the country'Äôs morality. 'ÄúThe FPI would not take over the role of the police if the police, as well as the government, were capable of enforcing the law on morality.'Äù Hasrul said the PPP encouraged FPI to resort to 'Äúmore peaceful means'Äù to promote their values. The FPI was officially established in August 1998 in Jakarta by a number of local religious figures and Muslim activists. The group has been associated with violence as its members have frequently conducted regular raids and sweeps in places deemed to be promoting blasphemy or immorality, with the authorities rarely taking action against the body. Leaders of the FPI decided to suspend the organization in November 2002 after the Jakarta Police detained chairman Habib Riziqie over a number of illegal raids by his followers. The suspension only lasted for a month as the group resumed operations later that December.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/07/29/political-parties-pass-buck-fpi.html,,2013
"Sat, July 27, 2013",Kendal clash no pretext to freeze FPI: Govt,"The government cannot disband the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) using the controversial Mass Organization (Ormas) Law following the deadly clash in Kendal and Temanggung as the group'Äôs branches in the two regions had not been registered yet, an official said on Friday. 'ÄúThe authority to control the organization that was deemed to have caused social unrest, is in the hands of the regent. And the regional administrations have used its authority to warn the FPI members not to conduct any sweeping again,'Äù Bahtiar, the Home Ministry'Äôs mass organization sub-directorate head, said. Bachtiar said that the raid conducted by the FPI that led a violent clash between the group and angry residents could not be used as a pretext to invoke the Mass Organization Law, which was deemed as a threat to democracy by human rights activists. The local FPI branches, he said, were not registered, while the law could only be applied to registered organizations. The government has come under pressure to freeze the FPI following the Kendal incident that left a pregnant woman dead. The police have named several FPI members as suspects for the violent clash. Bahtiar previously said that the organization could be subject to sanctions imposed in stages as stipulated in the Ormas Law, comprised of three warnings, temporary disbandment and permanent disbandment, should the regional administration have enough grounds to say the FPI has created social unrest. The ministry'Äôs statement came as members of the House of Representatives and social media users were calling on President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who condemned the FPI for creating a bad image to Islam, to disband the Islamic group. Democratic Party politician Melanie Leimena Suharly, who is also the People'Äôs Consultative Council deputy speaker, said that the President was waiting for the official statements from the Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah over whether the FPI should be dissolved. 'ÄúThe President wants to do it with the endorsement of all elements of society,'Äù she said as quoted by state news agency Antara. Several parties have said that disbanding the FPI would set a bad precedent for Indonesia'Äôs democracy and that it would not solve the real problem, which they said was weak law enforcement. Hafidz Usman of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the country'Äôs largest Muslim organization said that the government shared the blame for the clash, saying that the law enforcers have let existing brothels continue business as usual during Ramadhan, which has caused anxiety among FPI members 'ÄúFPI should not be allowed to conduct a sweep, because it was the task of law enforcers. Now, the law enforcers should dig deeper into the case and find the reason why the FPI decided to conduct the raid in the first place,'Äù Hafidz said, citing that during Ramadhan, brothels should be closed. 'ÄúIt'Äôs too much that the FPI should be disbanded just because of this incident. The perpetrators should be charged, but the raid was not a policy that came from FPI'Äôs head office in Jakarta,'Äù he said. Separately, National Police deputy chief Comr. Gen. Nanan Sukarna said on Friday that the police would use a humanistic approach in handling the FPI. 'ÄúWe should strictly enforce the law, but we also need to provide a solution,'Äù he said at the National Police headquarters in South Jakarta on Friday. 'ÄúIf he [FPI chairman Habib Rizieq] has realized that they are not allowed to conduct a sweep, why do we need to put all [FPI members] behind bars?'Äù he continued. However, Nanan denied the assumption that the force had been lenient toward the FPI, which was notorious for its violent raids on nightclubs, bars and brothels.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/07/27/kendal-clash-no-pretext-freeze-fpi-govt.html,,2013
"Fri, July 26, 2013","Stop vigilantism now, but don'Äôt dissolve FPI","Pros and cons over whether to dissolve the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) have been rife in the wake of a clash involving the hardline group and local people in the Central Java town of Kendal last week. After repeatedly promoting violence, resulting in social unrest across the country, now is the time for everyone to say 'Äúenough is enough'Äù to the FPI, especially given the passage of the Mass Organization Bill by the House of Representatives and the President'Äôs call for zero tolerance against FPI vigilantism. Many believe that the FPI could and should be disbanded soon, or else the state will totally lose its authority over the FPI and other radical groups. However, I do not believe that the state should be granted the right to dissolve the FPI or any other organization for that matter. Indeed the FPI has ignited problems and these issues should be addressed accordingly. The FPI has not only hijacked Islam but it has also abused democracy. But the state'Äôs disbandment of an organization that cannot be categorically identified as an evil, is an authoritarian move itself and thus endangers democracy. The FPI is an Islamic organization, but the behavior of its members represents vigilantism, which takes form in the way they attempt to take the law into their own hands. This is a common phenomenon apparent in societies in crisis, where the state is incapable of taking care of public affairs. In their book Vigilante Politics, Jon Rosenbaum and Peter Sederberg classify vigilantism into three types. First, crime-control vigilantism, which aims at overcoming rampant crime in society such as the case with the Esquadrao de Morte (Death Squad) in Brazil during the 1970s. The 'ÄúMysterious hitmen'Äù secret operation during the Soeharto era in the 1980s is another example. Second, social group control vigilantism, which is intended to safeguard interests, authority or superiority of a value system belonging to a particular group such as Ku Klux Klan in the US. Third, regime control vigilantism, which is established for power take over from an existing regime, such as seen in the Costa Rica Independence Movement. The FPI can be categorized as social group control vigilantism. Founded in the wake of Soeharto'Äôs resignation in 1998, this group'Äôs mission is 'Äúamar ma'Äôruf, nahi munkar'Äù (enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong). The assumption is clear. The principle values of Islam, as the ultimate religion, are under siege while the state is simply too powerless to fight for them. It is the Muslims that should fight against the enemies, by using anything deemed necessary, including violence for the supremacy of Islamic values in society. The FPI'Äôs name and banner clearly indicate this spirit. Although it can be positive in theory, as seen in the story of Robin Hood, generally speaking vigilantism is considered negative. The main problem with vigilantes, including the FPI, is the claim that they know the ultimate truth and have the right to impose it on others. They perceive themselves as 'ÄúSuper-Muslims'Äù who have the authority to protect the world order or restore it from chaos. Vigilantism also tends to be Machiavellian: The end justifies the means. Although it can be effective in the short term as a way to overcome crisis, vigilantism will only render social order dysfunctional in the long run. Vigilantism should be addressed properly by strict enforcement of the law. The use of bigger authoritarianism to get rid of smaller authoritarianism only paves the way for ultimate authoritarianism. The 2013 Mass Organization Law gives excessive authority to the state and undermines people'Äôs freedom of association, which contradicts democracy. Why, after almost seven decades of independence, does the nature of the relationship between the state and the people remain the same as it was during colonial times, where citizens were seen as potential enemies and could be scrutinized at every level? Instead of being enforced, even if to dissolve such anti-democratic groups like the FPI, to me, the problematic Mass Organization Law needs to be repealed or at least revised. If it is justifiable for the state to dissolve the FPI today but what will prevent it from dissolving other organizations by using the same pretext in the future? Since the FPI is a legal organization, the state could not just simply disband it. However, every single law violation committed by FPI members and its leaders, such as their persecution of Ahmadis, frequent banning of churches and the recent violence in Kendal, should be brought to justice. Everyone should play by the same rules. This is the real challenge with regards to reports saying that there are many powerful figures behind the FPI. Everybody knows this and that is why the FPI is free to launch its campaign despite mounting concerns and public protests. When society is in crisis and the state fails to perform its duties, especially in relation to law enforcement, it is highly possible that other FPI-like groups will resurface in different versions if the FPI is disbanded. Democracy is not something fixed, ready to use, out there for us to reach. It is an ideal based on the principles of freedom, equality and justice. Developing democracy through an authoritarian process will finally kill democracy itself. Vigilantism should not be tolerated. But disbandment of the FPI or other groups will not solve the root cause of the problem. Democracy teaches us not to negate the rights of others, including our opponents.

"Fri, July 26, 2013",National Police move cautiously against FPI chairman,"The National Police chief Gen. Timur Pradopo has ordered the force'Äôs crime division to set up a special team to investigate whether the statement of hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) chairman Rizieq Shihab, who called President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono a 'Äúloser'Äù, could be seen as slander. National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Ronny F. Sompie said on Thursday the team was looking to determine whether Rizieq'Äôs insulting of the President could be deemed a criminal offense. 'ÄúThe National Police will not sit and wait for a report [to start an investigation] since this concerns the honor of the country'Äôs highest leader. We will use the law that carries provisions against insults or misdemeanors,'Äù Ronny said. Rizieq issued a statement on Monday, calling Yudhoyono 'Äúa loser who spread slanderous statements and stayed tight-lipped about maksiat [immoral practices]'Äù. He was referring to a press statement by Yudhoyono on Sunday in which he criticized the FPI for committing vigilante acts. The President reprimanded the firebrand group following a clash between FPI members and local residents of Sukorejo in Kendal, Central Java, which claimed a life and injured three. The riot broke out following the FPI'Äôs attempts to conduct a sweep of the village'Äôs alleged red-light district on Thursday. Articles 134, 136 and 137 of the Criminal Code stipulate an individual who insults the president or vice president faces a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and Rp 300 million (US$29,100) in fines. The police, however, could not charge Rizieq with those articles as the Constitutional Court annulled the articles in 2006 on the grounds that they infringed freedom of expression. Early this year, lawmakers proposed reinstating the articles. The police may charge Rizieq with Article 335 on misdemeanor and articles 310 and 311 on defamation, which carry a maximum penalty of four years in prison. The police can only apply Article 335 based on a report. Responding to mounting calls for the disbandment of the FPI, Cabinet Secretary Dipo Alam said the government would not resort to such action because the organization itself had never been formally registered. 'ÄúThe FPI is just like an informal forum where people get together and hang out,'Äù he said at the State Palace. Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi, however, rejected Dipo'Äôs claim on Thursday, saying the FPI was a legal organization and was registered with the Home Ministry. 'ÄúIt is registered with the Directorate General for the Nation'Äôs Unity and Politics in our ministry. It is a legal mass organization,'Äù Gamawan told reporters on Thursday. Earlier, Gamawan said his ministry could not yet enforce the newly endorsed Mass Organization Law against the FPI, because it did not take effect until early next month pending the issuance of a government regulation for its implementation. The Mass Organization Law mandates the government to issue three reprimands to any groups causing public disturbances before finally lodging a formal request of temporary suspension to the Supreme Court. The Kendal clash and Rizieq'Äôs statements have stirred public outrage against the FPI, with some figures and lawmakers urging the disbandment of the group, using the newly-enacted law. On Wednesday, several hackers managed to deface the FPI'Äôs official website fpi.or.id. Bowing to pressure, Rizieq on Wednesday delivered an apology to the family of Tri Munarti, a pregnant woman who was killed in the clash.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/07/26/national-police-move-cautiously-against-fpi-chairman.html,,2013
"Thu, July 25, 2013",FPI apologizes to victims of clash,"Chairman of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), Rizieq Shihab, has apologized to the family of the woman who died during a clash between members of the hardline group and locals in Kendal, Central Java, and instructed all of the organization'Äôs members not to engage in raids and vandalism. 'ÄúOn behalf of the FPI, I apologize to the victims. May the deceased be accepted by Allah, and the injured be blessed with a speedy recovery,'Äù Riziek said in a statement issued on Wednesday. He also said that the FPI would pay compensation to the victim'Äôs family. 'ÄúThe FPI will pay for the education of the victim'Äôs son until he gets his bachelor'Äôs degree. We will give Rp 500,000 [$50] each month,'Äù he said. Rizieq also promised any of FPI members who were involved in violence could face legal charges and be dismissed from the organization. He also said that the FPI would withdraw a police report it filed against locals who allegedly assaulted FPI members or damaged its properties. 'ÄúBut if they were provocateurs who were actually responsible for the incident, the FPI would ask the police to continue legal processes against them.'Äù Kendal native Tri Munarti, who was pregnant, was killed in the fatal clash last week. She and her husband were on a motorbike when a vehicle allegedly driven by FPI members hit them. Three other people were also injured. The FPI members were reportedly attempting to flee an angry mob that ran amok following the FPI'Äôs raids of a red-light district in Sukorejo, Central Java. Following the incident, Central Java police named seven suspects, three of whom were FPI members. In his statement, Rizieq pledged no FPI member would conduct any kind of violent acts again in the future. 'ÄúFPI members are strictly prohibited from conducting sweeps and destruction of public property, let alone causing death,'Äù he said. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, several hackers managed to deface the FPI'Äôs official website fpi.or.id. On early Wednesday, the homepage of the site was turned into a picture of a woman in a hijab with a darkened background. Minutes later, the picture turned into a 'Äúfearsome long-haired ghost'Äù with a text 'ÄúHacked by Besideo7. Serius, gan [Serously, Sir]?'Äù. Then all the backgrounds changed to white with before 'ÄúThe FPI has offended the law'Äù, and 'ÄúUnder maintenance forever by fake admin FPI'Äù appeared Later on Wednesday, the top panel of the website was replaced with a banner of JKT48, a 51-member girl group, who are wildly popular among male teen. In a related development, Home Ministry Gamawan Fauzi said that his ministry could not enforce the newly endorsed Law on Mass Organizations against the FPI yet, because it could not take effect until early next month pending the issuance of a government regulation for its implementation. The Mass Organization Law mandates the government to issue three reprimands to any groups causing public disturbance before finally lodging a formal request of temporary suspension to the Supreme Court. Cabinet Secretary Dipo Alam, meanwhile, said that the government would not be able to disband the FPI because the organization itself had never been formally registered. 'ÄúThe FPI is just like an informal forum where people get together and hang out,'Äù he said at the State Palace. Separately, Deputy Chairwoman of the People'Äôs Consultative Assembly (MPR) Melanie Leimena Suharli has joined other lawmakers calling for suspension of radical groups, including the FPI, but encouraged to seek support from the country'Äôs largest Islamic organizations, Nahdatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah. 'ÄúSupport from both groups is important because they have a large number of followers. Once they make the move, all of their followers will follow suit, which make efforts to suspend FPI finally work,'Äù Leimena of the Democratic Party said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/07/25/fpi-apologizes-victims-clash.html,,2013
"Wed, July 24, 2013",FPI members arrested for Makassar raid,"The South Sulawesi Police have named three members of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) as suspects for ransacking a liquor store in Makassar, South Sulawesi. National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Ronny F. Sompie said on Tuesday that the three were among 50 FPI members who had carried out a violent sweep at Anugerah Store on Jl.

Ronny made statements on the case after CCTV footage of the attack went viral. The six-minute video was first uploaded on YouTube on July 19, a day after the fatal clash between FPI members and locals in Sukorejo, Kendal, Central Java. The clash has stirred public outrage against the firebrand organization. On Sunday, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono instructed a thorough investigation into the case and pledged zero tolerance against vigilante groups, including the FPI. Responding to Yudhoyono'Äôs call, FPI chairman Habib Rizieq issued a press statement on Monday, calling Yudhoyono 'Äúa loser who spread slanderous statements and stayed tight-lipped about maksiat [immoral practices]'Äù. Rizieq said that in Kendal, the FPI did not conduct a sweep, only a standard peaceful monitoring during Ramadhan and were confronted by hundreds of brothel thugs who planned to attack them. The Central Java Police have arrested seven suspects in connection with the clash, consisting of three FPI members and four Sukorejo locals. On Tuesday, Dozens of people under a group Kendal Community Solidarity for the victims of the FPI violence, staged a mass rally on Tuesday demanding the FPI to disband, as they deemed the Islamic hard-line group to have acted arrogantly as vigilantes. The group called on the police to arrest FPI Central Java branch representative Sihabudin and bring him to court for committing a series of violent acts. Rally coordinator Erwin Pasule then cited the latest clash between the FPI and Sukorejo residents and said the FPI'Äôs charge that the clash had been orchestrated by local hoodlums was untrue.

Separately, Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali said that he would intensify his communication with leaders of the FPI to persuade them into taking peaceful means in preaching about Islamic values.

Members of the public, ranging from prominent local clerics to young netizens, deplored the clash between members of FPI Temanggung branch and locals of Sukorejo in Kendal that killed a resident and injured three others. The riot broke out following the FPI'Äôs attempts to conduct a sweep in the village'Äôs red-light area last Thursday.

"Mon, July 22, 2013",Lawmakers urge govt to ban FPI,"Members of the House of Representatives have called on the government to take action against the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) following last week'Äôs clash between its members and residents of Sukorejo, Kendal, Central Java, which left a local woman dead. The lawmakers said the decision was in the hands of the Home Ministry. The ministry is responsible for managing the country'Äôs mass organizations and has authority under the newly-enacted Law on mass organization to take action against the FPI to prevent more violence. 'ÄúThe FPI has clearly violated stipulations in the law on mass organizations by committing violence. The government should take firm action against the organization, by implementing an immediate suspension,'Äù lawmaker Abdul Malik Haramain, who chaired a special committee tasked with deliberating the Mass Organization Law at the House of Representatives, told The Jakarta Post on Sunday. The National Awakening Party (PKB) politician emphasized that such a punishment was urgent in order to 'Äúprevent members of the FPI committing further violent acts against locals'Äù. Tri Muniarti, 42, a resident of Sukorejo, died after a car driven by members of the FPI hit her and several other people, including her husband, during a riot following FPI attempts to conduct a sweep in the village'Äôs red-light area last Thursday. Tri sustained severe head injuries and was pronounced dead upon arrival at Ngesti Waluyo Hospital in Parakan. Three other residents sustained fractures and bruises. The Mass Organization Law, which was endorsed in June, amid widespread criticism for its undermining of freedom of association, mandates the government to temporarily halt the operations of any groups that, among other things, fail to preserve peace and public order, as well as groups that attempt to take the law into their own hands. However, Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi said that the government could only act if it received recommendations from members of the public or the National Police, a stance lawmakers dismissed as 'Äúunacceptable'Äù. 'ÄúThe law says nothing about such requirements,'Äù Haramain said. 'ÄúThe law stipulates that the government can issue warning letters to problematic organizations and can temporarily halt their operations if they fail to respond to the warnings.'Äù Separately, Eva Kusuma Sundari from the House'Äôs Commission III overseeing law and human rights concurred with Haramain, saying that 'Äúthe government'Äôs reluctance to punish the FPI for what happened in Kendal shows that it is afraid of the radical group'Äù. According to Eva, a politician from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), the government and the police do not need any more reasons to punish groups such as the FPI, which has repeatedly committed violence and illegally imposed its will on the public. 'ÄúIt'Äôs crystal clear to me that the government has never had the commitment to punish vigilante groups, such as the FPI. It'Äôs unreasonable for the government to wait for recommendations in order to take action against the FPI or any other vigilante groups because it is the institution with the mandated authority.'Äù During the deliberation of the law, the Home Ministry, which initiated it, repeatedly gave assurances that the bill would be responsive to public calls for the disbandment of violent groups such as the FPI. Prodemocracy activists, however, doubt whether the law will address the problem and have called for a repeal of the draconian legislation. Activists said that the government'Äôs response to the incident in Sukorejo showed that with or without the Mass Organization Law the government would not take action against the FPI. 'ÄúIt'Äôs clear that the government won'Äôt deal with the FPI with or without the law,'Äù Elga Sarapung from Yogyakarta-based interfaith organization, DIAN/Interfidei, said. Responding to the critics, Bachtiar, the Home Ministry'Äôs mass organization sub directorate head, said the public should not force the ministry to take the responsibility as the authority belonged to the police. 'ÄúThe police have taken all measures to deal with the incident. It'Äôs too much to expect the Home Ministry to take the responsibility, particularly if people use the law [on mass organization] to put pressure on us,'Äù Bachtiar said. FPI spokesman Muchsin Alatas responded disdainfully to the calls from the House for his group'Äôs disbandment, saying that the group would suspend their operations if lawmakers enforced the law and stopped being corrupt. 'ÄúIt'Äôs the House that needs suspension because it has imposed a lot of suffering on the people through their corrupt actions,'Äù he said.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/07/22/lawmakers-urge-govt-ban-fpi.html,,2013
"Sat, July 20, 2013",FPI could be hit with Ormas Law,"The hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI) could be subject to sanctions stipulated in the 2013 Mass Organization Law (Ormas), following the clash between its members and residents of Sukorejo, Kendal, Central Java, on Thursday. As previously reported, a riot broke out in Sukorejo when residents tried to block members of the FPI Temanggung branch who were attempting to conduct a sweep in the village'Äôs red light district on account of Ramadhan.

According to Bachtiar, the bill stipulated that if any persuasive measures by the regional administration failed, the organization could be imposed with warnings. 'ÄúFollowing the third warning, should the organization still take part in activities deemed to be causing social unrest, it can temporarily be frozen, before finally being dissolved,'Äù Bachtiar said. Meanwhile, Kendal Police chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Asep Jenal Ahmadi said on Friday that the police had detained three FPI members, including the driver of an Avanza car who ran over residents, killing one and injuring three others, during the riot. They have all been named suspects, Antara news agency reported. The car reportedly crashed into the residents, killing Tri Muniarti, 42, and injuring three others, including Tri'Äôs husband. Tri was dead upon arrival at Ngesti Waluyo Hospital in Parakan, Temanggung, as a result of a head injury. The three other residents reportedly sustained fractures and bruises. The driver, who has been named a suspect, was identified as Soni Haryono, 38. The two other FPI members, Satrio Yuono, 22, and Agung Wicaksono, were detained for carrying sharp weapons during the sweep. 'ÄúWe evacuated 28 FPI members using two minibuses last night, except for the three members we detained,'Äù Asep said, citing that the police needed further information from the three members. The latest incident involving the FPI members has renewed calls for its disbandment from politicians as well as netizens, who have long complained about the group'Äôs antics, such as conducting raids on nightclubs during Ramadhan. Eva Kusuma Sundari of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) said she supported the calls to disband the FPI. 'ÄúI hope the Mass Organization Law can be upheld,'Äù she said. Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) lawmaker Indra, however, said the FPI could not be charged with the newly passed law because the riot had not been instructed by the organization. 'ÄúThe law can only be imposed on the organization, when in fact the riot in Sukorejo was solely the members'Äô personal responsibility,'Äù Indra said. Pro-democracy activists and several mass organizations have criticized the law for being draconian and called for its repeal. But many Indonesians, mostly those who are more liberal-minded and living in urban areas, are hoping the law can bring an end to the FPI, which they deem a threat to democracy and the state ideology of Pancasila.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/07/20/fpi-could-be-hit-with-ormas-law.html,,2013

One of the arrested men is the driver of a Toyota Avanza which allegedly hit eight Sukorejo residents. The incident left Tri Munarti, a 42-year-old teacher at state elementary school SD1 in Krikil, Pager Ruyung, Kendal, dead. Kendal Police chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Asep Jenal Ahmadi said the police were still questioning the three FPI members. They were named as Soni Haryono, 38, an FPI member from Muntilan, Magelang regency, and the driver of the Avanza alleged to have hit Tri Munarti and the seven others, and Satrio Yuono, 22, and Agung Wicaksono,22, two residents of Parakan, Temanggung regency who were allegedly carrying sharp weapons. 'ÄúWe sent home all of the FPI Temanggung members in two minibuses except for the three arrested suspects. We evacuated 28 FPI members last night,'Äù said Asep. The clash between Sukorejo residents and the FPI supporters erupted when several members of the Islamic group carried out a sweep in a red-light district in Ngrancah village, Sukorejo, on Wednesday evening. The FPI supporters demanded the brothels be closed due to Ramadhan, but the brothel operators refused. On Thursday, a group of FPI supporters returned in 10 vehicles and motorcycles and a riot broke out. Facing hard resistance from a far larger crowd, the FPI supporters decided to go back to Temanggung. It was at this time when the Toyota Avanza driven by Soni reportedly hit a group of teachers who were traveling on motorcycles, causing the death of Tri Munarti.

"Tue, July 9, 2013",Vigilante groups told not to raid nightclubs,"Old or new: Members of Indonesia'Äôs biggest Muslim organization Nahdlatul Ulama'Äôs (NU) Lajnah Falakiyah members take a sighting of the sun to determine the beginning of Ramadhan at Season City in Jakarta on Monday. JP/Jerry Adiguna Government officials warned Muslim vigilante groups on Monday against conducting raids on restaurants, nightclubs and bars during the Islamic holy month of Ramadhan, calling the behavior illegal. National Police chief Gen. Timur Pradopo said it was not the responsibility of civilian groups to carry out raids against entertainment establishment and only members of the police could undertake such an operation. National Intelligence Agency (BIN) chief Lt. Gen. Marciano Norman urged vigilante groups, including the notorious Islam Defenders Front (FPI), to refrain from conducting sweeps. Both Timur and Norman declined to comment on what types of punishment would be levied against vigilante groups undertaking raids during Ramadhan, which the government announced would begin on Wednesday. Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi said that the newly endorsed Law on mass organization could be used against the vigilante groups. 'ÄúThe law can be the legal basis used to disband problematic mass organizations after consent from the Supreme Court,'Äù Gamawan said, adding that his ministry no longer has the authority to dissolve mass organizations. The House of Representatives deputy speaker Priyo Budi Santoso supported the government'Äôs tough stance on vigilante groups. 'ÄúThe FPI may have good intentions but they must remember that we live under a legal system. Thus, I call on the FPI and other groups to abide by the law for the sake of public order,'Äù Priyo said. Eva Kusuma Sundari of House Commission III on law and human rights said the police must take action against the FPI if it embarks on such raid. 'ÄúThe police must not become allies of the FPI and allow them take over their job. We strongly call on the police to uphold the law and punish anyone, including members of the FPI, who use violence for whatever reasons,'Äù said Eva. Contacted separately, FPI secre-tary-general Sobri Lubis said the group had not planned to conduct raids during Ramadhan fasting month. Sobri, however, said that members of the FPI could independently raid establishments. 'ÄúWe never suggest that any of our members should conduct the sweeps,'Äù he said. Earlier on Monday, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono held a Cabinet meeting to discuss preparations for Ramadhan. In the meeting, Yudhoyono ordered his ministers to ensure that staple foods could meet demand. Staple food price increases are expected during Ramadhan, when consumption peaks. Yudhoyono expects that this year following the recent decision to increase the price of fuel the poor will have to shoulder the extra burden. After the meeting, Deputy Trade Minister Bayu Krishnamurthi said the government would continue conduct market interventions to stabilize prices in case of sudden increases in the cost of staple foods. Bayu expected that cabai rawit (green chili peppers) shallots, eggs and white meat would experience a steep price hike. Meanwhile, the Jakarta Administration ordered entertainment spots in the capital city to abide by Bylaw No.10/2004 on tourism, stipulating that nightclubs, discotheques, spas and massage parlors should close one day before Ramadhan; and on and one day after Idul Fitri. Members of various Islamic sects have started fasting on Monday, including the An Nadzir sect in Gowa, South Sulawesi. In West Sumatra, the Naqsabandiyah sect has even started their Ramadhan fasting month on Sunday, sticking to their religious calendar.

"Mon, July 8, 2013",Booze bill moves forward,"The House of Representatives has agreed to accept a draft bill proposed by the Muslim-based United Development Party (PPP), which calls for stricter regulation of alcoholic beverages, for deliberation by the Legislative Body (Baleg). The PPP proposal has received a second wind following the decision by the Supreme Court to abolish a 1997 presidential decree which had prevented local administrations from prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages. The court upheld the judicial review filed by hard-line group the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), which is notorious for its violent raids on nightclubs and bars in protest against practices that it deems 'Äúsinful'Äù, including the sale and consumption of alcoholic drinks. With the abolition of the decree, local administrations now have the freedom to ban the sale and distribution of alcoholic drinks within their jurisdiction. The bill is among the 70 prioritized bills to be deliberated and completed within this year as agreed by lawmakers during last year'Äôs plenary meeting. The PPP'Äôs draft had proposed a complete ban on all beverages containing any levels of alcohol in the country. Those who produce and distribute alcoholic beverages would face a maximum of 10-years'Äô and five-years'Äô imprisonment respectively. Consumers of alcoholic drinks could be sentenced to two years in prison. PPP lawmaker Ahmad Yani said that the Baleg had watered down some of the party'Äôs proposals, changing a total ban to stricter distribution and consumption. 'ÄúIt now includes stricter rules on production and levels of alcohol, as well as designated areas for consumption,'Äù the senior lawmaker said. Although the Baleg has yet to finish discussion of the draft, Yani said his faction would keep pushing for the endorsement of the bill this year, arguing that a legal vacuum on the distribution of alcoholic drinks could be exploited by those who could benefit from the situation. Under the 1997 decree, the distribution and sale of drinks containing more than 5 percent alcohol were legal if they were sold in hotels, bars, clubs and certain areas designated by the central government. The decree put those alcoholic beverages under supervision while the sale of drinks with an alcohol level below 5 percent, including beer, was freely allowed. More than 22 regencies and municipalities, including Tangerang in Banten; Bali; and Depok, Indramayu and Bandung in West Java, have issued such bylaws on alcohol control, although not all of them have yet been implemented as the Home Ministry had been reviewing the ordinances as they were deemed to contravene the presidential decree. The Home Ministry has yet to issue a new regulation, arguing that it is still waiting for an official copy of the Supreme Court'Äôs ruling. Some of the bylaws, which include a 2010 Bandung bylaw, violate the decree and put all alcoholic beverages under supervision, allowing their sale only in hotels, bars and clubs. The Bandung administration has stuck to its guns despite the Home Ministry'Äôs call for revision. A 2012 Bali alcohol bylaw adapted the decree, controlling only those drinks with more than 5 percent alcohol and allowing the production of traditional palm wine 'Äúarak'Äù under supervision. Arak is also used by Balinese Hindus in religious ceremonies. The legal vacuum could easily be exploited by firebrand groups, constitutional expert Fajrul Falaakh said. 'ÄúWith the Supreme Court ruling, the FPI and other parties could try for a complete ban. Some religions in our society allow the consumption or use of alcoholic beverages [for rituals],'Äù Fajrul said. With or without a regulation on alcoholic drinks, what mattered most was law enforcement, he said. Nasir Jamil, lawmaker of another Muslim-based party, the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), questioned the motives of PPP although he agreed that the distribution, as well as consumption, of alcohol should be tightened. 'ÄúBasically, we agree on imposing tighter limitations on alcoholic beverages, but not a total ban as we still have to study the damage of alcohol on society and the benefits of the industry,'Äù he said. 'ÄúAnd why has Baleg yet to finish the draft? [PPP] should not make it a political bargaining chip.'Äù",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/07/08/booze-bill-moves-forward.html,,2013

Personnel are expected to be regularly deployed to entertainment areas to ensure they compliance. Arie said the personnel would be dispersed across the city'Äôs five municipalities; Menteng, Gunung Sahari and Jl.

If an establishment was found in violation of the bylaw, the Jakarta Tourism Agency would implement sanctions ranging from a verbal warning, written warning, sealing the businesses and permit revoke. Chairman of the Jakarta Entertainment Establishment Owners Association, Adrian Mailite, said that his members would respect the Islamic holy month. 'ÄúIt has been years since the gubernatorial decree was implemented so we are used to it,'Äù he said. Rikwanto said on Friday that the owners of such entertainment establishments who violated the regulation would face imprisonment of up to three months and/or a maximum fine of Rp 5 million (US$502.9), as stipulated in a 2004 gubernatorial decree. 'ÄúThe public should report any business they witness violating the regulation,'Äù he said. 'ÄúAny parties, including mass organizations, are prohibited from taking the law into their own hands, such as by conducting raids on the nightclubs that remain open during Ramadhan.

'ÄúThe operation aims to create a safe and peaceful atmosphere for the holy month,'Äù the regency'Äôs newly installed police chief Sr. Comr. Irfing Jaya said on Friday.

However, the bylaws have not been implemented as the Home Ministry annulled them because they were in contravention of the presidential decree. 'ÄúWith the Supreme Court ruling, there is no other legal reason to annul any bylaws prohibiting the circulation and consumption of alcoholic beverages,'Äù said FPI spokesman Munarman on Thursday. The FPI, notorious for its violent raids on nightclubs and bars in protest against practices that it deems 'Äúsinful'Äù, filed the judicial review in 2012 after the ministry annulled all bylaws limiting or banning the sale of alcoholic drinks. Members of the FPI and Islamic People'Äôs Forum (FUI) rioted last year in front of the Home Ministry after it issued a regulation forcing regional administrations to annul the bylaws. Last year, the FPI raided minimarkets that sold alcoholic beverages in Tangerang. Head of the Tangerang FPI Habib, Muhammad bin Toha Assegaff, claimed that the open sale of alcohol had contributed to recent rapes in Greater Jakarta. 'ÄúAlcoholic beverages are closely related to adultery,'Äù he said. Under the presidential decree, the distribution and sale of drinks that contain more than 5 percent alcohol are legally allowed and protected if they are sold in hotels, bars, clubs and certain areas designated by the central government. The abolition of the law means hotels, bars and clubs will no longer have automatic legal protection to freely sell alcoholic drinks. Local administrations across the country have enacted a host of bylaws since they received legislative authority following the introduction of regional autonomy in 2002. Supreme Court judges Supandi, Hary Djatmiko and Yulius, who accepted the review, argued that the presidential decree had violated the autonomy law as councilors, as regional representatives, had been prevented from implementing the bylaws as demanded by their constituents. The judges also argued that the decree was to some extent against the spirit of Pancasila 'Äî the nation'Äôs five-point philosophical basis 'Äî and the 1945 Constitution. Moreover, according to the judges, the decree was also contrary to Law No 36/2009 on health and Law No 8/1999 on consumer protection. Sales of alcoholic beverages in Indonesia, the world'Äôs largest Muslim-majority nation, have soared by more than 20 percent annually over the past three years as the economy has grown at an average of 6 percent. PT Multi Bintang Indonesia, the producer of Bintang and Heineken beers, recorded a 30 percent jump in revenue to Rp 2.41 trillion (US$245 million) last year from Rp 1.85 trillion in 2011.

"Tue, June 11, 2013",FPI diversifies business to land conflicts,"The Islam Defenders Front (FPI), notorious for its violent raids supposedly in support of sharia, is diversifying. The Islamic defenders are now available for hire to defend your disputed property. The extremist group is now fighting housing developer PT Alam Sutra over disputed land in Paku Alam village, South Tangerang. Hundreds of FPI members were involved in a violent clash with the company'Äôs security guards and police when they tried to invade the land on the Prophet Muhammad'Äôs Ascension Day, June 6. Two police officers were injured and 11 FPI members arrested. The FPI was hired by the Ronah family who claim to be legal owners of the 2.2-hectare site. The company believe they had bought the land to develop a new housing complex. On Monday, hundreds of FPI members staged a demonstration at the city police headquarters, demanding the release of their fellow members and the arrest of 'Äúgangsters'Äù hired by the developer to guard the land. The police ignored the FPI demands and said the 11 people arrested would be investigated and brought to justice. 'ÄúThe detainees will undergo further due process because they were guilty of using machetes and knives in launching assaults on the company'Äôs security guards and riot police,'Äù spokesman for the city police Sr. Comr. Rikwanto said on Monday. He stressed that the police would remain neutral in dealing with the case and the two sides should go to court to seek a permanent settlement to their dispute. Rikwanto said the police were also considering a lawsuit against the FPI which they said had violated Law No. 9/1999 on freedom of expression. 'ÄúFPI has a right to stage a demonstration to protest against the house developing company but it should first report the planned protest to the police. Instead, the protesters did not express an opinion, but launched an attack on security guards and later on riot police deployed to calm the situation, on the Islamic holiday,'Äù he said. FPI Secretary General Sobri Lubis, denied that the FPI had been hired but said its main mission was to uphold justice and defended the Ronah family'Äôs right to the land because they had an authentic document of ownership. 'ÄúInstead, PT Alam Sutra has hired gangsters and police officers to expel the innocent people from their own land,'Äù he said. 'ÄúWe can'Äôt see such injustice occur and in this case we have an obligation defend to them, because they need our support.'Äù Sobri admitted that the Ronah family and their lawyer had asked for their help to take over the land. 'ÄúWhen we tried to help them, we met gangsters and police officers,'Äù he said, adding that the policemen were from Tangerang police. 'ÄúWe want the Jakarta police chief to discharge the Tangerang police chief because he has misused his people to help these gangsters,'Äù Sobri added. When questioned about the Betawi Brotherhood Forum (FBR) whose main business is guarding disputed properties in the city and surrounding areas, Sobri had no problems. The FPI may have to face the FBR because the front'Äôs main mission was to defend the needy and uphold justice. 'ÄúThe most important thing for us is to fight everyone who commit crimes and negates people'Äôs rights, no matter their ethnic, religious and social background,'Äù he said. FPI has often featured prominently in cases which put them in the peak of media attention. The existence and activities of the FPI have raised a wide discontent in society, taking the law into their own hands and preaching violence in the name of God. Many FPI members in various parts of the country have been jailed for their involvement in violent raids but the organization cannot be liquidated under the 1989 Mass Organization Law. In 2008, FPI Chairman Rizieq Shihab was sentenced to 18 months in prison for his role in an attack on a peace rally in Jakarta. In 2011, three followers of the Ahmadiyah Sect were killed in an attack by FPI members in Cikeusik, Banten, but the Serang District Court gave only light sentences to the killers.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/06/11/fpi-diversifies-business-land-conflicts.html,,2013

"Thu, October 1, 2015",No need to apologize for 1965 communist purge: FPI,"Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) has said that it is forbiddento apologize to the victims of the 1965 communist purge. According to FPI Patron Muhammad Rizieq Shihab, known asHabib Rizieq, an apology for the 1965 purge will lead to the rise of a communistideology and threaten Muslims. ""If you [President ""Jokowi"" Widodo] apologize, then the state must paycompensation of Rp 1 billion [US$68,000]. If there are 3 million families that means Rp 3quadrillion. The PKI could rise again,"" exclaimed Rizieq before screening the movie Pengkhianatan G30S in Majlis Talim Revolusi Anwarul Hidayah hall in Jakarta on Wednesday. If the government apologizes, he added, it would mean the PKI had donenothing wrong, implying that the purge was the fault of NU and its youth wing, and also the fault of the police and military. ""Ifthe PKI is not guilty, it means they deserve rehabilitation. And theconsequence is that the communist party will rise again"" said Rizieq. Moreover, he said, all assets of PKI members andsympathizers would need to bereturned, if there were an apology, including their houses and land. Thestate would also need to pay compensation for each victim. Earlier, Coordinating Political, Legal and Security AffairsMinister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan said the government would not apologize to thevictims of the 1965 communist purge and instead would focus on a suitable format inaccordance with Indonesia's recent condition.

"Sat, August 1, 2015",Ahok for Indonesia: A trajectory beyond 2017,"Jakarta Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama is one of Indonesia'Äôs rising political stars. He is considered loud and confrontational, which makes for much controversy in today'Äôs Indonesia. It was therefore with much debate that Ahok was nominated as Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo'Äôs running mate for the Jakarta gubernatorial elections in 2012. Those who praise the anticorruption efforts in the capital in recent years call Ahok the hero Jakarta needs. To govern Jakarta with success, one must find solutions for its numerous complex issues. Jakarta is the most populous city not only in Indonesia, but across Southeast Asia too. Concerns such as worsening traffic congestion, flooding, deteriorating living conditions and an inefficient bureaucracy all make for an incredible challenge. Transparency International ranked Indonesia 107 out of 174 on the 2014 Corruption Perception Index, and Ahok has emerged as a much-desired corruption-free leader. Ahok is a citizen of Chinese descent, an ethnic minority in Indonesia. Supporters of political and cultural pluralism applauded the choice of Ahok as running mate for Jokowi as a sign of a changing political landscape 'Äî a more fair and democratic Indonesia with a capital that is truly becoming a melting pot for heterogeneous political representation. It'Äôs a sign that Indonesians living in Jakarta are not being subjugated by prejudice but rather are living in harmony and with open-mindedness. In contrast, others openly expressed dislike toward Ahok. The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and its allies rejected Ahok as Jakarta governor when he succeeded former governor Jokowi who was inaugurated as President in 2014. The FPI propagated smear campaigns against Ahok using ethnic, religious and racial content. Ahok'Äôs outspoken personality angered some members of the city council when the scandal of the marked-up uninterruptible power supply (UPS) tender was made public. Both Ahok and city councilors argued intensely over the 2015 Jakarta budget proposal, and the budget was finally approved by the Home Ministry 'Äî a first of its kind for Indonesia'Äôs local governing bodies. Earlier Ahok attracted public attention for leaving his political party, the Gerindra Party of the Red-and-White Coalition, following its proposed appointment of local leaders by local councils as opposed to direct elections. Ahok proved his uncompromising position in standing up for the constitution and democracy, and showed courage to lead Jakarta without his former political backing. With the controversy surrounding Ahok, what would be the likely future of Ahok-style leadership in the country with the largest Muslim population in the world, which is also the world'Äôs third largest democracy? The facts reveal that Jakartans in particular and Indonesians in general demand a clean and effective leader like Ahok. In 2014, when Ahok served as Jakarta'Äôs vice governor, a group of national online bloggers published a book titled Ahok untuk Indonesia (Ahok for Indonesia), expressing the urgent need for Indonesia to have leaders like him. As Indonesia will hold the first simultaneous elections for local administrations across the country in 2017, a group of volunteers has initiated an intriguing online campaign through the website temanahok.com, supporting Ahok to run as an independent for the 2017-2022 Jakarta gubernatorial election. They aim to acquire signatures and copies of at least a million Jakarta residents'Äô identity cards as evidence of support for a non-partisan candidate by July 2016. The year 2017 will definitely be a test for Ahok. He may or may not gain support from political parties, but gaining sincere support from the people is essential when running for office. If temanahok.com is successful in proving legitimate support, Jakartans will have greater confidence to vote for Ahok in the election. If Ahok is elected as an independent incumbent in 2017, his role as governor will be acknowledged as a major historic breakthrough for Indonesian democracy. With several large infrastructure projects currently running, Ahok will likely harvest tangible results to prove his worthiness. Examples could be the operation of the first phase of the MRT system, namely the southern to northern line from Lebak Bulus to the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle, as well as other public facilities developed to host the 18th Asian Games by 2018. These achievements are important and must be taken into account as the 2019 presidential election approaches. Will Ahok then run for the presidential office in 2019? Most Indonesians may not be ready to have Ahok as president in 2019. And it would be impolite for Ahok to compete with his former senior, President Jokowi, who may run for a second term in office. If Ahok runs as vice presidential candidate, the opportunity for winning the people'Äôs acceptance may be wide open. As in the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial elections, Ahok was successfully elected as deputy governor despite being part of an ethnic minority. This success may be replicated at the national level in 2019 as long as Ahok runs as a vice presidential candidate alongside the right presidential candidate. Assuming President Jokowi is able to improve his performance and run again in 2019, Ahok would be the right vice president candidate. The pair has shown positive synergy in the past and may bring similar synergy to further develop the nation in the 2019-2024 term. As President Jokowi would complete his two official terms by 2024, it may then be considered appropriate for Ahok to run for presidential office. Assuming that in 2024 Indonesia will have more educated and open-minded people, Ahok has a great chance to run for president. With his currently frank and vexing political personality, Ahok will celebrate his 58th birthday in 2024, when he might be wise enough to rule the world'Äôs largest archipelago. If Ahok is elected as president, it would reflect a peaceful and harmonious nation in which leaders are selected based on objective rationales rather than personal background. Indonesia would gain more respect in the eyes of the international community, including the trust of major global investors keenly eying Indonesia. Will this trajectory become a reality for Indonesia? Only time will tell. _________________ ...

"Tue, May 26, 2015",Is criminalizing hate speech the way to go?,"Despite various efforts deployed to counter terrorism, violent radicalization remains a major challenge for Indonesia. The country is witnessing an unprecedented surge in the number of citizens departing to foreign countries to fight for terrorist groups. Earlier this year, the National Counterterrorism Agency (BNPT) estimated that at least 500 Indonesians had left for Iraq and Syria to join the Islamic State (IS) movement. Although IS is currently the center of attention, the militant organization, Jamaah Islamiyah, is reportedly regenerating with systematic recruitment and training agendas. Many have blamed growing radicalization on weak law enforcement and the lack of clear regulations to address hate speech in the country, although obviously this is not the only factor. Former BNPT chief Ansyaad Mbai has expressed concern about the weak legal framework. Currently, the only legislation to address hate speech in Indonesia is Article 156 of the Criminal Code on spreading hate, which stipulates imprisonment for up to four years for 'Äúanyone who publicly expresses enmity, hatred or insults against one group or some groups of Indonesians'Äù. However, this article does not make a clear distinction between valid criticisms and hate speech; and it only criminalizes narratives against Indonesians. Thus, it does not address the common rhetoric against Westerners or Shia Muslims in Iraq, a narrative often used to recruit Indonesian fighters. Several figures and hard-line organizations are widely known to deliver hate speech in Indonesia. The cleric, Abu Bakar Ba'Äôasyir, is known for his sermons in mosques, which boldly stated that 'ÄúGod has divided humanity into ['Ä_] the followers of God and those who follow Satan.'Äù He defines God'Äôs followers as people who follow God'Äôs law and fight for the implementation of sharia law, and Satan'Äôs followers as those who create obstacles to such efforts. Ba'Äôasyir also justified the 2002 Bali bombings and labeled Western tourists as 'Äúworms, snakes, maggots; animals that crawl'Äù and encouraged young Muslims to 'Äúbeat up'Äù Westerners. Recently, through Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid (JAT) chairman Mochammad Achwan, Ba'Äôasyir called upon his followers to support IS. Former chairman of the Indonesian Mujahedeen Assembly, Irfan S. Awwas, is also known for such speeches. He stated that people should not have criticized the executed Bali bombers Imam Samudra and Amrozi, as they committed their actions based on their individual interpretation and judgment. Recently, local jihadi groups such as the Hilal Ahmar Society Indonesia (HASI) have also been preaching on the importance of supporting IS. The group has been portraying Shiites as deviants and associating them with Syria'Äôs Assad regime, creating the impression that Sunni Muslims are victims of Shiite'Äôs evil deeds. Besides preaching in public space, HASI also uses online media to publish articles and videos that demonize Shiites and encourages the audience to support IS. The Islam Defenders Front (FPI), despite their detachment from Salafism, has been actively proliferating hatred domestically. A video of FPI secretary-general Sorbi Lubis was widely circulated on the Internet, in which he was recorded as saying 'Äú[K]ill Ahmadiyah wherever they are ['Ä_] Kill, kill, kill! If we do not kill Ahmadiyah ['Ä_] we will not be halal [clean] anymore.'Äù This speech reportedly contributed to mobilizing people to commit radical, violent actions against the minority group. Obviously, an individual'Äôs ideology will not be affected easily just by listening to hate speech. A reasonable person may see provocative videos by IS and not likely be persuaded to join the fight. Geopolitics and personal history play major roles in defining how an individual responds to hate speech. But those from poor families, with low education and an anti-Western bias may be more likely to be persuaded by the provocation. Influential hate speech is usually delivered by individuals who are considered respectful and charismatic, a la Abu Bakar Ba'Äôasyir. Audiences of certain mosques and boarding schools who are exposed to a constant stream of extreme ideas promoted by charismatic teachers and surrounded by others who believe likewise will be more swayed by hate speech. Many HASI members are former students of Ba'Äôasyir'Äôs Al-Mukmin boarding school. One challenge to addressing hate speech is the difficulty in defining what constitutes such action. A professor at Yale Law School, Robert Post, identified two issues to defining hate speech. He posed the questions; 'Äúwhen do ['Ä_] otherwise appropriate emotions become so 'Äòextreme'Äô as to deserve legal suppression?'Äù and 'Äúhow do we distinguish hatred from ordinary dislike or disagreement?'Äù Article 20 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights stipulates that national law should prohibit any propaganda that proliferates hatred on the basis of nationality, race or religion if it constitutes 'Äúincitement to discrimination, hostility or violence'Äù. Arizona State University'Äôs Center for Strategic Communication made a useful distinction between freedom of speech and religious hate speech by creating a four-point scale: (1) dialogue on religious differences; (2) unilateral condemnation of others'Äô belief systems; (3) dehumanization and demonization of certain groups with implicit message of violence; and (4) explicit, provocative message of violence. They argue that point (1) and (2) are considered valid criticism of other belief systems, while (3) and (4) are considered hate speech, as they encourage violence against certain groups. This categorization may be useful as a point of departure for the Indonesian government to differentiate hate speech from other forms of freedom of speech. Hate speech is not an independent factor and it does not always result in the 'Äúradicalization'Äù of an individual. However, it can be a strong shaper of one'Äôs ideology and can foment radicalism when it interplays with other factors. Hate speech strengthens social categorization in the mind of the individual, bolstering a sense of an 'Äúus'Äù and a 'Äúthem'Äù. In the authoritarian era of Soeharto, such speech would not have any room whatsoever. Today, the Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo administration needs to combat hate speech without harming other forms of freedom of speech, although some trade-offs may be inevitable. Regulating hate speech will not automatically reduce exposure to the promotion of violence in Indonesia, but it will help take one variable out of the equation. _________________________ The writer is a student research assistant in the the Indonesia Program at the S.

"Tue, April 14, 2015",The wicked issue of hate speech in Indonesia,"Islamic State (IS) movement leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared in 2014 the establishment of the Islamic caliphate, a new political system that challenges the existing world order. A number of FPI (Islam Defenders Front) activists in East Java, who often staged 'Äúhate speech'Äù rallies against minority groups, are now flocking to Syria to join IS. From ground zero, they post pictures that paint a picture of 'Äúthe glorious lives of fighters'Äù with their AK47 rifles. More importantly, they also encourage their sympathizers to follow suit in defending their oppressed brethren. The conflict in Syria has become the 'Äúopium'Äù to divert these recruits from their daily problems. It also created a market for 'Äúhate speech'Äù to mushroom. The rule of thumb to success in this business is as follows: The more you can demonstrate your hatred toward other groups, especially against Shiites because the Assad regime in Syria is believed to be Shiite, the larger your audience and the more respect you will get. This is a terrible problem and there is no simple solution. There are two extreme approaches to deal with the phenomenon. The first suggests that we, the society, do nothing and let the group do whatever it wants in the name of democracy. We may say only crazy people will support IS, so why should we bother fighting against its propaganda? But, of course, this approach is very dangerous because the youth are very vulnerable and easily seduced, many lives will be lost, families will be damaged and Indonesia'Äôs security will be at risk if they come home. The other extreme is what is happening in Malaysia, which reminds us of Indonesia under Soeharto, when oppression prevailed. Such policies will be unpopular and counterproductive because we will only create heroes of people who do not deserve such reverence, like Jamaah Islamiyah (JI) founders Abdullah Sungkar and Abu Bakar Ba'Äôasyir. In fact, the two were tried and sentenced, although confusion and suspicion of politicization marked the legal process against them. At the moment, we face the same confusion about the legal boundaries and enforcement of the law. So we need to first of all establish what Indonesian law says and how it should be enforced in the event of incitements of hatred, hate speech, recruitment, radicalization and other things. Second, we have to acknowledge that if no new threat is found in those acts, it is only natural that the law is lagging behind the development of threats. In the case of people who return home from Syria and Iraq after fighting with radical groups, should they face the law or not? The existing law is not clear about this issue so we cannot charge the people. But if we make the law clear, then we can enforce it and ban Indonesian nationals from joining the fundamentalist groups. We can also criminalize people who recruit fighters here. Without clarity in our legal system, the era of the 1980s will repeat with Indonesia and Malaysia changing roles. In those days, Indonesian hardliners fled to Malaysia because of the draconian law at home at that time. They chose Malaysia because they could freely organize Islamic radical groups there to be sent to Afghanistan. Today, Malaysia is cracking down on Islamists and Indonesia is relatively free, allowing Southeast Asian hardliners to flock into Indonesia to recruit and organize. To prevent that from happening, we need consistent enforcement of the law. We know persecution of religious minority groups is rampant in Indonesia. It is very damaging for national interests yet the law cannot intervene and there is no political will to address the matter. Such weak law enforcement and a lack of political will has given a license to the extremists to go ahead and do whatever they want because they know that they will not be held accountable. Other activities like vigilante behavior of groups who basically are bullying others have created a space in which they can engage in hate speech in the way that the state does not intervene because of fear about being dubbed 'Äúanti-Islam'Äù. It happened when Muslim and Betawi ethnic groups demanded that legitimate Jakarta Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama step down. It is true that Ahok did not receive physical threats and he was fine, survived and laughed the rally off, but we do need to think clearly about the boundaries because we need to know which acts are acceptable and which are not. If we give freedom to vigilante groups so that they can push the boundary of unacceptable acts that go unpunished, other groups will take the opportunity to follow suit. As we can see in the open recruitment of Islamists bound for Syria in many mosques in Jakarta, Surakarta, Semarang and Lamongan, many people decided to join because of the open space created. When recruiting, the tag line for IS is very alluring: 'ÄúYou are not joining a terrorist organization like al-Qaeda but an Islamic State that has territory, thousands of soldiers and assets worth billions of dollars, mostly from oil, such that you can directly be involved in the battles.'Äù For young bachelors, there is more on offer: to set up a new life with a wife whom the Islamic State will provide. Married recruits can also get more wives there as well. No doubt that hate speech also serves as a powerful tool to cement a group'Äôs cohesion by creating fear of otherness and establishing boundaries of who can be 'Äúinsiders'Äù of the group and who must be excluded as 'Äúoutsiders'Äù. But hate speech also has a lucrative business side. IS 'Äúemployees'Äù could be hundreds of people who benefit economically from the production of books, T-shirts, pamphlets, websites, flags, vests, CDs and others. For each line of 'Äúbusiness'Äù, there are also writers, reporters, creative designers, salesmen and accountants. How can we create boundaries then? We can start by saying that the law says what the principles are and then we can impose those principles consistently. At the end of the day, there is no single solution and there is a strong need for public participation so the debate will be healthier. We can emulate the reaction of the community of Facebook and YouTube users who demanded that social media administrators withdraw any posting that contains child pornography. We should make the same demands on those who use social media to recruit Islamists, who could be our children or relatives? Is it not possible for the user community to resist such postings and request that they are taken down? ______________ Weak law enforcement has given a license to the extremists to do whatever they want. _________________ The writer is founder of the Institute of International Peace Building and is pursuing a PhD in politics and international relations at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/04/14/the-wicked-issue-hate-speech-indonesia.html,,2015
"Tue, April 7, 2015",FPI members get seven months in jail,"A panel of judges at the Central Jakarta District Court sentenced on Monday two senior members of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), Novel Bamu'Äômin and Shahabudin Anggawi, to seven months in jail for inciting a riot. The sentences, handed out in two separate hearings, were three months lighter than the 10-month sentence sought by the prosecutors during previous hearings late in March. During the hearings, two panels of judges said the defendants were proven guilty of violating Article 160 of the Criminal Code (KUHP) on provocation. The judge presiding over Novel'Äôs trial, Iim Nurohim, said the defendant'Äôs behavior created public anxiety, but mitigating factors were that he had no criminal record and was polite during the trial. 'ÄúBased on these considerations and in according to Article 160 of the Criminal Code, the court declares the defendant guilty of provocation,'Äù Iim said during the trial, which ended at dusk. Meanwhile, the judge presiding over Shahabudin'Äôs trial, Wiwik Suhartono said the defendant had been proven guilty of provoking other FPI members who were facing police officers during the rally that turned into a riot. 'ÄúShahab led hundreds of protesters in front of DPRD [City Council], saying, 'ÄòPolice and Satpol PP [Public Order Agency] don'Äôt stand in our way. There is no compromise for Ahok. ['Ä_] Kill Ahok! Don'Äôt be afraid. I will take responsibility. If you go to prison I will too ['Ä_]'Äô,'Äù Wiwik said. He said after hearing the provocation, a number of FPI members and the police started shoving each other in front of the DPRD gate. The FPI members then hurled stones, pieces of glass bottles and animal feces at the police. A number of police officers were injured and some cars were damaged. The seven-month sentences were calculated from November 2014, when the defendants were first taken into custody, which means the convicts will only spend several more weeks in jail. The court gave them seven days to file an appeal. Meanwhile, in another hearing later in the evening, the panel of judges sentenced 15 other FPI members to six months and 10 days in jail for assaulting officials. This means they will only spend five more days in prison. Previously, the prosecutors charged Novel and Shahabudin as well as 15 other FPI members under Article 160 of the KUHP on provocation, Article 214 on assaulting officials and Article 170 on violence. The rally took place in front of the City Council building on Oct. 3, 2014. During the protest, the radical group demanded the council cancel the inauguration of Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama as Jakarta governor. Back then, responding to the FPI'Äôs relentless protests, Ahok said he would file an official recommendation with the home and law and human rights minister to disband the notorious hard-line organization as the protests were offensive and against the 1945 Constitution.

In all forums, conservatives groups, such as the Council of Young Indonesian Intellectuals and Ulema (MIUMI), the Indonesian Mujahidin Council (MMI), the Council of Indonesian Jihadi, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) and the Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) organization, among other conservative groups, raised their voices as loudly as possible, so that the voices of moderates could not be heard. Moderate organizations, mainly Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah, which have characterized moderate Indonesian Islam, played minor roles in the congress. Only a few progressive intellectuals 'Äî such as Azyumardi Azra, Komaruddin Hidayat and Masdar F. Mas'Äôudi 'Äî simply gave speeches and did not follow the discussions intensively. Let us examine a few of the recommendations. The first, which calls upon unity in politics, reflects Islamist political parties'Äô struggle to gain Muslim voters. It mirrors Islamist politicians'Äô frustrations, as their parties have been easily defeated by nationalist and secular parties from one general election to another. By calling on Muslims to unite, they mean that Muslims should choose an Islamist party and support all efforts made by Islamist politicians in the national power contest. Indeed, the congress was attended by many Islamist politicians, such as Ahmad Heryawan, the West Java governor supported by the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), and Djan Faridz, a politician with the United Development Party (PPP). Some HTI activists brought up the system of khilafah (caliphate), though they disagree with the current Islamic State (IS) movement in Syria and Iraq. This suggestion was not taken up. The third recommendation is a softened version of protracted debates on sharia. The actual mention of sharia, also in the fifth point, barely hides Islamists'Äô ambition for state recognition of sharia through its laws and institutions 'Äî though toned down in the appeal on supporting small-scale entrepreneurship in mosques, pesantren and societal organizations. The last three recommendations show the spirit of conservatism within the MUI. The fifth recommendation to be 'Äúon the alert'Äù of cultures 'Äúincompatible with Islamic sharia'Äù can be used as justification for radical organizations such as the FPI in Jakarta and the Front of Islamic Jihad (FJI) in Yogyakarta, which have forced many stores suspected of selling liquor to close. The voice of antipornography is also in line with the two radical groups, which limit the freedom of women; in 2013 the FJI was among those protesting the Miss Universe contest held in Bali. The fifth recommendation underlines a previous fatwa of the MUI that deemed secularism, pluralism and liberalism as haram (forbidden under Islam) without elaborating on what these words mean. The last recommendation clearly shows the zealous apologetic attitude, if not total ignorance, taken by the MUI regarding discriminatory and violent actions against minorities 'Äî such as against churches, the Ahmadiyah, Shiites and followers of other local faiths. Instead the congress only points to discrimination against Muslims overseas. As an Indonesian proverb says, 'Äúan elephant in front of your eyes is invisible, whereas a germ across the seas is obvious'Äù. Interestingly, some members of the congress reject the term bughat (rebel factions) for those who rebelled against the state. They ironically use the word to refer to some minority faiths. In short, the MUI has increasingly become the voice of conservatism and radicalism. Some activists of moderate organizations joined secular NGOs and political parties instead. This is a task for Indonesian Muslims and the government to tame radicalism in the council before it is too late.

"Fri, February 13, 2015",Why we should speak loudly of extremism,"The world has seen the brutality of the Islamic State (IS) movement as a form of extremism. All is publicly shown and IS seems to have proudly released the videos of atrocities it committed. The question raised throughout the world remains the same: Do those acts have something to do with Islam? For Indonesia, this issue really needs to be addressed as Indonesia constitutes the world'Äôs biggest Muslim-majority country by population and in Southeast Asia, IS supporters and jihadist volunteers mostly come from Indonesia. The recently concluded sixth Congress of Indonesian Muslims in Yogyakarta, organized by the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), did not deal with the issue. Unfortunately, congress participants were mostly concerned about political and economic issues as evident in their final recommendations submitted to President Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo. And more alarming is the fact that the organizers did not invite Ahmadiyah representatives and canceled invitations to Shia organizations, while on the other hand invited hard-line groups like the Indonesian Mujahidin Council (MMI) and the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). The MMI is renowned for its jihadist ideology; it was once led by Abu Bakar Ba'Äôasyir who is now supporting IS. The group is pushing for literal interpretation of sharia, similar to what IS has done. The media reported recently on a gathering intended to support IS in Makassar. Among other attendants were local FPI leaders. There are two things worthy of observation regarding the congress. First, the congress failed to consider the rise of IS a big issue while favoring an Islamic unity narrative to combat what they call the deviant sects (apparently Ahmadiyah and Shia). The congress, thus, has a political dimension of preserving domination. Second, MUI chairman Din Syamsudin once said that Shia was a legitimate madhhab (school) within, and hence a part of, Islam. He even once attended an international conference of Sunni-Shia reconciliation. The congress organizers'Äô cancelation of invitations to Indonesian Shia organizations therefore contradicts Din'Äôs standpoint. Worse, in the last few years MUI regional branches have often spread Sunni-Shia sectarianism narratives. The manual of the jihadist movement, entitled Idarah at-Tawahhush (Management of Savagery), written in 2004 by Abu Bakr Naji, promotes sectarianism. Al-Qaeda and the likes, including IS, use the book, which is available on the Internet. The book reveals the strategy of the jihadist movement, which starts from sectarianism that will lead to societal polarization and result in public distrust in the government and finally pave the way for extremist groups like IS to come in. This strategy worked in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Sectarianism that some MUI chapters are sowing through their campaign for a Sunni-Shia divide will endanger not only Muslim unity but also Indonesian unity. Some analysts say IS deliberately perpetrates atrocities to build its distinctive brand. Most likely the acts of barbarism are part of IS'Äô strategy of deterrence. Besides, it could serve as a means to woo potential recruits. IS has now emerged as a relatively self-sustaining 'Äústate'Äù, no longer a mere terrorist organization given its military force, economic resources and vast territory. Having said that, however, the question about a connection between IS brutality and Islam remains there. It cannot be denied that the way IS kills its captives is justified by scriptural sources, at least in a literal way of reading. For instance, beheading is cited in the Koran (8:12), as are crucifixion and cutting off hands and feet (Koran 5:33). Furthermore, capital punishment by way of burning alive is stated in several hadiths, or prophetic traditions, some of which are considered authentic and promoted by medieval Muslim scholars. Many Muslims may seek an excuse for the fact that violent verses or passages are not unique to Islam. Christianity has the same. By literally reading some passages in the Bible (e.g. I Samuel 15:3 and Matthew 10:34), it could be said that Christianity is a religion of genocide and inherently not peaceful. And like the case of Christianity, Muslims would say that the scripture must be wholly and comprehensively read given the fact that there are many other verses and hadiths preaching mercy. Cherry picking, they say, is the very problem of IS as well as Islamophobia. But still, that apology does not remove the fact that there exist violent verses; and their existence matters very much. One cannot ignore that IS theologizes and moralizes its brutality by those so-called violent verses. This theologizing looks appealing to many young Muslim men, even educated ones, as we know that the scripture is not an ordinary book in terms of its power to influence, and to some extent brainwash, its believers. Having that implication, Muslims should provide counterarguments to challenge IS'Äô ways of interpretation, if they really and wholeheartedly maintain that the extremism is not Islamic. There is no way to detach Islam from extreme thoughts other than combating the way of cherry picking the Koran. Regardless of the outcome of the Congress of Indonesian Muslims, the country'Äôs moderate Muslims should loudly speak of extremism and sectarianism propagated by IS through its brutality. Their silence will send the wrong message that IS is a true face of Islam. _______________ The writer is a graduate student at the Center for Religious and Cross-cultural Studies (CRCS), Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/02/13/why-we-should-speak-loudly-extremism.html,,2015
"Tue, January 27, 2015",FPI members questioned for flying IS flags,"The Makassar City Police are investigating processions held by the South Sulawesi chapter of the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) in Makassar on Saturday, while flying flags typically used by the Islamic State (IS) organization. South Sulawesi Police chief spokesman Sr. Comr. Endi Sutendi confirmed speculation on Monday that the police had issued a permit to the FPI to hold a seminar and convoy as they claimed they were only campaigning for Muslim leadership. 'ÄúUnexpectedly, when they took to the streets in a procession, they carried IS flags. The Makassar City Police are currently investigating the case. We will speak with the rally coordinator,'Äù said Endi. The FPI held the public seminar because they wanted to discuss Muslim leadership at the FPI regional headquarters on Jl. Sungai Limboto, Makassar. There were several speakers including FPI central board nahiy munkar (evil deed prevention) head Munarman. After the seminar, they then held a procession around the city while carrying a black flag, usually flown by IS. They stopped on Jl. Nusantara in front of the Soekarno-Hatta Port in Makassar, addressed the crowd and installed banners in favor of Makassar Mayor Mohammad Ramdhan Pomanto'Äôs policy of converting the area, notorious as a red-light district, into a culinary area. When questioned on Monday, FPI South Sulawesi chapter legion commander Abdul Rahman, who led the convoy, denied that the rally was done in support of IS, but said the convoy brought along the flag as part of an effort to familiarize the public, most of which has so far regarded the words written on the flag as those of terrorists, whereas in fact the flag is a banner of Islamic. 'ÄúWe wish to convey to the public that the flag, thus far used by IS, is simply a flag, or banner of Islam. The flag has existed since Prophet Muhammad'Äôs era and has always been flown by the Prophet'Äôs companions,'Äù said Rahman. So far, added Rahman, the public had been influenced by others into believing that the flag was synonymous with terrorism. 'ÄúWe want to straighten this out. We fear that the public would be afraid, or against tauhid (monotheistic) phrases, whereas in fact such phrases are always expressed by Muslims. So, I emphasize that the rally and the flag have no connection with IS,'Äù he said. According to Rahman, the convoy, involving around 100 people, had three aspirations. Apart from familiarizing the public with the flag, typically flown by IS, as an Islamic banner, the FPI also condemned the cartoonist who insulted the Prophet Muhammad in France and supported the Makassar mayor'Äôs decision to convert the area around Jl. Nusantara into a culinary area. Rahman acknowledged he had received a summons from the Makassar City Police concerning the convoy held on Jan. 24. 'ÄúI'Äôm ready to fulfill the call and explain the convoy,'Äù he said. He added that he would also visit editorial offices in Makassar to clarify reports regarding the act. Flying IS flags by supporters of the group, which was earlier known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), is not new despite the government ban. On Aug. 4, last year, the government officially announced the ban on support for IS and warned citizens not to join the rebel group'Äôs fight in Syria and Iraq. Last June, in Malang, East Java, a group named Anharul Khilafah reportedly declared its support for ISIL at an event in a mosque in June despite resistance from local residents. IS flags were found during the arrests of wanted suspected terrorists in Ngawi, East Java, and Jatiasih, Bekasi, West Java, in August. Two weeks ago, a planned mass gathering of supporters of IS at a mosque in Semarang was canceled. The gathering was reportedly organized Jammah Ansharut Tauhid (JAT), an organization established by cleric Abu Bakar Ba'Äôasyir, who is serving a 15-year sentence for terrorism-related offenses in Nusakambangan prison, Central Java.

"Thu, January 22, 2015",FPI members indicted for role in riot,"Two senior members of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), Novel Bamu'Äômin and Shahabudin Anggawi, were indicted on three separate charges on Wednesday. Prosecutors charged Novel and Shahabudin under Article 160 of the Criminal Code (KUHP) on provocation, Article 214 on fighting against officials and Article 170 on violence. 'ÄúThey face a maximum charge of six years in prison,'Äù prosecutor Norman said during the first trial hearing at Jakarta District Court on Wednesday as quoted by tempo.co. On Oct. 3, 2014, FPI members staged a rally in front of the Jakarta Legislative Council (DPRD) demanding that the council cancel the inauguration of Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama 'Äî a Christian of Chinese descent 'Äî as Jakarta governor. The protest degenerated into a riot after the mob moved from the City Council building to the City Hall area, where a number of cars were damaged and more than a dozen police officers injured after FPI members pelted them with rocks and cow manure. The police later arrested 20 FPI members, including Novel and Shahabudin, for property damage and provocation. At Wednesday'Äôs hearing, Novel told the panel of judges that prosecutors had insufficient evidence to hold Shahabudin and himself accountable for the October riot. 'ÄúThere have been many manipulations in this trial and there are a lot of things that differ from the dossiers,'Äù Novel said as quoted by tribunnews.com. He added that he had been slandered by prosecutors, claiming to have left the scene of the protest before it turned violent and therefore could not be held responsible for it.

"Wed, December 17, 2014",Ahok sends 30 mosque keepers on 'Äòumrah'Äô,"Rare opportunity: Jakarta Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama (right, wearing batik shirt) talks to several mosque keepers from all six mayoralties during an event at City Hall in Central Jakarta on Tuesday. The city administration sent 30 mosque keepers on umrah (minor haj pilgrimage) this year. Courtesy of Wartakota/Henry Lopulalan Madari, 65, will never forget the day when the Jakarta Mosque Council summoned him and said he was among the first 30 mosque keepers selected to perform umrah (a minor pilgrimage), courtesy of the city administration. 'ÄúI was excited. I was speechless. I started preparing right away,'Äù he told The Jakarta Post at City Hall on Tuesday. The father of four said he thought he would never go on a pilgrimage. Madari has been a mosque keeper at At-Taufiq Mosque in Pondok Pinang in South Jakarta for more than 15 years and earns Rp 300,000 (US$23) a month. He also worked as a security guard in a South Jakarta school, receiving Rp 700,000 monthly. 'ÄúWith the money I make, I can'Äôt afford to pay for a pilgrimage. I can'Äôt save a penny,'Äù he said. Asni, another mosque keeper, shared the same enthusiasm. The 64-year-old, who has been mosque keeper of An-Nur Mosque in Menteng in Central Jakarta for 10 years, said he hoped thousands of other mosque keepers in Jakarta would get the same opportunity. 'ÄúI'Äôm very happy to have received this honor,'Äù he said. There are 3,145 mosque keepers working in around 3,000 mosques in the capital. Jakarta Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama symbolically sent the 30 Jakarta mosque keepers on umrah on Tuesday. They will head to Mecca on Thursday night. The development marks the first time the city administration has set aside its budget to pay for such trips. The 30 mosque keepers had fulfilled the requirements set by the administration. They must be over 40 years old, have worked as a mosque keeper for more than 10 years, be able to read the Holy Koran, have never before performed umrah and haj pilgrimages, and have memorized basic Koran passages and verses. Previously, Ahok had vowed to send mosque keepers on umrah every year. 'ÄúI'Äôve noticed that mosque keepers have a very important job but are paid very little. I knew that mosque keepers wouldn'Äôt be able to afford umrah or haj, so I thought that paying for the mosque keepers'Äô trips on umrah would be a good idea,'Äù Ahok said at City Hall in front of the mosque keepers and their families. Ahok wished the mosque keepers luck and asked them to stay safe in Mecca. The governor, a Christian of Chinese descent, also reminded the mosque keepers to fully understand the Holy Koran, so they would not be easily influenced by extremists. He also reminded them to uphold Islam'Äôs rahmatan lil alamin principle, which literally means 'Äúgrace to all people'Äù, meaning that it did not discriminate against others, including those of different religions. Ahok said he still remembered that while he was a regent in Bangka Belitung, a mosque keeper had refused him entry to the mosque during a Ramadhan visit and had asked him to stay outside. The mosque keeper refused Ahok and said Ahok was a kafir (infidel). He said he was forced to watch from outside and sat under a tree. 'ÄúIslam is a beautiful religion but people have different interpretations of its principles. Islam does not teach discrimination,'Äù he said. Indonesia Islamic Council president Arman Zakaria said as quoted by beritajakarta.com that Ahok'Äôs move was a good example of tolerance and honor for the country'Äôs motto of Bhinneka Tunggal Ika (Unity in Diversity). Ahok, who attended Islamic schools from the elementary to senior high school level, is known for his stance against intolerance and the use of violence in the name of religion. He has been at odds with the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), an organization that was against his inauguration as Jakarta governor. The FPI has inaugurated its own choice of Jakarta governor. Some mosques are known to be influenced by hard-liners. One was Al-Munawwarah in Pamulang, South Tangerang, Banten, which was once linked to terrorism as it was led by Abu Jibril, the father of terror suspect Muhammad Jibril who was detained by the police in 2009. The mosque'Äôs management quickly denied the accusation, saying that Abu Jibril had become its leader after there was an absence of leadership in the mosque.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/12/17/ahok-sends-30-mosque-keepers-umrah.html,,2014
"Sun, December 7, 2014",Disputes in democracy,"Antara Soon after the establishment of a presidium to save the rift-plagued Golkar Party, another presidium emerged in Jakarta to 'Äúsave'Äù the capital from an anti-Islam force. The hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI), with support from the Jakarta Community Movement (GMJ), founded the so-called Jakarta Savior Presidium on Monday to oppose Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama, who was installed as the capital'Äôs legitimate leader last month. The FPI 'Äúinstalled'Äù Fahrurozi Ishak, the coordinator of GMJ, as its choice for Jakarta governor during its rally outside City Hall. The protesters claimed Ahok no longer had the authority to govern the capital. It was the latest move against Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent, who succeeded Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo after the latter assumed the presidency in October. The protesters said they hated Ahok because of his outspoken manner, arrogance and insensitivity toward ethnicity, religion and race. They suspected that Ahok would promote 'ÄúChristianization'Äù in Muslim-majority Jakarta. Ahok played down the FPI'Äôs move, which has in fact endangered Indonesia'Äôs nature as a pluralistic nation. Previously, Ahok recommended the dissolution of the group to the Home Ministry for allegedly violating the Constitution. While the noisy FPI will unlikely affect the politics of Jakarta, the presidium formed by a group of Golkar politicians who oppose incumbent chairman Aburizal Bakrie may determine the future of the country'Äôs second-largest party and hence the landscape of national politics. The presidium was founded by senior party figures who accused Aburizal of maneuvering to expedite the party congress only to prevent his contenders from ousting him. The rift between the two camps turned physical as a clash broke out between members of Golkar'Äôs youth wing at the party'Äôs headquarters in West Jakarta prior to the congress in Bali. Despite the opposition, the congress went ahead untroubled. As expected, Aburizal was reelected. Aside from reelecting Aburizal, the congress also dismissed at least 15 supporters of the presidium to save the party, which is led by deputy chairman Agung Laksono. Among them are Priyo Budi Santoso, Agun Gunandjar, Yorrys Reweyai and Agung. The dismissal was announced after mounting demands for the congress to take action against the party'Äôs 'Äúdelinquent'Äù members, who according to Aburizal had demanded something the party could not provide. The congress also mandated that Golkar fight it out to reject the government regulation in lieu of law (Perppu) on regional elections, which reinstated the direct elections of regional leaders. Golkar will lead the Red-and-White Coalition, which controls the majority of seats in the House of Representatives, to realize this goal. Instead of healing Golkar'Äôs wounds following double defeats in this year'Äôs national elections, the Bali congress has escalated internal conflict within the party. The presidium to save Golkar is now preparing its own version of a party congress in Jakarta in January next year by inviting all party members, including those taking part in the Bali congress. Agung confirmed that invitation letters would be sent to all party members. 'ÄúPlease, chairmen of provincial and district chapters from across Indonesia, participate in the next congress in January,'Äù he said. Agung said the party members had no reason to be afraid of threats and intimidation from various circles that would sabotage the meeting. The presidium team, he added, would ensure the safety of each participant. He said the congress would be held democratically without any pressure. The presidium, he said, would elect a young and qualified leader, with proven dedication and achievements and a clean track record. In other words, the congress is expected to elect a new, strong leader who will be able to move the party forward. **** After being criticized for merely building his image through his maritime vision, President Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo fulfilled his promise to sink foreign vessels captured for poaching in Indonesia'Äôs waters. At least three fishing ships were sunk in Anambas waters, Riau Islands province, on Friday. Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Tedjo Edhy Purdijatno said on Wednesday that the tough measure was expected to show the government'Äôs determination to fight rampant illegal fishing, which had been left unaddressed by previous governments. Tedjo said the stern action would not disrupt ties with neighboring countries from which the captured vessels originated, because all actions would be conducted in line with existing laws. Data shows that Indonesia loses around Rp 300 trillion (US$24 billion) annually from illegal fishing and at least 5,400 illegal ships are believed to operate in Indonesian waters due to the absence of actions aimed at driving them away. The plan received support from various quarters, including Indonesia'Äôs largest Muslim organization Nahdlatul Ulama (NU). 'ÄúWe hope the government is strict. Don'Äôt let conglomerates, let alone foreign conglomerates, enjoy the country'Äôs wealth themselves. There are still many poor people in the country,'Äù NU chairman Said Aqil Siradj said. Law No. 45/2009 justifies the sinking or burning down of foreign ships illegally fishing in Indonesian waters.

"Sat, December 6, 2014",Ahok asks Muslim youths to uphold tolerance,"Amid the angry criticisms aired by the leaders of FPI (Islamic Defenders Front), a hard-line Islamic group, against Governor Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama, Ahok encouraged Jakarta'Äôs Muslim youth, entreating them to uphold the values of tolerance found in the Holy Koran and the national motto, Bhinneka Tunggal Ika (Unity in Diversity). During the inauguration of board members of the Indonesian Mosque Youth Communication Forum (BKPRMI) at City Hall in Central Jakarta on Friday, the Governor said that children should learn about tolerance starting at a young age. 'ÄúThere are certain groups provoking other people to hate me because of my religion. This is what happens if you do not understand and uphold the Holy Koran,'Äù Ahok told dozens of new BKPRMI executives and members. The audience wearing peci (rimless caps) and headscarves listened attentively and applauded Ahok for his humor. Ahok recently sent a letter to the Home Ministry asking for the disbandment of FPI, whose protests against Ahok'Äôs inauguration have devolved into riots and whose use of violence in the name of Islam he deemed against the Constitution. 'ÄúAs the new board of the BKPRMI, you must also make sure that youths understand and uphold all that is written in the Holy Koran so that they will become good people who lead good lives,'Äù Ahok said. Ahok added that although he was Christian, he understood Islamic values like rahmatan lil alamin 'Äî an Arabic phrase that means 'Äúgrace to all people'Äù. He said that some groups in society did not adhere to these Islamic values of tolerance. 'ÄúI am sure all of you are smart enough to understand what is right and what is wrong. You must not be affected by people who stray from the values of Islam but claim to be defending the religion,'Äù he said. Ahok went on to say that the city administration had many plans in store for mosques in Jakarta. 'ÄúWe want to help renovate and build mosques in lower-class neighborhoods. We are also looking into developing green areas around existing mosques. Moreover, like Bandung [in West Java], we also plan to put up Wi-Fi in mosques,'Äù he said. Bandung Mayor Ridwan Kamil began installing Wi-Fi in mosques across the city with the hope that more youngsters would visit them in favor of clubs and malls. Ahok also said that the city would pay for umroh (minor pilgrimage) for more than 50 mosque-keepers each year. This year, he said, the city had already paid for 30 mosque-keepers to go on umroh. 'ÄúOne day, insyaallah [God willing], we also want to pay for Haj for mosque-keepers,'Äù he said. Meanwhile, Ana, a BKPRMI member from Cempaka Putih in Central Jakarta, said that the Muslim community in Jakarta had great respect for Ahok. 'ÄúWe respect Pak Ahok very much. I think what Pak Ahok said about upholding the principles of the Holy Koran and Bhinneka Tunggal Ika was right. We must not sow hatred against other faiths just because of one small difference,'Äù Ana said. She went on to say that the BKPRMI also respected the city administration'Äôs efforts to build and renovate mosques across the city and to pay for mosque-keeper'Äôs pilgrimages. 'ÄúI think it is quite unprecedented for a city administration to give us so much support,'Äù Ana said. 'Äî JP/ Dewanti A.

"Fri, December 5, 2014",The challenges of civil militarism for pluralism,"With their violent protests against the appointment of Basuki 'ÄúAhok'Äù Tjahaja Purnama as governor of Jakarta, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) has once again made news headlines. The swearing in of Ahok, an ethnically Chinese Christian, to the governorship by President Joko 'ÄúJokowi'Äù Widodo sends a clear message of pluralism to the Indonesian public. It is a message that was lacking under the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and one that is to be warmly welcomed in the light of the recent history of religious and sectarian violence in Indonesia. However, while the continued presence of militant organizations presents a significant challenge for pluralism in Indonesia, somewhat ironically it also suggests the possibility for a less violent future. The FPI is the most infamous of the many ethnic and religious militias that now proliferate across Indonesia. Yet surprisingly, in spite of the burgeoning numbers of these groups, analysis of data from the National Violence Monitoring System suggests an overall decline in levels of violence in Indonesia. This declining trend in levels of violence may seem counterintuitive in the face of increased civil militarism, but it might also offer insight into aspects of Indonesian pluralism that many commentators have failed to appreciate. The presence of militia groups has a long history in Indonesia. They were involved in the struggle for independence and non-state actors have long played a role in security provision. Under the New Order, paramilitary organizations were used as a vehicle for engaging with and controlling the youth. With reformasi the role of these groups has changed.  It is no secret that these groups are often involved in extortion and linked to criminal networks. However, Fauzi Bowo, the former governor of Jakarta, encouraged the participation of groups such as Forkabi and Forum Betawi Rempug in security arrangements in Jakarta and the police regularly quell conflict in the capital with the aid of these groups. In Bali members of militia groups have helped to maintain security during high profile events such as the Asia-Pacific Conference. While a potential source of conflict, these groups also provide a means to contain and reduce violent clashes involving their members and in many cases work for the public good of their local communities. The majority of the members of these groups are marginalized young men with limited education and little access to the benefits of living in one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Membership offers them a sense of belonging, a support network and even a means of political representation. In many parts of Indonesia these militias are actively consolidating their democratic footprint in local elections. These groups are becoming more civilized, and their continued presence raises the question of just what constitutes civil society, and indeed, acceptable modes of political engagement in the public sphere in Indonesia. The government response has been to focus upon the violent threat these groups pose, and strengthen repressive legislation, the so-called mass organization bill, Law No. 17/ 2013. Yet in the absence of policy informed by analysis of the causes and extent of identity based violence, this appears to be little more than reactive government in response to high profile incidents of violence by groups such as the FPI. Moreover, it ignores the 'Äúunofficial'Äù processes through state and non-state actors often work to manage conflict in Indonesia. Ahok has called for the FPI to be banned by the Home Ministry. The actions of the FPI should not be tolerated, and their civic right to exist as an organization should be withdrawn should they persist in their particular brand of violent exclusionary politics. The Home Ministry has the authority to ban any organization seen to be hostile to others on the basis of ethnicity or religion. However, no action has yet been taken against the FPI despite their alleged involvement in sectarian and religious violence over the last few years. The FPI continues to harangue and publically threaten those that they deem to be anti-Islamic and Ahok is the first public figure to declare his intent to see the organization outlawed. The FPI'Äôs latest actions may finally spur the Home Ministry to act against them, especially if Ahok continues to push for the ministry to enforce its authority to disband the organization. Nevertheless, if pluralism is to prevail it will not do so on the basis of rule of law alone. Even if better attempts were made to legislate mass organizations, this in many ways goes against the very values that Jokowi, by demonstrating his support for Ahok, is attempting to promote. The basis of the mass organization legislation is to treat all societal groups as a threat to be overseen and regulated and the law thus threatens to erode relationships based upon trust between the state and its citizens. The starting point for the possibility of Indonesia is diversity. It is religious, ethnic and cultural diversity that binds the country together. While identity-based politics are potentially divisive, at least on the face of things in Indonesia, there seems to be some basis for negotiating across difference and maintaining social order. That this should be the case, in spite of the increased presence of militant organizations and the devolution of government authority, is a question that should be carefully considered by policy makers and proponents of Indonesian pluralism alike. _______________ No action has yet been taken against the FPI despite their alleged involvement in sectarian and religious violence. _______________ Lee Wilson is a research fellow in the School of Political Science and International Studies at the University of Queensland.
