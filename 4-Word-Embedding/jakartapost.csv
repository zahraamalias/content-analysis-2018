The Jakarta administration has proposedÂ controversial changes to the 2018 draft budget, includingÂ scrappingÂ trillions of rupiah of capital investment for six city-owned companies to accommodate Â key programs initiated by Anies and his deputy Sandiaga Uno, such as the OK OCE entrepreneurship program, Â zero down-payment housing scheme, Â Jakarta Smart Card Plus (KJP Plus) and the Jakarta Health Card Plus (KJP Plus).OtherÂ controversialÂ changes include the proposedÂ Governor's Team for Development Acceleration (TGUPP)Â with 73 members and a budget ofÂ Rp 28 billion,Â from theÂ previousÂ budgetÂ of Rp 2.3 billionÂ with 15 members. Before it wasÂ approved, the plenary session saw councillors voice their concerns about the budget. Following the approval, the draft budget will be submitted to the Home Ministry to be evaluatedÂ within 15 days. Councillor Syarif said he was optimistic that the ministry would approve the budget. â€œEven if there is an evaluation, it will only cover administrative issues, not figures.â€ù Earlier, online platform Kawal Jakarta called on the administration to explain the inflated draft budget. In late October, the budget stood at Rp 74 trillion,Â only to soar to Rp 77.1 trillion in two weeks.

The party said the Perppu, issued by President Joko â€œJokowiâ€ù Widodo last week, was a threat to freedom of assembly and democracy. â€œA restriction on the freedom of assembly will stir up conflict,â€ù Democratic Party executive Agus Hermanto said. Jokowi issued the Perppu a few months after announcing a plan to disband Islamist group Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), which is considered anti-Pancasila as it promotes the creation of an Islamic state in Indonesia.Â  The government has said that the 2013 Mass Organizations Law, which requires the government to file a request with a court to ban a mass group, had stymied the governmentâ€™s efforts to safeguard state ideology Pancasila and national unity. Besides the Democratic Party, two other opposition parties â€“ the Gerindra Party and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) â€“ and the National Mandate Party (PAN), which is part of the government coalition, have also criticized the Perppu.

"Tue, June 13, 2017| 03:19 pm","Vigilantism: A relic of the past, now threatening the future","Indonesians may feel relieved now for the government and police have acted swiftly and firmly on cases of vigilantism done by radical group Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) towards people who commented on the pornographic case involving the groupâ€™s leader Rizieq Shihab. National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian said that the vigilantism violated the laws and would be firmlyÂ dealt with. Two men directly involved in intimidating a 15 year old boy of Chinese descent in East Jakarta have been arrested. Solok Police chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Susmewalati Rosya was replaced over her inability to prevent the persecution of a physician at Solok Regional Hospital, Fiersa Lovita. It is in our hope that other vigilantism cases will be handled justly by the national police. So far, the Joko â€œJokowiâ€ù Widodoâ€™s administration shows commitment to uphold the rule of law and to punish those who violate the basic principles of the Unitary State of Indonesia, state principles Pancasila and state motto Bhinneka Tunggal Ika (Unity in Diversity). The purpose of the radical group members are clear, they are committing a political terror to silence the people and to discourage positive reaction towards governmentâ€™s action. More specifically, they want to spread anti-Jokowi sentiment on the grassroots level. The government had previously banned the anti-Pancasila and anti-diversity Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI). While FPI is not banned (yet), there are a lot of indications that FPI sponsors various anti-Pancasila and anti-diversity sentiments. Rizieq has been repeatedly reported to the National Police's Criminal Investigation Department (Bareskrim) for his various public statements that contain elements of religious blasphemy, insults on the countryâ€™s first president Sukarno, Pancasila, and Sundanese people. It was Sukmawati Sukarnoputri who reported Rizieq for his insult on Sukarno and Pancasila, which stated that, â€œIn Sukarnoâ€™s Pancasila, belief in one and only god [the first principle] is on the butt, while the Jakarta Charterâ€™s is in the mind.â€ùÂ  The meaning is clear, Rizieq wishes to reinstate the Jakarta Charterâ€™s version of the Pancasila, implying a more Islamic Indonesia that upholds sharia law. He aims to change the revolutionary spirit of our founding fathers, who did not want to see Indonesia become an Islamic country, due to the countryâ€™s diversity principle. Hence, it is obvious that Rizieq has violated the essence of the first Pancasila principle which has been recognized as the stateâ€™s foundation. Rizieq has been named suspect in a pornography case, with other cases still in the investigation process. These cases can lead to the disbandment of FPI in Indonesia. The last National Awakening Day commemoration on May 20 gave a ray of hope since the government and various political organization seized the moment to emphasize the importance of defending our unity, the pluralistic Indonesian nation that embraces various cultures and traditions including that of Chinese-descent. Jokowi brings back a habit from Sukarnoâ€™s regime in celebrating the birth of Pancasila every June 1. The celebration holds a significant meaning since on June 1 1945, Sukarno presented the basic principles of Pancasila as state foundation in the BPUPKI meeting, supported by the countryâ€™s founding fathers. Sukarno firmly stated that Pancasila reflects the main characteristics of the nation: upholding interreligious tolerance, pluralistic Indonesian nation, a just and civilized humanity, democracy, and law that guarantees social justice. Our founding fathers clearly intended a nation that is against sharia, that upholds democracy, against racism, against vigilantism and other human right violations, and also against corruption that eats away peopleâ€™s welfare. The motto Bhinneka Tunggal Ika emphasizes this anti-racism view and shows that Indonesia is against the tyranny of majority and oppression towards minority.Â  Indonesian government under Jokowi administrationâ€™s firm stance against vigilantism or intimidation has been a correct one. Vigilantism is an obvious crime that violates not only the law but also Pancasila.Â  To gather peopleâ€™s support in defending the state, Pancasila, our diversity and the constitution, it is important for the government to spread awareness of the past. Under the New Order, there were a lot of violations of the basic principles of the nation. From 1965 to 1967, Soehartoâ€™s regime not only supported but also led the mass killings of millions of innocents, capturing and prisoning hundreds of thousands, and persecuting many others. Hundreds of thousands of prisoners of conscience and persecution of those seen as leftist continued for decades. All these violations of law and Pancasila happened without adequate legal process. Ironically, Soeharto justified these violations, saying that he was upholding Pancasila and implementing the constitution.Â  Now, several figures who rely on the support of Islamic radical organizations â€“that wish to turn Indonesia to an Islamic state based on sharia lawâ€” are a part of political force involved in those past violations. They are also those who become opposition of the Jokowi administration, who want to continue the corrupted system that has disadvantaged the people. If the 2019 presidential election runs similarly with the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election, with money politics and intimidation based on race and religion and other legal problems, these people can once again lead the nation.

With intolerance rising and the call for the creation of a global Islamic caliphate gaining traction even at the nationâ€™s state universities, those who believe the state ideologyâ€”formulated by the nationâ€™s founding fathers in 1945â€”can no longer stay silent and have begun to stand up for it. Pancasila, proposed by first president Sukarno as the national consensus that could unify millions of Indonesians regardless of their beliefs and ideologies, is essentially the belief in one God, humanity, unity, consensus and social justice. It is then simply understood as an ideology of tolerance.Against Pancasila: Female members of hard-line Islamic organization Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) stage a rally to promote the establishment of an Islamic caliphate in Malang, East Java. (Kompas.com/File) For many, Pancasila is the final consensus and further debate over its compatibility is unnecessary.Â  Seasoned lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis, for instance, said he and his fellow advocates would take part in the effortÂ to protect the nationâ€™s unity by promoting Pancasila. â€œPancasila is our ultimate solution. There should be no compromise when it comes to Pancasila,â€ù he said recently.Â Â  On Monday, hundreds of lawyers grouped under the Indonesian Advocates Association (Peradi) pledged their support for Pancasila, which literally means five principles.

A meaningful dialogue is required to help the country regain the genuine values of Pancasila as a way to draw a new social contract â€” something missing after the New Order.(JP/File) Lawyers are not the only profession feeling the need to renew their pledge of support for Pancasila. A group of Anthropologists calling themselves Anthropologist Movement for Indonesia has expressed to President Joko â€œJokowiâ€ù Widodo that Indonesiaâ€™s diversity is at risk, as people who do not share Pancasila values are now becoming more assertive and dominant.Â  â€œOur unity in diversity is under threat. We are concerned about this situation and we want the President to know. We, anthropologists, believe that Indonesia should be a pluralist nation that respects all people no matter their religion, ethnicity and political views,â€ù the groupâ€™s spokesman, Yando Zakaria, said in a meeting with Jokowi at the State Palace on the same day. Among the anthropologists attending the meeting were Meutia F. Sarwono, P.M Laksono, Amri Marzali, Iwan Meulia Pirous and Kartini Sjahrir. â€œWe have discussed the current situation in Indonesia in the past few months and we have come to the conclusion that Indonesia is under the threat of rising intolerance,â€ù Yando added.

The anthropologists have called on Jokowi to act fast and tough on intolerant groups. The President has saidÂ he will gebuk (clobber) intolerant groups who seek to replace or act against Pancasila values and the Constitution. The term gebuk, analysts said, showed that Jokowi had taken the threat against Pancasila seriously. However, critics said Jokowiâ€™s choice of word could bring the specter of authoritarianism back to the country.

We have been operating for more than 20 years peacefully.

Thus the government must uphold the law and not act arbitrarily.â€ù The government has recommended banning the HTI over its activities that are deemed contradictory to the Pancasila state ideology. The move comes following a string of sectarian rallies in the countryâ€™s capital and other provinces.

Deputy chairman of House of Representatives Commission II, which oversees regional administrations, Ahmad Riza Patria, reminded the government that Law No. 17/2013 on mass organizations required the government to issue official warnings to any organization deemed problematic. Citing the law, the politician from the Gerindra Party further highlighted the involvement of the courts in the process, saying that the government could take any â€œproblematicâ€ù organization to court if all warnings were ignored. â€œTherefore, the government cannot arbitrarily ban any [mass] organization.

"Sat, March 18, 2017| 09:02 am",Police target â€˜land mafiaâ€™,"President Joko â€œJokowiâ€ù Widodo knows he has set himself a herculean task with his agrarian reform. However, on Friday, his administration took a major step forward when the National Police in cooperation with the Agrarian and Spatial Planning Ministry pledged to take stern action against rampant so-called â€œland mafiaâ€ù practices in the country. The two institutions signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to pave the way for police to crack down on such practices and resolve land conflicts, which in the past have seen the involvement of private and state actors, including the police themselves. â€œWe want to eradicate the land mafia [...] they have been toying with law enforcement,â€ù National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian said after the MoU signing. The general also acknowledged that police personnel had colluded with the land mafia. â€œ[When it comes to] dealing with our ranks, [the mafia] knows the tricks,â€ù Tito said. He also admitted the land mafia used bribery as a shortcut to get land disputes settled. Tito said the police and the ministry would form a special team within a month to forge ways to tackle problems surrounding issues such as the overlapping of authority among agencies, a messy land ownership database, poor access to land certification and illegal levies, among other issues. The MoU also covers an agreement to speed up the certification of land plots owned by the National Police. â€œThere is a total of 83 million square meters of land owned by the police that do not have certificates,â€ù Tito said. Jokowi has promoted his agrarian reform plan as a key to reducing poverty as well as narrowing the equality gap. The reform agenda includes the granting of 21.7 million hectares of idle land to customary peoples and poor farmers to improve their welfare and reduce economic disparity. But land problems, which could seriously hamper the reform plan, have been a major problem for many years, with disputes involving big companies, especially farming and mining firms, often resulting in social conflict, as a result of the involvement of police and military personnel. Observers have also noted other common land mafia practices in the country, including falsification of land-ownership certificates involving collusion between corporations and officials from different government institutions. Agrarian and Spatial Planning Minister Sofyan Djalil said his ministry had allocated Rp 2 trillion (US$150 million) from the state budget this year to issue 5 million land certificates. The target will be increased to 7 million certificates next year and 9 million the year after. â€œOnly 44 percent of the total land assets in Indonesia have been certified. Thereâ€™s a long way to go,â€ù he said. Separately, Office of the Presidential Staff (KSP) chief Teten Masduki acknowledged it would be an arduous road toward achieving the desired result. â€œItâ€™s certainly ambitious,â€ù Teten told reporters on the sidelines of the fifth Congress of Indigenous People of the Archipelago in Tanjung Gusta in North Sumatra. KSP data show that, of the total target of 4.5 million hectares of land to be distributed to farmers, only around 63,900 ha and 123,280 ha were processed in 2015 and in the first eight months of 2016, respectively. Of the targeted 4.5 million hectares of land to be legalized by 2019, only 424,573 ha had been completed as of 2016. Teten, however, insisted that the land-redistribution plan would take the side of small-scale farmers, and not companies, especially those running palm oil plantations â€” a longstanding driver of deforestation and forest fires. â€œThe agrarian reform plan will not pave way for the opening of new oil palm plantations. The government wants companies to concentrate on developing their downstream industry,â€ù Teten said. Chairman of the National Council of Agrarian Reform Consortium (KPA) Iwan Nurdin said he was not very impressed by the agreement. â€œThose two institutions are the ones with the most officials who tend to abuse their authority in helping the land mafia,â€ù he said.

"Fri, March 3, 2017| 07:37 am",Saudi king calls for moderate Islam,"For decades Wahhabism, the strict strain of Islam that promotes a literal interpretation of the Quran, has been Saudi Arabiaâ€™s predominant faith, and since the 1970s the oil-rich kingdom has been generous in sending funds to other Muslim countries to promote this conservative version of Islam. Now that Wahhabism has been linked with radicalism and even terrorism, the Saudi government has stepped up its campaign to counter that perception and the state visit of King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud to Indonesia, where religious conservatism has gained ground alongside frequent terrorist attacks, was part of the public relations campaign. After dealing with business on the first day of his visit, King Salman on Thursday kicked off his charm offensive in a speech during a 30-minute special session at the House of Representatives, calling for a united front to deal with what he termed â€œa clash of civilizationsâ€ù and terrorism. â€œThe challenges that the Muslim community and the world in general faces, like terrorism and the clash of civilizations and the lack of respect for a countryâ€™s sovalso ereignty, require us to unite in dealing with these challenges,â€ù the monarch said in his two-minute speech, which was interrupted by rounds of applause from members of the House and guests, including former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and former vice president Try Sutrisno. Later in his meetings with leaders of the countryâ€™s major Islamic organizations, the octogenarian king promoted a tolerant version of Islam as the key in the fight against terrorism and radicalism. Religious Affairs Minister Lukman Hakim Saifudin, who had organized the meeting, said Indonesia and Saudi Arabia agreed to promote a moderate version of Islam. â€œThe two countries have come to an understanding that we would prioritize the promotion of Islam as rahmatan lil alamin [blessing for the universe]. What is needed to maintain the stability of global civilization is the moderation of Islam,â€ù said Lukman, who joined the 30-minute session at the State Palace on Wednesday. President Joko â€œJokowiâ€ù Widodo attended. During the session, three Muslim scholars were given the chance to speak directly to the monarch, including Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) chairman Maruf Amin, who issued an edict last year calling for the prosecution of Jakarta Governor Basuki â€œAhokâ€ù Tjahja Purnama for allegedly insulting the Quran. Earlier on Wednesday, King Salman and President Jokowi witnessed the signing of 11 agreements, including one addressing the issue of transnational crimes and global extremism, radicalism and terrorism. To further bolster its counterterrorism campaign, the Saudi government offered free haj trips for family members of personnel of the National Policeâ€™s counterterrorism squad Densus 88 who were killed while on duty. To further burnish his credentials as a promoter of moderate Islam, King Salman is expected to hold an interfaith forum on Friday, shortly before departing for Brunei Darussalam. Despite the visiting monarchâ€™s pledge to join efforts to counter radicalism, the Saudi government continues to promote its conservative brand of Islam. Saudi Arabia is likely to step up its campaign to spread its version of Islam as it plans to open new campuses of the Saudi-funded Islamic and Arabic College of Indonesia (LIPIA) in Makassar, Surabaya and Medan. Currently, LIPIA only has a campus in Jakarta. Students studying at LIPIA will pay no tuition fees, as they receive Saudi-funded scholarships. Students will also receive a monthly stipend while studying at the institute. The college is known for graduating students ingrained with the conservative strain of Islam, including convicted terrorist Aman Abdurrahman, who has been known for his efforts to spread Islamic State (IS) movement propaganda. Alongside the Indonesian Society for the Propagation of Islam (DDII), LIPIA has been the primary beneficiary of Saudi funding in the country. Human rights groups have expressed concerns that conservative clerics in the country are promoting an agenda that conforms with the ideals of Wahabbism, including the call for the persecution of minority Muslim groups like Shiites and Ahmadiyah members.

Following an anti-Ahok rally in Jakarta on Oct. 14, Muslims staged similar protests in Surabaya, East Java, and Bandung, West Java, on Friday. Another rally is being planned in Padang, West Sumatra. The protesters want the Jakarta governor sent to prison for an allegedly blasphemous speech made in Thousand Islands, North Jakarta, on Sept. 27. In Surabaya, thousands of Muslims grouped under the East Java United Muslims Community Movement (GUIB) staged rallies in front of the East Java Police headquarters and East Java High Prosecutorâ€™s Office, voicing their demands. Representing 70 Muslim organizations, the protestors urged the police to arrest and question Ahok for insulting the Quran. â€œArrest and jail Ahok, the man who insults the Quran,â€ù East Java GUIB secretary-general Muhammad Yunus said in a speech. Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) spokesperson Ismail Yusanto expressed a similar sentiment, urging the government to take stern action against Ahok for blasphemy. â€œAhok consciously said that people who do not vote for him because of Surah Al-Maidah 51 had been lied to. This means that he consciously called the Quran a source of lies,â€ù Ismail stated. The issue began when Ahok spoke in front of Thousand Islands residents and Jakarta administration officials about voting rights. The governor related the issue to Surah Al-Maidah 51, which many Muslims perceive as prohibiting them from voting for non-Muslim leaders. â€œIn your hearts, Bapak and Ibu may not vote for me because [you have been] lied to by Surah al-Maidah, verse 51, etc. It is your right. So you do not need to feel uneasy if you cannot vote for me because you are afraid of being condemned to hell, as you are being fooled. It is alright,â€ù Ahok said. Ahok has apologized for the statement, which many Muslims found offensive. In Bandung, a number of schools sent students home early in anticipation of traffic congestion because of a rally staged by the Alliance of West Java Muslim Movements, demanding Ahokâ€™s arrest. The rally began after Friday prayers at 1 p.m. local time in front of Gedung Sate. The group then marched to the Merdeka Building. At least 1,000 people joined the peaceful rally, which caused traffic jams on a number of thoroughfares. Coordinator of the alliance, Asep Syarifudin, said the rally represented the struggle of the entire Muslim community in West Java. â€œWe demand a legal process for Ahok regarding the religious blasphemy he committed. His statement has insulted the Quran, ulema and Muslims,â€ù he said. Separately, Muslim Reformist Movement chairman Cep Hermawan said his side would stage a bigger rally at Jakartaâ€™s City Hall if the police failed to act against Ahok by Oct. 28. â€œUnless he is [legally] processed, on Nov. 4 we will surround the Jakarta Legislative Council building and City Hall. If Ahok is not punished, we will punish him,â€ù he said. In Padang, West Sumatra, 48 Muslim mass organizations grouped under the Minangkabau Community Forum plan to stage a rally on Sunday.

The policy aims to make the price of fuel in Papua and West Papua the same as prices in other areas across Indonesia. Â  Under the new policy, premium sells at Rp 6,450 (49Â US cents) per liter while diesel and kerosene are priced at Rp 5,150 and Rp 2,500 per liter, respectively. â€œResidents can now buy premium at Rp 6,450 per liter while diesel is sold at Rp 5,150, far lower than the previous rates, which ranged between Rp 50,000 to Rp 100,000 per liter,â€ù Jokowi said during the launch of the One Fuel Price policy for Papua and West Papua in Dekai, Yahukimo, Papua, on Tuesday. The President hopes the policy will directly impact peopleâ€™s prosperity. â€œThe prices should not be more than Rp 10,000 per liter. I will continue to monitor this. We should not let just one or two people enjoy the fuel prices enjoyed by other parts of the country, while others have to buy fuel at a higher price,â€ù said Jokowi. With the One Fuel Price policy, the President said state-run oil and gas firm Pertamina must allocate Rp 800 billion in subsidies every year. â€œThe most important thing is not about the money, but about social justice for all Indonesians,â€ù he said.

"Mon, October 10, 2016| 01:06 pm",Unbalanced wings of Indonesian politics,"Indonesian politics is veering to the right. Even though there is no clear classification for Indonesiaâ€™s political parties (nominally, only religious or nationalist), there are indications that show rightward sway in the countryâ€™s politics. Since reformasi, there have been two conservative laws or bills that have aimed to control peopleâ€™s â€œmoralsâ€ù, namely the Anti-Pornographic Law passed in 2008 and the bill on alcohol beverages currently under consideration. Recently, there has been an attempt in Constitutional Court to criminalize extramarital sex and LGBT relationships. Supporters of these moves argue they mean to â€œprotect moralsâ€ù because the regulated items are â€œagainst religious values.â€ù In the electoral cycle, there have been serious attempts to undermine certain candidates based on their religion or ethnicity, a move supported by national politicians such as Daâ€™i Bachtiar, former chief of the National Police, and Amien Rais, former speaker of Peopleâ€™s Consultative Assembly (MPR). These indications show how much Indonesians have either adopted or gotten used to ultra-conservative narratives of religious, moral and ethnic purity. At the grassroots level, Indonesians seem to be more and more permissive toward ultra-conservative activities and organizations. Permissiveness gives rise to organizations like Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia, which openly declared its aim to establish an Islamic caliphate in place of Pancasila democracy. HTI and other similar organizations have begun preaching to Indonesian youths. One high profile case involved HTI preaching at Yogyakarta Indonesian Art Institute (ISI Yogyakarta), which resulted in several lecturers refusing to teach subjects that mandated them to draw the human anatomy. Worrying findings from the Indonesian Institute of Sciences found that 84.8 percent of students supported the implementation of sharia law nationwide, something expressly against Pancasila. In and of itself, conservatism is not a problem. In democracy, people may live their lives based on their beliefs. However, it becomes problematic when there are attempts to impose these beliefs on a general populace that may or may not share them through legislations and other legal processes. These problems are exacerbated when the issues creep into personal space, such as sexual orientation and consensual sexual practices. In Indonesia, this is extra problematic as this practice undermines some local ethnic and religious traditions in addition to Pancasila. So, how did Indonesia get to this point? Mostly because hitherto the right-wing movement in Indonesia has been unopposed. Ultra-conservatism is a latent movement, existing before independence as militant Daulah Islamiyah, which opposes a secular Indonesian Republic. During Soehartoâ€™s regime, movements that openly challenged Pancasilaâ€™s ideological supremacy were suppressed. This included both leftists and Islamists. Soeharto effectively purged Indonesia of leftist sentiment when he came to power amid the 1965 communist cleansing. He was not much nicer toward political Islam, the right-wing power base at the time. He discriminated against devout Muslims from military promotions, forcefully fused Islamic political parties into one and even harassed Nahdlatul Ulama, a moderate Islamic organization. However, when his power began to waver in the late 1980s until the 1990s, Soeharto softened his stance and began an attempt to co-opt political Islam under his wing to garner support. Since reformasi, conservatives have made use of their newfound right to free speech and have thus begun to flourish. Elements of the conservatives have veered ever more to the right into the far-right category. These ultra-conservative groups continuously hide behind constitutional freedom of speech every time their activities are scrutinized by authority. For example, in 2015 when the government shut down several radical websites, there was an outcry denouncing the government for infringing on free speech. Curiously, the same grouping of organizations strongly supports the ban on communism in Indonesia, itself a violation of free speech. Meanwhile, the counter-balancing ideologies on the left of the political spectrum are still suppressed by the longtime ban of communism. Compound this with a general lack of political education and we have the recipe for jargon-based scapegoating. Using the latent fear of communism, far-right groups are quick to denounce opposing ideologies as communistic. Secularism is equalized with atheism. Liberal is the same as communist. This development is not in line with what the founding fathers must have envisioned for their newborn state. Pancasila as an ideology actually accommodates a wide range on the political spectrum. It includes religious conservatism of all religions by the first principle and nationalism in the third principle, humanism of classical liberal in the second principle and even the socialist concept of a welfare state in the fifth principle. The fourth principle embraces participatory democracy. Based on this, the general demonization of the left in an attempt to defend Pancasila would also be a ban on two principles of Pancasila (the second and fifth principles), an anti-Pancasila action in itself. This conception is acknowledged by Sukarno, the formulator of Pancasila himself, who declared â€œPancasila is leftistâ€ù in a cabinet meeting. So what should the government do? To crack down on the right is to return to the days of human rights violations. The government â€“and our society--should address it with democratic ideals in mind: by increasing quality and openness in our political life. Firstly, the government needs to provide better political education. Currently, they are focused on indoctrination of patriotism to the nationâ€™s youth. The fact is, this one-sided political education has made many young Indonesians ill-informed politically. Many cannot differentiate secularism, atheism, liberalism, communism and capitalism. The use of these words as political jargons creates demonizing effects, making open intellectual discussions of the topics almost impossible. This phenomenon of jargonism was famously visible during the 2009 presidential election when then vice-presidential candidate Boediono was disparaged as â€œneoliberalâ€ù without any explanation about what the term truly meant nor on why it would be bad for the nation. In another instance, a member of the MPR equated liberalism with the foreign colonization of Indonesia. The government could circumvent this phenomenon by offering better political studies, integrated with the existing citizenship subject for our school students. A politically active citizen should know about the political spectrum and its core tenets, and it should let them choose the political ideology that suits them best. A better education would make this use of jargon less effective as people would be able to research their own political opinions. Else, they will always be prey of populist politicians using political jargon in demonizing a certain group as a scapegoat. Second, the government needs to loosen restrictions on the left to effectively counter the far-right influence in politics. The formal ban on communism, compounded by society sponsoring the demonization of the left, has made no politician dare to openly take a leftist stance. In such a movement, left-leaning political stances, be it classical liberal, progressive, or socialist, are quickly dismissed as communistic and anti-Pancasila. Calls for a more impartial governmental approach in religious policies, protection of the LGBTQ community and the promotion of sexual health education are often branded as foreign-influenced decadence. These issues are important to discuss in a public forum but its discourse has been stifled. With government protection and support, voices opposing conservatism could gain more traction. Instead of the one-sided propaganda the people are receiving now, there would be fair discussions on political alternatives they could take. Ultimately, it is the governmentâ€™s duty to protect all political opinions as stipulated by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Indonesia is a politically confused nation. We defend Pancasila as native ideals while staunchly opposing foreign incursion on our sovereignty, yet we remain receptive of the Pan-Islamic ideology, whose aim of a unified nation based on religion undermines Indonesian nationalism. We oppose left-wing politics, denouncing it as communism and the enemy of Pancasila, not realizing that Pancasila itself is on the left of the political spectrum. We are unwilling to ban radical conservatives on the grounds of freedom of speech, yet at the same time we suppress the radical left with moderates left as collateral damage. We are still afraid of an obsolete Cold War era nemesis of communism while refusing to acknowledge the new rising threat against Pancasila being actively preached to our youths. Indonesia needs to change -- to wake up. Much like the mighty Garuda needs both its wings to fly, Indonesia needs both of its political wings to balance its flight toward prosperity.

The Office of the Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister revealed in July that cyberattacks in Indonesia rose by 33 percent in 2015 from the previous year, of which 54.5 percent were aimed at e-commerce-related websites. Most of the attacks caused systems to stop working. In the meeting, the President also told his Cabinet members to improve the management of state officials amid an era of tighter competition.

Instead of welcoming Duterte with a grandiose ceremony, Jokowi took the Philippine president to Pasar Tanah Abang, Southeast Asiaâ€™s largest textile market in Central Jakarta, in a blusukan (impromptu visit). Â  Wearing white shirts, Jokowi and Duterte walked among kiosks at the Tanah Abang Market after they arrived separately at about 2 p.m. Accompanied by several Cabinet ministers, including Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi and Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita, the two leaders visited several stalls at the market for about half an hour. Upon their arrival, Enggartiasto told reporters that it was important to introduce the market to Duterte, since the pasar is popularly known as a textile hub among the countries in the region. ""Thatâ€™s why we invited him: Because he [Duterte] is a type of person who wants to see something closely related to the people,"" Enggartiasto said. He added that Jokowi also invited Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to participate in one of his trademark blusukan when the latter visited Jakarta in November last year. Â  Hundreds of local people and market visitors packed areas visited by Jokowi and Duterte. Jokowi shook hands with several visitors who attempted to reach and take photos with him. Duterte smiled when he witnessed the people's enthusiasm over their visit. Presidential Press Bureau chief Bey Machmudin said Jokowiâ€™s blusukan was part of the Presidentâ€™s efforts to expand his diplomacy, ensuring that it takes place beyond discussion tables. Â  Indonesia is the first country Duterte has visited since he was inaugurated as the Philippine president on June 30. Earlier, Jokowi and Duterte met during the ASEAN Summit in Vientiane, Laos, from Sept.6 to 8.

Home Minister Tjahjo Kumolo said that, in accordance with the 2013 Law on Mass Organizations, the process of disbanding a legally registered mass organization took four to five months. ""The House of Representatives will hold a plenary meeting to discuss [the issuance of a Perppu].

""Pancasila as the sole principle should be embodied in every political party and mass organization. Every citizen has the freedom to associate, if [the association] upholds only Pancasila principles,"" Tjahjo said. The 2013 Law on Mass Organizations allows the government to disband organizations it considers to be in violation of the state ideology, but the government must follow certain procedures.

Donâ€™t let us lose our identity and character because our nation is widely known as a nation that is friendly, polite and well-mannered,â€ù said the President.

Speaking to The Jakarta Post right after the government announced the move on Wednesday, HTI spokesman Ismail Yusanto said the group had never received a warning letter. According to Article 62 of the 2017 Regulation in Lieu of Law (Perppu) on Mass Organizations, the government should issue a warning letter and terminate activities of an organization before revoking its status as a legal entity. â€œThe government has violated its own regulation. According to the Perppu, we should be subject to administrative sanctions first, not immediate disbandment,â€ù Ismail said. (Read also: Indonesia disbands Islamic group Hizbut Tahrir) The Law and Human Rights Ministry announced earlier that it had revoked HTIâ€™s legal entity status because the group had conducted activities opposed to Pancasila, the state ideology. Even though HTI had stated in its statutes and rules of association that it adopted Pancasila values, the group had advocated the establishment of a caliphate, reflecting an ideology that was not in line with Pancasila, the ministry said. The governmentâ€™s move to issue the Perppu has been criticized, because it allows the ministry to disband any mass organization deemed to oppose Pancasila without court approval, which some have called a setback for democracy, since the government could curtail the freedom of association and expression. The HTI is the first organization to be affected by the Perppu. â€œWe won't remain silent. Weâ€™ll fight back through a legal process,â€ù Ismail said, adding that the group had not yet decided what kind of legal process it would take, as it would first examine the government's decision.

"Wed, July 19, 2017| 09:46 pm",Hizbut Tahrir to challenge disbandment by government,"Muslim group Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) is set to file a lawsuit with the Jakarta State Administrative Court (PTUN) to challenge the revocation of its legal entity status and instruction to disband by the government, the groupâ€™s lawyer Yusril Ihza Mahendra has said. â€œWe know that our position is weak in facing the government, which has used the Perppu. We shouldnâ€™t give up on upholding justice, however. We shouldnâ€™t let a dictatorship exist in this country,â€ù said Yusril, referring to the Regulation in a Lieu of Law (Perppu) No.2/2017 on Mass Organizations, in a written statement on Wednesday, a couple hours after the government announced the official banning of the HTI. The government believes HTI contravenes the Pancasila state ideology as it promotes the Islamic caliphate (Islamic state). By issuing Perppu No.2 on July 10, the government gave the authority to the Law and Human Rights Ministry to disband all mass organizations regarded as contravening Pancasila without due process of law. (Read also: Islamic group Hizbut Tahrir condemns disbandment by government) The HTI filed a judicial review with the Constitutional Court to challenge the Perppu on Tuesday. However, Yusril said the group should take other legal steps because with the disbandment, it no longer had legal standing to file a judicial review. â€œWeâ€™re preparing the best step for the next action,â€ù said the former law and human rights minister. The Perppu has become a controversial issue and triggered condemnation from the public and rights groups as they are worried it could threaten the freedom of association and expression.

"Thu, December 21, 2017| 08:39 am",Commentary: Christmas is 'just' an ordinary birthday celebration,"It was Friday evening in Bethlehem in October several years ago. I took my wife to the rooftop at the home of a Palestinian Muslim family, who had invited us for dinner. We heard the azan (a call to prayer for Muslims) from a nearby mosque. She stood at her wheelchair and we sang Holy Night while looking at the Church of the Nativity where Jesus was believed to be born. I donâ€™t know why, but I felt more peaceful and more religious in Bethlehem than in Jerusalem, a holy site for Judaism, Christianity and Islam. â€œWe shall return,â€ù we said in our prayer. Our Palestinian host said Muslims are obliged to highly respect Jesus, a prophet in Islam. I told him that celebrating Christmas is more peaceful in Bethlehem than in Jakarta. Terrorist attacks have haunted churchgoers on Christmas Eve for nearly two decades. â€œThat is nothing compared to our suffering from the Jews here,â€ù the old man said. During our pilgrimage to Israel, and also Palestinian territory, we could easily see the Israelisâ€™ unbelievable oppression of the Palestinians. In Jerusalem it is easy to understand when people say World War III could start there. The Palestiniansâ€™ living situation is very inhumane. But they always smile at visitors despite the daily horrors they have to confront. But for me, Jakarta is more worrying during the festive days, especially because I worry about the safety of my wife, who was powerless when bombs exploded in our own church in East Jakarta in 2000 and again in July 2001. How about next Monday? I feel more secure now. But it is not because my faith is more mature or that I have completely surrendered my life to Jesus. The recent statement issued by an organization that is often feared by minorities like me, was a little bit heartening, no matter whether it is true or false. The Islam Defenders Front (FPI) said it would help safeguard Christmas celebrations at the National Monument (Monas). It was also very active in the recent demonstration to condemn United States President Donald Trumpâ€™s decision to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) has also recently softened its stance on expressing Christmas greetings. It had previously said it was not haram to say â€œMerry Christmasâ€ù to Christians. But now the ulemas apparently consider that the greeting is just a matter of courtesy. When I greet my Muslim friends during Idul Fitri, it does not mean that I become a Muslim too. The police have also not issued any warnings this year as they have done in previous years. But to be honest, it is hard to sense a merry atmosphere in Jakarta. Many shopping malls are refraining from openly presenting a Christmas atmosphere; some radio and TV stations are also not airing Christmas carols. Their position is very understandable, they do not want to create unnecessary problems for their business. Many, if not most, Indonesian Christian Protestants and Catholics laughed bitterly and were shocked when they heard last week that the FPI had stated it would support Christmas celebrations in the name of religious tolerance. Has a miracle happened or has Santa Claus come to town? For an ordinary Indonesian with little knowledge of theology or religion such as myself, every year the birthday of Jesus becomes a huge hullabaloo of security, political or social concerns, including terrorist threats, although it is actually just an ordinary birthday celebration. However the FPIâ€™s endorsement of Christmas likely applies only once and in one place. Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan has allowed Christians to celebrate Christmas at Monas after he recently permitted Muslims to hold huge gatherings there. Some Christians may say it is simply exaggeration. The FPI is always hostile toward any Christmas-related events or moments. Just Google it. â€œIslam is rahmatan lilâ€™alamin [a blessing for the universe] and is very supportive of pluralism, differences must be respected,â€ù tirto.co news portal quoted FPI Jakarta branch secretary-general, Novel Chaidir Hasan Bamukmin, as saying. The two largest Muslim organizations in Indonesia, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Muhammadiyah have regularly assured security during Christmas. But I have never heard such assurances from the FPI before. But who knows? Maybe we are totally wrong this time. The Indonesian Communion of Churches (PGI) has strongly rejected the offer to hold Christmas celebrations at Monas, while the Indonesian Bishops Conference (KWI) has taken the same position, albeit in a more subtle tone. Basically, they suspected the offer was made just for political purposes. Anies has dropped the plan and offered a more acceptable location. The PGI and the KWI have voiced the feeling of their followers. On social media, there are suspicions that Governor Anies and the FPI are suddenly being friendly toward them just to accommodate Christian relatives or friends of Gerindra Party leader Prabowo Subianto. But the reactions are sometimes too much and go against the teaching of Christianity itself. â€œI just want to slap the faces of those who want to go there [Monas],â€ù posted one social media user, while on the same page condemning the intolerance from the Muslim side. For me, whatever the motivation of the governor and the FPI, their statement is certainly interesting. Technically, Christmas is just an ordinary birthday celebration. Why should we make a big fuss of it? That is probably the reason why the FPI softened its position. Churchgoers will hopefully experience a beautiful day on Monday.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2017/12/21/commentary-christmas-is-just-an-ordinary-birthday-celebration.html

Rizieq was reportedly staying in Saudi Arabia following investigations of his legal cases. The West Java Police had named him a suspect in the defamation case against Pancasila in January, and he was also named a suspect by the Jakarta Police for pornography related to steamy chat messages he was allegedly exchanging with a woman named Firza Husein in May. Jakarta Police had since put him on their wanted list as he failed to answer summonses. Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan attended the gathering along with politician Amin Rais and Deputy Speakers of the House of Representatives Fadli Zon and Fahri Hamzah. The reunion rally was held to commemorate last yearâ€™s large-scale protest against then-Jakarta Governor Basuki â€œAhokâ€ù Tjahaja Purnama over his blasphemous remarks. National Police chief Gen.

"| Fri, September 22, 2017| 08:01 am",Unsung Museum highlights Indonesiaâ€™s democracy challenges,"The Museum Tanpa Tanda Jasa (Unsung Museum) is a landmark, traveling exhibition that is currently crisscrossing the country and features miniature artworks that are big on cultural significance. The exhibition highlights the most important issues challenging Indonesiaâ€™s ongoing struggle for democracy since the nationâ€™s colorful, fledgling journey began.Â  These issues include tolerance of minority groups, along with ethnic, ideological and religious diversity and collective harmony. Taking a series of chronologically banned, destroyed, removed or censored artworks the Unsung Museum displays them in scaled-down miniature versions of the real things. Accompanying these mini-masterpieces are news articles from the time, together with amusing parodied public reactions and news media video installations. â€œArt is no stranger to controversy; throughout its history it has presented works that have irked the moral guardians of the day,â€ù said Yogyakarta-based curator Grace Samboh, one of many members of the Indonesian contemporary art community who have initiated the Unsung Museum in an event that characterizes the social conscience and synergy of some of the countryâ€™s most relevant and motivated artists and activists. â€œSometimes to see why an artwork is deemed controversial, we need to see it from a different perspective, and what better way is there than to see it in miniature?â€ù An visitor attends the opening of the Unsung Museum at ROH Projects, Jakarta. (Wirya Satya Adenatya/File) Beginning September 2016 at Jakartaâ€™s ROH Projects, for three weeks the exhibition sets out to inform, not only citizens but also members of the Indonesian art industry, about the relevance of these pressing issues. The exhibition will be next showcased at Yogyakartaâ€™s Kedai Kebun Forum from late October running into November, then opening in West Java, at Bandungâ€™s Ruang Gerilya, 15 December until 7 January 2018. â€œWe are retelling stories of several artworks that were once considered a â€˜public nuisanceâ€™ during the Reform Era because of three recurring reasons related to pornography, communism and SARA [ethnic, religious, racial and inter-group relations] by three elements in society [citizens/individuals, mass organizations and government],â€ù Samboh said. â€œBased on these assumptions, several artworks attracted a variety of problems ranging from threats, restrictions and even destruction.â€ù The country with the largest Islamic population on the planet, with Christian, Buddhist and Hindu religious minorities, however, is currently undergoing one of its most turbulent and disruptive periods. The May 8 controversy at the Indonesian Islamic Universityâ€™s Center for Human Rights Studies in Yogyakarta with the censorship of paintings and poetry carried out by members of the youth organization Pemuda Pancasila who enforced the closure of artist Andreas Iswinarnoâ€™s exhibition, Tribute to Wiji Thukul: Saya Masih Utuh dan Kata-kata Belum Binasa [Iâ€™m still complete and words have not yet been destroyed] on suspicion the works contained communist ideas, highlights the urgency of the Unsung Museum. An visitor photographs part of the Unsung Museum. (Wirya Satya Adenatya/File) â€œBearing in mind a number of concerns about the stability of [ideas within] democracy, as well as democratic behavior in todayâ€™s society, our main question is: What does democracy mean to each and every one of us today, as part of society, as citizens, and as someone who works in the arts?â€ù Grace said, reflecting on the inspiration behind the exhibition. â€œWe have adopted the concept of a mobile museum for the exhibition because of its informative nature and educational aspects, as well as its openness to the public.â€ù The mini works collected by the Unsung Museum include versions of: â€œPinkswing Parkâ€ù, a walled photomontage by Agus Suwage and Davy Linggar, exhibited at the 2005 Jakarta CP Biennale, it was deemed to be blasphemous by Islamic fundamentalist group the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) who forced the closure of public access to the work, while demanding prosecution of the artists, and They Gave Evidence exhibited in 2002 in Jakarta by Dadang Christanto, a major series of standing, naked ceramic figures, in their outstretched arms holding the remnants of burnings, drownings, beatings and other human mutilations, victims of oppression, social injustice and political violence. Also collected are a miniature of a public artwork by Nyoman Nuarta that Islamic organizations protested against stating it was representational of Christian iconography and which was consequently dismantled from its site in West Java in 2010. Also, an work by Galam Zulkifli that was removed in 2016 from the new Terminal 3 complex at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. Â Zulkifliâ€™s enormous 12-square-meter painting included iconic figures in the development of the Indonesian nation.

An visitor to ROH Projects, Jakarta examines the Unsung Museum. (Wirya Satya Adenatya/File) â€œWithin conversations surrounding these artworks, the conclusion is often misunderstanding,â€ù Grace explains.Â  â€œThe arts community believes the dismissal of these artworks was due to some people having misunderstood or failed to understand altogether. In fact, quite often the misunderstandings come not only from those who dismiss the artworks but also from the arts community itself.â€ù â€œThe Unsung Museum is not an attempt to point out rights and wrongs. In light of democracy, we want to poke peopleâ€™s awareness of equality of knowledge about rights and obligations of the various elements in the arts communityâ€”within the art disciplinary context.â€ù Along with Grace the Unsung Museum has been initiated by Aliansyah Chaniago, Fajar Abadi RDP, Jim Allen Abel, Julian Abraham â€œTogarâ€ù, Maryanto and Tamara Pertamina, while inviting other people, and aspires to continue inviting more people over time. â€œThe Unsung Museum has already received a strong public response,â€ù Samboh said. â€œWe are now compiling the feedback, and the topics are being discussed in the hope that we can publish a book on views of our recent democracy through the art publicâ€™s perspective.â€ù â€œOur mission is to rekindle discussions about democracy in the Reform Era with the arts community while not closing itself off from the involvement of other members of the community.â€ù The Unsung Museum is scheduled to continue in Medan, North Sumatra, and Makassar and Manado in Sulawesi early in 2018.

According to Article 62 of the 2017 Regulation in Lieu of Law (Perppu) on Mass Organizations, the government should issue a warning letter and terminate activities of an organization before revoking its status as a legal entity. â€œThe government has violated its own regulation.

"Wed, July 5, 2017| 03:15 pm","Rather than move on, let's learn from divisive Jakarta election ","In the wake of Basuki â€œAhokâ€ù Tjahaja Purnamaâ€™s election defeat and subsequent conviction, there is a pressure to â€œmove onâ€ù from the chaos stemming from the Jakarta gubernatorial election. The whole episode was indeed an intellectually and emotionally draining experience for the entire nation. Yet to blatantly dismiss the consequences of this conundrum will eventually damage Indonesian political maturity and social cohesion. The Ahok controversy revealed social fractures which were well-hidden under the facade depicting Indonesia as a tolerant, moderate, and progressive Muslim-majority nation. Â Â  Firstly, the publicâ€™s political participation continues to be impaired by the symbolic versus substance dilemma. Â The primacy of symbol was exemplified in employment of identity politics as a political weapon and consolidation of power around certain celebrity-like actors. As long as identity politics remain influential, Ahokâ€™s political overkill will continue to send a discomforting message to any political candidate seeking the approval of constituents with different identities. The other side of the coin is the excessive adherence to those who campaigned against Ahok and his supporters. For instance, the leader of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) Rizieq Shihab launched an anti-Ahok campaign that was so effective that many were willing to disregard the FPIâ€™s harsh crusade for an Islamist agenda. The publicâ€™s unreasonable identification with the symbols envisaged by political actors will continue to hamper Indonesiaâ€™s democratic process, which ideally rests on rationality and critical thinking. This raises questions over the political maturity of a nation that prides itself as a democratic country. Secondly, the pressure to conform as seen in classic herd behaviour remains a strong force in Indonesia. Â Religion was utilized as an instrument when anti-Ahok rallies were mobilized. Muslims who embraced the groupâ€™s mentality were awarded with social acceptance by the majority group and also earned their place among the Muslim community that strived to safeguard the religion against a blasphemous governor. Those who rejected were threatened with ostracization, shaming, and even religious excommunication. The gravity of such punishment leads to self-censorship, explaining the lack of counter-arguments by Muslims in the blasphemy discourse. A conforming behavior to the anti-Ahok crowd would likely lead one to join future rallies demanding a religious Muslim in public office, if the public fails to assert a more critical approach to the issues raised during the anti-Ahok movement. Thirdly, the recent swing to conservatives indicates many Indonesian Muslimsâ€™ incapability to reconcile religious and national identities. While conservatism in itself is a not a threat to the nationâ€™s integrity, it may serve as a platform for the Islam supremacists, which some quarters are all too happy to pursue at the moment. Not only the demand for pious Muslim politicians and leaders, we now face an uptick trend of the disavowal of Pancasila values in favor of Islamic ideals by social media users.Â  In pluralistic democracies, compromise is a necessity for society to function. But the recent call for Islamâ€™s dominance in political, economic, and social spheres raises notÂ  only fears among minorities regarding their rights and place in plural Indonesia, but also among multiple Muslim groups with differing approaches to the relationship between religion and state. Calls for Islamic dominance also turns Islam into a lucrative political currency in Â political contests, allowing it to be further exploited by pragmatic actors who donâ€™t Â not necessarily follow Islamâ€™s values and ideals, and limiting the expression of any seemingly non-Islamic political system or worldview. This explains the mounting pressure to expunge the values of Pancasila as it places Islam and Muslims on equal footing with other religious groups, therefore denying the primacy of Islam in the public domain. In conclusion, the controversy around Jakarta gubernatorial election should be a wake-up call to question some of the basic assumptions about how Indonesia is perceived. These include the portrayal of Indonesia as a success story of Islam-democracy reconciliation, the image of a tolerant and harmonious nation, and the image of Indonesia as a progressive Muslim-majority country. Rather than pushing to move on from these latest polemics, Indonesians would do well to wrest this moment to understand how events unfolded as they did from an educated and critical lens. In this era of information, however, people must be smart in forming their opinion of how religion should play a role in a multicultural and multi-ethnic setting. As we just celebrated Ramadhan and Idul Fitri, there is no better time to engage in self-reflection on how we could improve ourselves as Muslims and as patriotic citizens of our nation. *** Muhammad Sinatra is an Analyst in the Foreign Policy and Security Studies (FPSS) at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) Malaysia.

"Fri, June 16, 2017| 03:20 pm","As homelands devastated, Indonesian tribe turns to Islam","Indonesian tribesman Muhammad Yusuf believes his conversion from animism to Islam in a government-supported programÂ will eventually make his life easier. ""Thank God, the government now pays attention to us; before our conversion they didn't care,"" says Yusuf, the Islamic name he has adopted. Yusuf is a member of the ""Orang Rimba"" tribe. His small community now gathers around a stilt-mounted wooden hut, while children inside wearing Islamic skullcaps and hijabs enthusiastically recite the Koran. Not far away, other members of the tribe who remain faithful to the old ways stalk through palm oil trees in a desperate hunt for prey in an area that was once lush Sumatran rainforest. Stick-thin and wearing only loincloths over their weather-beaten skin, they brandish homemade rifles as they search for their next meal. Yusuf's group converted to Islam, the predominant faith in Indonesia, and gave up their nomadic ways in January in a bid to improve livelihoods that have been devastated by the expansion of palm oil plantations and coal mines into their forest homelands. Authorities insist the move is positive but critics say it amounts to a last throw of the dice for indigenous groups driven to desperation by the government's failure to properly defend their rights against rapid commercial expansion. Indonesia is home to an estimated 70 million tribespeople, more than a quarter of the total 255-million population, from the heavily tattooed Dayaks of Borneo island to the Mentawai who are famed for sharpening their teeth as they believe it makes them more beautiful. But as a nomadic group, the Orang Rimba -- whose name translates as ""jungle people"" -- are a rarity. Read also: Measles outbreak hits Orang Rimba tribe Big changesÂ  This photo taken on May 19, 2017 shows children from the""Orang Rimba"" tribe -- whose name translates as ""jungle people"", who have been converted to Islam and given up their nomadic ways, wearing Islamic skullcaps and hijabs as they gather to recite the Koran, in the Batang Hari district of Jambi province. (AFP/Goh Chai Hin) The 200 who recently converted in the Batang Hari district of Jambi province -- a handful of the approximately 3,500 Orang Rimba -- decided to turn to the Muslim faith after being approached by an Islamic NGO, and the social welfare ministry has helped with the process. Community leader Yusuf conceded the reason they were converting was because food was increasingly hard to find and they were constantly locked in disputes with companies on whose lands they hunt, rather than due to any deeply-held beliefs. Â  The tribesman also said that he and his family -- he has 10 children -- wanted to get national identity cards, which would allow them access to public services including education and healthcare. Converting to Islam and settling in one location means they can get the cards. The decision has meant big changes. The converts now live in basic wooden huts on stilts and no longer move to a new location every few weeks. TheyÂ are fully-clothed in items donated by the government and NGOs, having abandoned the simple loincloths and sarongs they wore in the past. ""It's nicer living in a village like this, our lives are better,"" said Yusuf, whose old Orang Rimba name was Nguyup. They have not completely abandoned their animistic traditions however -- the tribe believes spirits inhabit the trees and their wavy-bladed daggers -- and view Islam as a religion that overlays their own, ancient beliefs. Not all of the Orang Rimba are keen to convert however. Just a couple of hours drive away, a group of about 300 Orang Rimba live under blue, plastic tarpaulins propped up on sticks and subsist by hunting the few animals they can find amid the palm oil trees. They move on average three times a month in the hunt for new prey, and every time a member of the group passes away, as required under tribal customs.

""According to our tradition, conversion is not allowed,"" leader of the group Mail, who goes by one name, told AFP. It is also in part due to superstitious beliefs. ""We're afraid if we break our oath, we will be captured by tigers,"" Mail added. Conversion of tribespeople to Islam is not uncommon in Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country, and the government insisted the change would be positive for the Orang Rimba. Hasbullah Al Banjary, director of indigenous communities at the social affairs ministry, said it was now easier for authorities to provide for the tribespeople as they were not moving around. He said their traditions would not be eroded. ""Itâ€™s a creative culture which has local wisdom we need to preserve,â€ù he said. But indigenous rights defenders insist some tribespeople feel they have no option but to convert. ""I view this as a result of the state failing to protect them,"" Rukka Sombolinggi, secretary general of leading Indonesia indigenous rights group AMAN, told AFP. Â  ""They turn to clerics or the church in some areas, because they offer protection."" In recent decades, Indonesia has lost huge areas of rainforest -- the habitat for many indigenous groups -- to make way for plantations for palm oil, pulpwood and rubber, as well as coal mines.Â  Critics say local governments have prioritised making bumper profits by issuing permits for companies to set up operations rather than protecting tribes, who typically have no formal title to areas where they live. Yusuf said he feels a sense of ""tranquility"" after converting -- but admitted it had not been a quick fix and his group were yet to receive the coveted identity documents. ""It's now up to the government -- if they care about us they will work on our ID cards,"" he said.

"Tue, June 13, 2017| 03:19 pm","Vigilantism: A relic of the past, now threatening the future","Indonesians may feel relieved now for the government and police have acted swiftly and firmly on cases of vigilantism done by radical group Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) towards people who commented on the pornographic case involving the groupâ€™s leader Rizieq Shihab. National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian said that the vigilantism violated the laws and would be firmlyÂ dealt with. Two men directly involved in intimidating a 15 year old boy of Chinese descent in East Jakarta have been arrested. Solok Police chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Susmewalati Rosya was replaced over her inability to prevent the persecution of a physician at Solok Regional Hospital, Fiersa Lovita. It is in our hope that other vigilantism cases will be handled justly by the national police. So far, the Joko â€œJokowiâ€ù Widodoâ€™s administration shows commitment to uphold the rule of law and to punish those who violate the basic principles of the Unitary State of Indonesia, state principles Pancasila and state motto Bhinneka Tunggal Ika (Unity in Diversity). The purpose of the radical group members are clear, they are committing a political terror to silence the people and to discourage positive reaction towards governmentâ€™s action. More specifically, they want to spread anti-Jokowi sentiment on the grassroots level. The government had previously banned the anti-Pancasila and anti-diversity Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI). While FPI is not banned (yet), there are a lot of indications that FPI sponsors various anti-Pancasila and anti-diversity sentiments. Rizieq has been repeatedly reported to the National Police's Criminal Investigation Department (Bareskrim) for his various public statements that contain elements of religious blasphemy, insults on the countryâ€™s first president Sukarno, Pancasila, and Sundanese people. It was Sukmawati Sukarnoputri who reported Rizieq for his insult on Sukarno and Pancasila, which stated that, â€œIn Sukarnoâ€™s Pancasila, belief in one and only god [the first principle] is on the butt, while the Jakarta Charterâ€™s is in the mind.â€ùÂ  The meaning is clear, Rizieq wishes to reinstate the Jakarta Charterâ€™s version of the Pancasila, implying a more Islamic Indonesia that upholds sharia law. He aims to change the revolutionary spirit of our founding fathers, who did not want to see Indonesia become an Islamic country, due to the countryâ€™s diversity principle. Hence, it is obvious that Rizieq has violated the essence of the first Pancasila principle which has been recognized as the stateâ€™s foundation. Rizieq has been named suspect in a pornography case, with other cases still in the investigation process. These cases can lead to the disbandment of FPI in Indonesia. The last National Awakening Day commemoration on May 20 gave a ray of hope since the government and various political organization seized the moment to emphasize the importance of defending our unity, the pluralistic Indonesian nation that embraces various cultures and traditions including that of Chinese-descent. Jokowi brings back a habit from Sukarnoâ€™s regime in celebrating the birth of Pancasila every June 1. The celebration holds a significant meaning since on June 1 1945, Sukarno presented the basic principles of Pancasila as state foundation in the BPUPKI meeting, supported by the countryâ€™s founding fathers. Sukarno firmly stated that Pancasila reflects the main characteristics of the nation: upholding interreligious tolerance, pluralistic Indonesian nation, a just and civilized humanity, democracy, and law that guarantees social justice. Our founding fathers clearly intended a nation that is against sharia, that upholds democracy, against racism, against vigilantism and other human right violations, and also against corruption that eats away peopleâ€™s welfare. The motto Bhinneka Tunggal Ika emphasizes this anti-racism view and shows that Indonesia is against the tyranny of majority and oppression towards minority.Â  Indonesian government under Jokowi administrationâ€™s firm stance against vigilantism or intimidation has been a correct one. Vigilantism is an obvious crime that violates not only the law but also Pancasila.Â  To gather peopleâ€™s support in defending the state, Pancasila, our diversity and the constitution, it is important for the government to spread awareness of the past. Under the New Order, there were a lot of violations of the basic principles of the nation. From 1965 to 1967, Soehartoâ€™s regime not only supported but also led the mass killings of millions of innocents, capturing and prisoning hundreds of thousands, and persecuting many others. Hundreds of thousands of prisoners of conscience and persecution of those seen as leftist continued for decades. All these violations of law and Pancasila happened without adequate legal process. Ironically, Soeharto justified these violations, saying that he was upholding Pancasila and implementing the constitution.Â  Now, several figures who rely on the support of Islamic radical organizations â€“that wish to turn Indonesia to an Islamic state based on sharia lawâ€” are a part of political force involved in those past violations. They are also those who become opposition of the Jokowi administration, who want to continue the corrupted system that has disadvantaged the people. If the 2019 presidential election runs similarly with the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election, with money politics and intimidation based on race and religion and other legal problems, these people can once again lead the nation.

"Mon, May 15, 2017| 09:01 am",Ahok ruling raises tension,"The highly divisive blasphemy conviction against non-active Jakarta governor Basuki â€œAhokâ€ù Tjahaja Purnama has sparked tensions in some regions, with supporters of the Christian governor upping the ante against the Islamist group that has been calling for his incarceration. The situation in West Kalimantan, which saw hundreds of people killed in two bloody ethnic conflicts in 1996/1997 and 2001, is particularly worrying as rising sectarian tensions in the capital have reignited suspicions among different religious and ethnic groups in the province. Mercelina Erni, 46, a Christian resident in the provinceâ€™s capital Pontianak said she had heard rumors, mainly from social media, that raids were imminent against Dayak people and Christians. â€œI had to take down the rosary I used to hang on the rearview mirror of my car when I heard the rumors,â€ù she told The Jakarta Post on Sunday. The rumors were triggered by a speech made by West Kalimantan Governor Cornelis, in which he said he would oppose the presence of Islam Defenders Front (FPI) leader Rizieq Shihab, a vocal antiAhok figure, in the province. The Dayak people, one of West Kalimantanâ€™s largest ethnic groups, have expressed their support for the governorâ€™s stance. On Friday, two FPI leaders, Sobri Lubis and Hidayat Quaiandri Batangtaris, who came to Pontianak to inaugurate members of a local FPI branch, were forced to return to Jakarta only 30 minutes after landing at Supadio International Airport. Authorities said they asked the two FPI leaders to return because of security concerns. The incident has angered a group of people claiming to represent Malays and Muslims. They called on authorities to prosecute the governor for stoking sectarian tensions. Meanwhile, rumors are also rife that some Malay and Muslim groups plan to disrupt an annual cultural event to be held by Dayak people in the city on May 20. Leaders of Dayak and Malay communities have met to respond to the rumors and called on the public to remain calm. The Pontianak Police have also beefed up security in the city and gave an assurance that authorities would act professionally in handling possible clashes. â€œWe have prepared 4,000 personnel from the police force and the Indonesian Military to maintain security. We will take action against anyone who tries to disrupt security, â€ù said Pontianak Police Chief Sr. Comr. Iwan Imam Susilo. Dayak people account for around 35 percent of West Kalimantanâ€™s population, followed by the Malay (34 percent), Javanese (10 percent) and Chinese (8 percent). Sixty percent of the provinceâ€™s population is Muslim, while 34 percent is Christian. In predominantly Christian Manado, North Sulawesi, hundreds of people on Saturday swarmed Sam Ratulangi International Airport and the governorâ€™s office to protest againts the presence of House of Representatives deputy speaker Fahri Hamzah, who was accused of supporting the FPI. The protests came just three days after thousands gathered in the city for a candlelight vigil supporting Ahok, who is now detained after being sentenced to two years for citing a Quranic verse in a speech deemed as blasphemous. â€œFahri Hamzah is not a tolerant person. That is why we reject his presence here,â€ù said Brian Maloor, chairman of a local group that participated in the Sam Ratulangi rally. Fahri had to be evacuated by the police after spending only six hours in the city. In other regions, the FPI has been more daring in carrying out their actions. In Makassar, South Sulawesi, dozens of alleged FPI members attempted to disperse a group holding a candlelight vigil for Ahok. Salim Said, a senior political and security analyst, expressed concerns about the rising sectarian tensions, which he believed could threaten the countryâ€™s diversity. He called on the countryâ€™s leaders in Jakarta to be fully aware of the situation to prevent horizontal conflicts. Meanwhile, Indonesian diasporas in major cities abroad have held rallies to support Ahok and Indonesian diversity, including in Amsterdam, Auckland, Los Angeles, New York, Perth, Sydney, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto and Vancouver.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/15/ahok-ruling-raises-tension.html

"Mon, May 8, 2017| 03:26 pm",Jokowi administration moves to ban Islamic group,"Following a string of sectarian rallies in the country's capital and other provinces, the government decidedÂ on Monday to ban the hard-line Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI) group on the grounds thatÂ its activitiesÂ contradictedÂ the Pancasila state ideology and had becomeÂ a threat to the countryâ€™s unity. The ban recommendation, if passed by a court, would be the second time the government banned the activities of religious minorities in the country. President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo's administration banned earlier the Fajar Nusantara Movement (Gafatar) and evicted members of the group from theirÂ settlement in Mempawah, West Kalimantan.Â  Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Wiranto announced the decisionÂ on MondayÂ on the sidelines of a ministerial meeting to comprehensively examine all mass organizations in the country, a move taken amid growing radicalism in Indonesia. â€œThe President has instructed us to review all mass organizations to identify those with values that contradict Pancasila or the unity of the state. [â€_] As a legally operating organization, the HTI has no positive role in achieving the national goal,â€ù Wiranto told reporters at his office. â€œHTI has also promoted values that contradict Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution. The activities of the group have also collided with the public, thus poses a threat to the unity of the republic [of Indonesia]. For this reason, the government has decided to ban the HTI,â€ù he said.

"Mon, May 8, 2017| 09:28 am",Calls for tolerance spark controversy in Aceh,"After making strongly worded remarks against radicals propagating intolerance in his province, West Kalimantan Governor Cornelis was less than welcome by a group of conservative Muslims in Aceh. The group, calling itself Islam Defender Troop (LPI), visited the hotel where the visiting governor was staying in Banda Aceh on Saturday, demanding he leave the city over statements they deemed â€œintolerantâ€ù and â€œprovocative.â€ù They claimed Cornelisâ€™ statements had been the reason for two clerics being turned away from Pontianak a day earlier. â€œAceh land is haram for those who hate ulemas and Islam, including Cornelis,â€ù said Tengku Achmad Shanjy, one of the protestors. Cornelis had come to the city for the opening of a national meeting of farmers and fishermen, which was also attended by President Joko â€œJokowiâ€ù Widodo, on Saturday. The protesters lingered in front of the hotel until the hotel management said the governor had already checked out from the hotel. Over the past two weeks, West Kalimantan has been gripped by a filmed speech that went viral on social media, in which Cornelis threatened to oust radical and provocative individuals who had â€œthe gutsâ€ù to enter his province. Many considered the footage provocative, claiming it stirred up sectarian sentiment. Speaking in Pontianak on Thursday, Cornelis addressed the controversy over his speech, saying he would fight intolerance in his province. â€œWith regard to intolerance, I frankly challenge those who are radical and intolerant to leave West Kalimantan,â€ù Cornelis said. The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) politician added that history showed that 17 massive riots had occurred in the province so far, resulting in West Kalimantan being economically poor and left behind. â€œI donâ€™t want this to occur again,â€ù he said during the handover ceremony of the West Kalimantan police chief post from Insp. Gen. Musyafak to Brig. Gen. Erwin Triwanto. Erwin promptly held a meeting after his swearing in ceremony with representatives of different religious and ethnic groups in the province to talk about rising social tensions. The meeting was held in response to a planned visit by Sobri Lubis and Hidayat Quaiandri Batangtaris, clerics from the Islam Defenders Front (FPI), to Mempawah regency. When the two arrived at Supadio Airport in Pontianak, police asked them to go back to Jakarta, citing security concerns. â€œWe have told the organizing committee that [it is not recommended] to invite figures considered to be provocateurs,â€ù Erwin said. Earlier, Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) deputy secretary Tengku Zulkarnain, who traveled along with Dayak Culture Council (DAD) leaders from Pontianak, faced rejection from a group of people upon arriving at Susilo Airport in Sintang regency. The cleric was turned away because he had allegedly insulted the Dayak. A staff member who accompanied Cornelis to Aceh, Awie, said the visit had gone well despite the protests from conservative groups. He said Cornelis and his wife had still spent Saturday night in Banda Aceh and the governor had taken the opportunity to meet local leaders. â€œ[Cornelis] was safe and Madam Governor could still shop for souvenirs. I was there with them,â€ù he told The Jakarta Post on Sunday night. He refused to confirm whether the governorâ€™s entourage had to change hotels after the protests.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/08/calls-for-tolerance-spark-controversy-in-aceh.html
"Tue, May 2, 2017| 09:08 pm",Islamic scholars told to take leading role in countering intolerance,"Lecturers at state Islamic universities, known for their moderate and progressive interpretations of religious tenets, should be at the forefront in tackling the rise of intolerant groups that try to dominate public discourse by exploiting religious sentiment, a scholar has argued. Unlike lecturers at state universities, academics at state Islamic universities have more authority to talk about religion, especially Islam, and to counter the rhetoric used by hard-line groups such as the Islam Defenders Front (FPI). â€œI can debate [with them] in politics or economics, but when they start using religious verses [to counter my argument], I am done,â€ù Freedom Institute executive director Rizal Mallarangeng said at a book discussion at the Syarief Hidayatullah State Islamic Universities in Ciputat, Banten, on Tuesday. Rizal said Islamic scholars countering the rhetoric of intolerant groups was nothing new. He mentioned respected figure Nurcholish Madjid, aka Cak Nur, as an Islamic scholar who spread the message of moderate Islam and therefore significantly contained violent religious ideas. â€œWe need more people like Cak Nur or Gus Dur,â€ù Rizal said, referring to the late former president and pluralism hero Abdurrahman â€œGus Durâ€ù Wahid. Gus Dur was also a former chairman of the Nahdlatul Ulama, the nationâ€™s largest Islamic organization. â€œWe need to reinforce the role of the UIN in countering radical ideas [â€_] this is work for the UIN,â€ù said Iding Rosyidin, head of the political sciences department at the university.",http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/05/02/islamic-scholars-told-to-take-leading-role-in-countering-intolerance.html

Separately, Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) consultative board chairman Din Syamsuddin said Muslims should be independent in politics, considering Indonesia is a Muslim-majority nation. ""Defending the interests of Muslims means defending the interests of Indonesian citizens [...] We hope there is a solution for political parties to defend Muslims"" Din said. Judges presiding over Ahok's trial are set to announce their verdict on May 9.
